# Project Timeline
<p style="color: #e11d48"><b>Warning:</b> Run the program to generate new data won't update the Excel sheet. It was made after the data was scraped from the web, cleaned and the gpt analysis were made</p>

## First Step (Project Structure)
We first (obviously) decided about the project theme (Games), and divided the project into phases, each phase with someone responsible.

## Second Step (WEB Scraping)
Matheus, Thalis and Bruno were responsible for scraping the data, they decided two game sites. They choosed Steam and IMDB, steam because it is the most large game store with lot of avaliations and comments, and IMDB to get some other informations that were useful for the analysis

## Third Step (Cleaning the Data)
Matheus was responsible for cleaning the data too. Removing all noise from the data and generating the base CSV sheets

## Fourth Step (Generating the GPT Analysis)
Jo√£o Pedro did the communication with the GPT, passing the data obtained from the previous steps to the AI, cleaning the noises from the responses and generating new informations and data from the AI analysis

## Fifth Step (Creating the Excel Sheet)
Alex was responsible for creating the Excel, he did all the Pivot tables and links between them, and so the Graphics and the entire Dashboard.
