Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Truly unique.;IMDb isn't really a site designed for people to rate video games, but this entry is too much fun to not talk about, so I'll write a review anyways. If you look deeper into my ratings you'll notice how I gave all the Zelda games I've played a perfect 10. I love the series' storytelling, quirky characters, engaging puzzles and charming level designs, but I do often wonder if these games deserve such a high rating. They do slightly suffer from repetition (Ganon must have multiple lives!), and there are a few irritating glitches that can hinder my overall enjoyment. Which is fine because, after buying the Nintendo Switch and trying this game out for a few good hours, I think this game is worth all the hype. And what hype it has!In short, this game is an absolute blast. Open-world games have been done before (Skyrim), yet every little detail, every little technique, and the various ways you could go about on your adventure make this huge world feel fresh and exciting. There is so much to do in this game, and it never gets boring! Link could climb up steep cliffs, transport to towers, paraglide, and enter "Shrines" to solve puzzles by using magic in clever ways. Even the horse-riding was fun! I love how immersive this world is, because everything (graphics, controls, gameplay) is so flawlessly executed and so absorbing. It breaks a few video game conventions we're so used to, making this game an exciting, entertaining ride filled with smooth game-play and fun characters. I haven't gotten too deep into the game yet, so I can't really comment on the main storyline too much. So far it has the typical Zelda formula, but with an interesting techno-twist that doesn't feel misplaced. The character interactions are natural, and the quests push the story forward instead of making them feel like filler. So far a good start.Overall, this game is innovative, breathtaking, challenging, imaginative and endlessly addicting. I believe this is one of Nintendo's most well-crafted games they've made, and I'm not saying this out of pure nostalgia. If you're a Zelda fan, a casual gamer, or someone that thirsts for adventure, this is a great choice.;9/10;9 March 2017;44 out of 51 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;A True Masterpiece that may be the Greatest Video Game ever made!;Easily one of the greatest games of all time, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild delivers a satisfyingly beautiful presentation on scale, world building, story, gameplay, and design. Most of my gripes are buggy graphics and such that have more to do with the Switch's shortcomings as opposed to the games'. And even gripes that are the game's fault are done purposefully to make the game better. If you play this game you will certainly not be disappointed.That was the short version, long version of why this game is awesome along with a plot synopsis will continue now.Synopsis: A century before the game begins, the peaceful kingdom of Hyrule was attacked by an evil entity known as Calamity Ganon, who is the game's version of the usual Zelda villain Ganondorf. Princess Zelda and her knight Link, fight the evil Ganon but lose, and Link barely escapes with his life. He's placed in a bed of water inside a cave for a hundred years and when he wakes up with no memory of what happens, he has to fight to defeat Calamity Ganon and his minions to purge Hyrule of its darkness.Okay so first the plot. I'm not too familiar with the canon storyline of Zelda, but from what I've heard the game's storyline is completely original, at least in its structure. I really like how it got the elements of Zelda's story and broke them up into little parts and built up in its own unique way.And surprisingly enough for such a simplistic children's story of good versus evil, it's very compelling. Link's memories become somewhat of a mystery and how he is in a world he has to defend but not remember becomes very interesting. Sure the whole "You don't remember me but you should" angle from almost every NPC becomes pretty flat, but I'll admit that its very compelling.What limits the stories RPG elements such as the bog standard story and robotic NPCs are pretty much forgotten. I mean, the game is just genius. The music is atmospheric and engaging, what should make the game boring and forgettable such as the conventions of video game RPGs and fantasy instead make the game more classic. The combat sticks to the average shift and strike sort of method but still remains very very fun. There were times when I was on the edge of my seat, just slamming the respawn button to get back at an enemy in the game who defeated me.Speaking of which, this game does not treat you like a baby. It doesn't hold your hand through a two hour tutorial, the handling of mechanics is very straightforward, and most of all the difficulty. On a scale between a Disney Channel online game and Dark Souls, Breath of the Wild is somewhere in the middle. It's easy enough that you can progress without being a hard core gamer, but hard enough to want you to keep getting stronger.Likewise, there's something here for everyone. Hard core RPG fans can enjoy the rich worldbuilding and character design. Fantasy nuts can really enjoy the brilliantly created setting. And people who like fighting games can enjoy the very fun combat angle which is a very refined system which is based both on the player's skill and items. Everyday people who aren't too into gaming and just want to escape for a little can enjoy how investing the gorgeous graphics of the game are.My gripes actually have reasons for them existing. I really don't like how weapons can break because its annoying to get a really cool or powerful weapon just for it to break two seconds later. However it prevents players from creating an overpowered build and flying through the game. I also don't like how the loading screen had awkwardly scratchy transitions and how riding at full gallop on a horse can make the bottom part of the screen sort of have an annoying 'ghost effect'. Again, this is the Switch's fault, not the game's.Another gripe I have is the reliance on more powerful weapons as opposed to skill. To defeat stronger bosses you just need better arrows, which can be bought with the game's currency rupees. But this is just pretty tedious, grinding away at weaker enemies and selling their drops to exchange them for arrows.Again this can be blamed on the simple fact that the game is an RPG, grinding is a simple facet of every role playing game. But it also limits the game heavily, you kill monsters to get drops, you sell drops to get rupees and spend rupees to buy arrows which defeat stronger enemies. You spend rupees on arrows pretty much. While limiting, I prefer this to simply having a purely skill based system which obligates newer players to just give up instead of grind when they reach an area of the game with too strong a boss.Another gripe is that there is no simplified progression system to track your progress. Sure there's a 'Quest Log' that tracks how many quests you completed but still, on the game as a whole there is no way to know how many items you've obtained, there's no EXP system to boost your stats and most of all, and out of all of the game's content, how much of it you've experienced. Really enjoyable games such as Chasm, Assassin's Creed and even Lego Star Wars had clearly defined systems that let you know how much of the game there was left to uncover.But like my other gripes I understand this entirely. In order to let the player create his own adventure instead of having a streamlined system tell him how much is left to uncover, he or she has to do it on his own, a surprisingly smart system for forcing the player to tackle the game on his or her own terms. Like Skyrim, the player does not have to follow the main story to progress through the game. He or she can take on side quests, dungeons and simply explore the game's magnigicent setting. This, like the removal of the average 'game percentage' aspect really allows the player to have the best experience possible.The game gives an engaging experience on every level imaginable, from the simplest design to the most complex. The original game 'The Legend of Zelda' followed Link on his journey to reunite the pieces of the tri force, but this game focuses on Link's journey to defeat Ganon to free Hyrule from his grasp. The game does not retcon the whole series, but instead uses its elements in a new and intelligent way. It uses canon elements like building blocks to create its own beautiful masterpiece of a story and game. Unlike most RPGs, there is no leveling system, but instead...shrines which have replaced dungeons. Each shrine includes various obstacles, puzzles and enemies, at the end of which is a statue that gives you a Spirit Orb and a full health regeneration.Every four Spirit Orbs lets you become stronger, either giving you an extra heart, or more stamina, which you use to run, glide and climb. There are over a hundred unique shrines with their own design and that in itself is genius and scrupulous game design. Can you imagine that? More than a hundred specially designed rooms, each with their own loot and obstacles. This really is a masterfully crafted game, with tons of effort and creativity thrown in. Little bits of fun here and there such as little 'Children of the Forest' or spirits, which have the most unique and interesting design, occur almost nine hundred times. How amazing is that? Nine *hundred* seperate encounters with unique spirits, each that give you seeds to max out your inventory. That is just one of the many aspects of the game that make it the most engaging and well designed video game ever made. The sheer amount of effort and ingenuity put into this game really shows, from the plethora of uniquely designed characters and monsters, items, dungeons (shrines), bosses, and puzzles.I've never wanted to play a game that I hoped never ended except for this one. And when I finish it, I will probably play it again and again. And if you try it, you probably will too.;10/10;31 December 2018;26 out of 31 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Very possibly the best game ever made;Wow. This game may not be perfect, but it's damn near it. Possibly the best launch title for a game system ever. But if you're not quite sold on the Switch, I would get a Wii U, some games, and BOTW. Everything about this game is the most perfect it could've been. Screw XBONE, PS4, and PC. You don't have BOTW;10/10;7 March 2017;33 out of 41 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Legend of Zelda Breath of Fresh Air;I have spent my whole life playing the Legend of Zelda series loving each entry of the series, however over time I have noticed that the series has become far too formulaic and after Skyward Sword hand holding was taken way too far. Which is why I am glad to say that Breath of the Wild has taken every bit of the formula that was monotonous and threw it completely out of the window.For the first time since the first entry way back in 1986 you have complete freedom of how you want to approach the game. From the very first moments you see the world unfold around you it won't be long until you get to explore the large and vast world of Hyrule.After you complete the very brief tutorial of the game you can go wherever you want and do whatever it is you want to do. Feel like going straight to Hyrule castle to fight Ganon? Go ahead but don't be surprised if your ass gets completely handed to you.One thing to note in Breath of the Wild is that the difficulty of the game when it comes to combat has become increasingly harder and you must learn to adapt to new ways of handling these encounters as you play. There were many times I would be killed again and again forcing me to keep loading back into the same confrontation which forced me to change my approach.With all my praises of this game the one complaint I habe is the story itself which given the scope and scale of the game I expected to be much more. I soon realized the true story of the game is your adventure and when I came to think of that I didn't mind so much that the story wasn't stronger as my adventure and my journey throughout the game was so fun and compelling that there were times where I didn't even notice the story so much.I really hope to see where Nintendo can take the franchise from here and with their new approach to the Zelda formula I hope to see many Zelda games with this level of freedom in the future. A definite must own for Zelda fans and even those who are curious or new to the series.;10/10;1 September 2018;19 out of 23 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Zelda just keeps getting better and better installment by installment.;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an amazing game that will surely be seen as a go-to definition of open-world gaming comparable to Grand Theft Auto or Super Mario 64. and even a little Skyrim-esque in parts. Breath of the Wild feels like a Zelda game, but also feels like an adaptation of the games by Hayao Miyazaki's team at Studio Ghibli. This game is unimaginably gorgeous to look at and play. Its scope is nearly quadruple that of Ocarina of Time (and I freaking LOVE Ocarina of Time), and it's such an enormous game that I wonder if I'd dare to say that it's even BIGGER than G.T.A. V. Also it's the launch title that made the Nintendo Switch SOAR to the top of the charts!Get this game if you're a human being with a pulse and who has a strong love for all things video-games. Also, this is THE Zelda game for anime fans to get into.;10/10;17 April 2018;16 out of 20 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;The best Zelda game of all time;What can I say besides "what a god damn excellent game" as a Zelda and open world game fan I was more than satisfied!;10/10;21 August 2020;8 out of 9 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;One of the best games I've ever played!;A huge problem with previous Zelda games is the limited freedom. Nintendo completely changed that with Breath of the Wild.As soon as you walk into the endless world of BOTW, EVERYWHERE you see you can visit, heck if you want to, you can run in and defeat Ganon without anything! It truly is a change to the Zelda series. The story-line is great and the cut-scenes with voice acting make it seem that much more interesting. Plus, with the Switch, you can play a major console game on the GO! (Beat that Horizon Zero Dawn and any other Switchless console/PC game.)Another great thing about BOTW is all of the side quests, shrines, korok seeds, DLC and MORE! So when you finish the main quest you haven't finished the game. There are still places you can visit and hundreds of things you can do among all of the side quests, DLC, etc.No game is perfect, it does have some flaws such as the occasional drop of frame rate however it has improved and doesn't disrupt the experience.Overall, it's an excellent game for young to old, zero Zelda experience to an Ultra Zelda Fanboy and non-gamer to hardcore gamer.;10/10;19 August 2017;12 out of 15 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;A huge success for the franchise;In my opinion, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a perfect representation of how the series started and what it was supposed to be. An open world game where you can explore the vast world and complete your quests however you please. It's a great experience for both beginners to the series and hard-core fans of the Zelda franchise.;10/10;8 May 2017;11 out of 14 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;This game makes you feel guilty for spending so much time indoors;This game places you in the middle of a massive land so detailed and beautiful that it truly depresses you that it's not real. There are areas where the temperature goes down or up and you have to deal with it. It rains and that affects things like climbing (speaking of climbing, you can climb almost every surface in the game). You have stamina which makes you have to think about how you will get from point a to point b. The game makes you think the way you would if you were truly in the wild.On other notes, the story's great, the npcs and all fun, the combat is excellent, and the shrines are a real treat. But the best part about this game is the freedom you feel of simply being in the great outdoors where you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want.;10/10;27 September 2021;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Amazing;This is the best game I played becuse the map is realy big it has long gameplay and good storyline;10/10;23 June 2020;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;My favorite game ever!;This game is everything I wanted with an video game. The exploration, the lore and gameplay is just well done. It hade been a long time since I first played it and I recently picked it up again and is still just as amazed as the first time.;Not Informed;11 August 2022;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;I don't know how I feel about this game;While most of the Zelda games have had quite a bit of world-building and exploration, they took this to a whole new level here. The world and exploration is more vast. I hope Nintendo continues with the open-world idea. I was eager to explore more of the world with this game. The world is immersive and you can cook your own food, run into people, encounter shrines, build your own house and town, and other challenges...there is a lot of things you can do in this game.I guess I'm in the minority here, I don't understand why people dislike the Divine Beasts dungeons, I thought it was a neat concept to have you control the divine beasts while also figuring out the puzzles in the dungeon. But I think it's because I'm a sucker for puzzles. Too bad you can't go near them after you defeated the bosses. I mean, what if there's a chest in there that you may have forgot? I love most of the champions and how they give you powers after you complete each Divine Beasts.Gameplay aside, the story was so-so and again too dramatic. The story was nearly non-existent, there is like no established story except for you have to defeat the Divine Beasts, find all the memories, and defeat Calamity Ganon. I didn't like the idea of Link waking up from a hundred-year sleep with amnesia and some of the characters such as Zelda, Impa, and Revali were annoying characters to me. Zelda is an overemotional brat who pressures herself, takes her stress out on Link and cries too much. Some people do complain about how stoic Link is in this game and it makes me wonder why Nintendo downgraded Link's expressions in this game after the last few 3D Zelda games had a more expressive Link in my opinion.Some things didn't make sense such as the Master Sword killing you. The ending didn't make sense and it didn't seem to wrap everything up. It just ends with Zelda and Link looking up at the sky and how did Zelda survive a hundred years and hold in Ganon for this long? Wouldn't that be tiring for her?I don't know if I should recommend this game or not, it's okay but the story seems pretty short and non-established. I do feel it's overrated. Also, Zelda and her relationship with Link was off-putting. I don't ship Zelink and not in a million years do I want them together.;6/10;13 March 2018;11 out of 35 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Overated;This is the worst gaming experience i've had since Fortnite. The storyline is weak af and world is empty. The only thing that was good about the game was finishing it because it was that bad. Nintendo needs to make good games like Agar.io or they will be cancelled.;3/10;20 January 2020;7 out of 65 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Link is amzing;Wow this is just an amazing game i love it so much i do not remember seeing an amazing game like the legend of zelda Just a creative game at an open world level at the highest level I could really imagine gameplay I did not know and I really like to know I have been a fan for years and I just have not been such a really good game in terms of industry and good in my opinion 10 out of 10 is without a doubt really among my favorite games I've finished it three times already and it took me a full time to finish it but overall I enjoyed every moment and I think every good Zelda player dealing with Nintendo must play this game.;10/10;1 February 2022;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;The best game ever made. Period;I have played a lot of games in my life but none of them left an impact on me the way BOTW did. I was never Zelda lover before so i decide to by this game randomly because of a the positive reviews it got. From the moment i started playing the game i was overwhelmed because this game doesnt hold your hand ...it sets you free to discover the kingdom as you please. You can spend hours just roaming without even accomplishing a single thing and it will feel like a few min have past becasue there is so much to discover. My 3 kids got addicted to this game by just watching me play. What a wonderful experience and im so grateful i randomly decided to buy this game. At 36 years old i fell in love with Zelda and i cannot wait for BOTW 2.;10/10;5 September 2019;10 out of 13 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Impressive to a First Timer;Though I didn't really grow up playing Zelda on the NES or SNES I've come to fall in love with the series over the last couple of years, from the music to seeing some of the games, I thought what a better time to finally make the plunge and play the game than with the hotly anticipated BOTW for Nintendo Switch and Wii U. I chose the Wii U version.Of course the story is pretty simple, Gannon is evil, now stop him and how you do that is largely up to you. The routes you take, the quests you do, the story you watch take shape through your actions or lack of actions. I've never been a big puzzle game person and BOTW will offer some puzzles ranging from tutorial to head scratching that requires some deep thought on the best way to solve. Many of these puzzles do have multiple ways to solve it.The vast open world wastes no time getting down to business with nothing more than a pair of shorts you are thrusted and expected to figure things out. Thankfully the game is very intuitive it's not hard to pick up on what needs doing and how to do it, quickly, especially in combat. As the game progresses you continue to explore the large and vast world of Hyrule and figure more challenges and obstacles, much through trial and error.Traveling is time consuming, you will spend a great deal of time moving from place to place. There is always something to see and do, finding a shrine to solve a puzzle or uncovering more of the map by climbing large towers. Doing the shrines is optional but will benefit you in the long run by allowing you to increase health and stamina to better handle the obstacles.Combat while intuitive is more often a hassle than a reward. Weapons are puzzling fragile and break after so many uses. While weapons and shields plentiful, you're still limited by what you can carry, unless you want to embark on quests to expand your inventory by finding tiny little needles in the large haystack of the world. Breaking weapons is all to common as even with the best weapons you're still only doing chip damage on tough enemies and bosses.Cheap one-shot-kills also seem oddly common, even when equipped with armor getting a single arrow in your side or a lucky swipe from an enemy you'll be dead before you hit the ground. The game can still be forgiving in this sense, when you are knocked on your knees you'll have a decent moment to get back up to defend yourself before more damage can be done. Save scumming can help prevent excessive setbacks and the auto-save system works as well as it needs.I can't speak for the Switch but the Wii U version suffers lag and even momentary lockups at times. I know this game has been in development for a long time and I know game consoles like the Switch aren't made overnight so no doubt R&D and development had to have been working on since the early days of the game's production but the fact the issues are happening when the Wii U has been on the market for several years, this is a first-party-in-house development by Nintendo just screams amateur hour.BOTW is a visually impressive and fun game with a few minor irritants. The frustration though does lead to more and more desire to continue and push on instead of surrendering and that is the mark of a great game.;9/10;14 March 2017;14 out of 20 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;My favorite of the 3D Zelda games, perhaps my fave period;I enjoyed the 3D games such as Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess. however, I also found them to contain flaws. Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess I found the dungeons over huge, Majora's Mask I felt was too repetitive and then Windwaker I found to have a very bland over world as it just took forever to sail to places. Skyward Sword I could not even get through because there was a really good game in there, but it was plagued by the WII's shoddy controls. This one though was just great, not perfect, but closer than any of the other 3D perspective games I have played. My other super favorite Zelda game is the one for the Super Nintendo, Link to the Past. This Zelda game is more about exploring and I enjoy doing that a lot. There are dungeons, but they are navigated easily and it doesn't take all that long to get through them and I did not need a guide to navigate them! A real treat and a great entry to the series.The story has Link awakening from a slumber with no memories. He gets a device called a Shieka Slate that helps him navigate the world and he sets out on his quest to stop Ganon who is at it once again! Link must find shrines to increase his power, he must free the guardians to gain powers and help aid in his quest to defeat Ganon and he must help the lands become free of terror that is Ganon!The game play is mainly exploring as you get to got where you want after you get through the first plateau and get the glider. Granted, it becomes easier getting places the more stamina you build up as this Link has amazing climbing abilities! It is fun just searching for towns, stables to spend the night and checking the map and seeing if anything looks interesting to explore. You can find this little guys called Koraks that give you seeds that help expand your inventory and you can find shrines to help you can heart containers and more stamina plus there are fairy fountains to help increase the strength of your inventory. Weapons break in this one and at times that was a bit annoying, but not as bad once you get the master sword. I also wish Nintendo had a trophy system because it would have added more motivation to complete quests, as you do not get all that much for completing most quests, usually just rupees which are kind of plentiful in this one.So, definitely my favorite of the 3D perspective Zelda games and perhaps my fave period. I loved the exploring aspect of the game, though I did not really take advantage of the horse riding in this one. I was afraid I would miss too much riding the horses. It is fun finding new places in this one, as I said I would open the map and try to figure out an interesting place to go during my quest. Where a shrine might be hidden or a Korak may be hiding. I liked freeing the guardians and gaining powers that would help me survive longer or explore more fully too. Just an incredible game, I like this format and hope they do a variation of it for another Zelda, but perhaps add a few more typical dungeons to change it up.;10/10;12 March 2019;10 out of 14 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild;Obvious;I mean this game is a masterpiece, anyone who says otherwise has probably not even completed the great platue.Got a friend who tried the game once, then I asked how he liked it, and then he said it was boring. I asked him how far he was into the game, he said he didn't know. I asked him if he had gotten the paraglider and he didn't know what it was. And then I said he hadn't even completed the tutorial. Lmao.Then I got another friend that I let borrow my game to try it. A week passes and I ask, how did you like it? He responded I played for 10 minutes and then didn't want to play more because he said he didn't like the graphics. Bro what?;10/10;5 May 2023;3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;This game took control over me;This was a really good game, I really liked the graphics, the gameplay was fun and the whole idea of the player being able to take over creatures in the Mario series was a really good one. Although I really liked the idea of being able to take over creatures in the Mario series in my opinion there was to little times I actually felt as if I needed to relay on this game function, I also think that the story was a bit bland and I know this is a Mario game and it's supposed to be easy but I like a challenge in a game and in my opinion this is way to easy. So to sum it all upp Mario odyssey is a good game with a few flaws (in my opinion) :);7/10;2 July 2019;4 out of 10 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;It has good graphics and that's about it;After 3 straight console failures from game cube, Wii and Wii U. When Nintendo Switch and the new gaming era rolled in, Super Mario Odyssey was one of the most hyped games. Yes they were excited for the 200th Mario game.Yes. Another Mario game that consist of the same hash that he has been doing for the last 30 years. More jumping on mushrooms. Getting level ups, beating Bowser and saving the Caucasian princess.This time though, Mario has a hat and the hat is alive.Mario Oydessy is nothing special. If you played one Mario game then you played them all. When you have little brainwashed cousins, then you have to take advantage to play the game for free and thank a god for freebies because this game is not worth more than 10 dollars to say the least.There really isn't anything good about this game. Sure I mentioned graphics but even mobile games with hash graphics are great games but this game is not a good game due to its history of having to do the same exact hash for over 30 years.Last Words: Fanboys will like anything Nintedno makes.

Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;Best Mario game of all time;This has got to be my favorite Mario game of all time.Mario odyssey by far has the best gameplay of any Mario game. There are so many options for moving around, jumping, attacking, and more. Cappy makes the game even better, as not only does he allow you to capture certain enemies, replacing power ups in this game, but he also makes your gameplay even more skilled, due to being able to jump on your cap. With this gameplay options, at some points you might just find yourself messing around with the controls, jumping and swinging from area to area like I do.The game runs at a smooth 60 FPS, and the visuals are stunning. The landscapes in this game are incredibly detailed and interesting.The soundtrack is fantastic, with awesome songs with a variety of different arrangements that combine to create songs that you're sure to come back to.The story is pretty basic, but that's not a necessarily a bad thing due to being just a Mario game. There isn't anything wrong with the story either, it's just a lighthearted and fun story that ends with a pretty great ending.What's great about this game is that it encourages the player to play how they want to play. You might go through some of the intended route on your first playthrough, but in future playthroughs you'll find yourself going through most of the game your way, which is really fun. Not to mention how replayable this game is. You will find countless of things to do both during and after you complete the main story, including many interesting side quests and several fun minigames.Overall, this is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. If you're planning on getting Switch or already have one, this is the game to get.;10/10;31 January 2023;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;Jump Up Superstar;Super Mario Odyssey is one of the best Mario games I played and a really good debut as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. It has been a really big addition as a video game icon featuring a greatly told story. It's about Mario saving Peach because she's about to be forced to get married by Bowser with a help with a Bonneter who transforms Mario into whatever the hat lands on. The gameplay makes the game fun to play. The characters, even the bosses, are very well developed. And the biggest highlight, amazingly crafted graphics. The game has featured beautiful background in some kingdoms and includes great looking textures. This is definitely worth playing for Nintendo fans and have played other 3D Mario games these years. This is an example of how Nintendo games can come out so great.;9/10;1 March 2021;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;Best 3D Mario since Galaxy 2;I must say, Nintendo really surprised with Super Mario Odyssey. I just love how unique and how much of a departure the game play is from its predecessors. For the first time ever in a 3D Mario game players can explore vast and complex 3D worlds. A truly open world experience backed up by the amazing Cappy mechanic Mario can posses various npc's, enemies, and even inanimate objects by throwing his hat. I believe the Cappy mechanic and vast open world to explore provides much needed depth to the Super Mario series.;9/10;2 March 2020;2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;What a game;As said by critic Armond White, Mario is a director who achieves the impossible while botching the basics. No more is that true than with Super Mario Odyssey. While it is much better than the previous film The Phantom Menace, it still is very flawed.The acting is often criticized as well as the dialogue, however the real problem is the combination of the two. The style of dialogue that Mario wrote requires a certain kind of actor, and he miscast many of the roles. As proof you can see that while the dialogue sounds unnatural and emotionless from Natalie Portman, one of the most accomplished actresses in cinema, it works perfectly from Christopher Lee. The casting is the problem, not the dialogue or the acting.The visuals are also a weak point with mediocre cinematography that's a massive step down from the original trilogy, and distractingly bad CGI.However the film gets a lot right.The music is incredible as always, and it really is what sells the whole film, even with its flaws.The worlds of Mario are engaging and interesting and full of atmosphere as always.But of course the most important part of movies is the story. The immediate story of the film, the storylines that begin at the beginning and end at the end of this film, are fairly mediocre. Somewhat entertaining but fundamental structure flaws prevent it from being something great. It's the overarching story of the 6 films that is what works in this film. The story of the 6 Mario films is one of the greatest stories ever put to the screen, and this film is a crucial part in that.There is no other word for the film than a mixed bag. At its worst, it can be incredibly boring and frustrating to watch. Throughout most of the film it's just mediocre. But at it's best, it's very good. Overall it's pretty good and definitely worth a watch.;10/10;31 March 2022;1 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;A great game? Yes. An industry icon? Not anymore.;As my first game on the Nintendo Switch and my first Mario game since GameCube, Mario Odyssey was a great way to get a feel for a new console. It has a lot of different movement mechanics which are a little tricky to get the hang of, but fun to feel yourself improving with. Each zone has a unique theme and enemies that can be controlled with marios hat and I cant say there's really a weak level in the game. The best one for me was definitely the Metro.Few games have this much variety in their gameplay, but the game also never goes too far in depth with any of these ideas. There will be many areas, mechanics, and techniques that few people will even use, and again, its definitely a game that feels rewarding to improve with. That said, the overall challenge in Mario Odyssey is very low, and because of this I wasn't compelled to go any further after completing the game once. This is an EASY game to complete, and there is basically no penalty for dying. This game has a target audience that still keeps the franchise alive, but at the same Mario is not doing anything to innovate or push the industry forward in any big way.Mario Odyssey is a great game for the Nintendo Switch, but you have to realize that when you compare mario games to other triple A games throughout gaming and the top games on PlayStation and PC, it really is NOT anything special or earth shattering like its many fanboys insist that it is. Mario and Nintendo as a company only survive inside their own vaccum. Mario Odyssey is a great game in its own right, but it simply is not the industry icon it used to be. For me, a video game doesn't receive a perfect score just because it doesn't make any mistakes. It needs to be setting bars and expectations for other games. Neither Odyssey nor the Mario franchise are doing that. Nintendo is making good games that enough people enjoy. Thats it.;8/10;17 June 2022;0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Nintendo;Super Mario Odyssey;A Game Worthy of 3D Mario;Follow Mario around the world as he and his hat attempt to save Princess Peach from Bowser.The game is fun, exciting, and packed full of things to do. It is a little simple, and maybe too easy at times, but I chalk that up to it being aimed at a younger audience. Besides, I've always found that the point of Mario is fun, not difficulty.The game is jammed pack full of things to do, find, and explore. It feels like Super Mario 64 with it's level design, but without the hub world. Of the main 3D Mario console games (64, Sunshine, Galaxy), I would say Odyssey is a solid mix between 64 and Galaxy. Personally, I found Galaxy (and Galaxy 2) a little more fun to play through.;7/10;8 July 2021;2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Nintendo;Animal Crossing: New Horizons;A great game, but...;Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a fantastic game and will keep you hooked for several hours. The gameplay basically consists of working you way up from a tent to a fully furnished house, farming fruit and vegetables, catching fish and bugs, buying and trading items, and digging up fossils.You also have the abilities to change the landscape, this includes adding or removing rivers, clifts, pathways, plants and trees. You can also build many other things, such as fairgrounds, parks, and any other buildings a town could have.Doing all the above is a very enjoyable experience, however you do get to a point when you think "what now!" and you feel you have hit a brick wall and there's not much else to do. However, as the game runs in real time new things happen on certain days, such as Halloween, Christmas Day, etc. One thing that really annoyed me in the game though was the fact you had to wait a WHOLE day to build, move or demolish a bridge or building! So if you wanted to move around your town it could take weeks as only ONE building or bridge can be moved per day...crazy!The amount of work and detail that has gone into Animal Crossing: New Horizons is unbelievable, it looks absolutely fantastic and plays like a dream! Saying that, many Nintendo developed games are also polished to a very high standard.Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a very worthy purchase, but you will eventually get bored with it and wanting to swap to another game. I think Nintendo could improve Animal Crossing, possibly taking a few ideas used in games like Stardew Valley.;8/10;21 November 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But this game became even more for me when I started suffering with depression and anxiety.

Nintendo;Animal Crossing: New Horizons;It's my favorite animal crossing game I've ever played :D;This game is a masterpiece. Working up to a 5 star island is a great feeling, especially when I get up too a new star rating. I sometimes wake up at the time it resets to another day (5:00 am) just so I can see pretty island sunset. The feeling of going outside and fishing, catching bugs, looking in the shops for cool items and clothing, and every thing else you can do in this amazing game everyday is really fun. My favorite part was when I got a 3 star island and I had a beautiful K.K. Slider concert. But I don't like having to pay my debt, and it is a bit annoying when getting stung by wasps and getting bit by spiders and scorpions. The first times I got stung and bit were scary, I thought the spider was a regular bug, and I didn't know looking for sticks would turn into me getting stung. I tried new leaf when I got my DS, and I really didn't like it that much because I didn't know how to fish or catch bugs and I couldn't make my island as beautiful as I wanted it to be. The only BAD part of the game was the eggs and zipper bunny. But with that gone, this game really helps me forget about how scary and terrible the world is right now.;10/10;3 July 2020;3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Nintendo;Animal Crossing: New Horizons;The best cure for being down in the dumps...;When this fine mess regarding the COVID-19 pandemic started, I was cooped up in my first apartment playing the same old video games I was playing (Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, The Sims 4, Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled, etc.), and they started to make me go stir crazy over not being able to do the things I would normally get to do......and then along came this Animal Crossing game I've gotten word of mouth from from a bunch of net friends. However, the first time I was able to experience this Animal Crossing game and know what all this Animal Crossing fuss is all about was when I picked up a copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons at Walmart, which I hadn't been able to set foot in since the pandemic began.At first things were boring. I started out with a few other villager animals that are still on my island (which I called GreenAcres after the 1960s sitcom of the same name) named Sterling (an eagle) and Hazel (a squirrel). Since it was my very first Animal Crossing game I had ever touched in my life, I got stung twice by wasps after shaking their nests out of a tree (ouch!), causing me to faint.I won't go into much detail, but when I finally got a grip on how to get more stuff in Animal Crossing (and get me a house in the game) thanks to the powers of the Siri function on my iPhone, I sometimes will drag on with a session of this lovely game for what may seem like more than three hours. And you gotta love Isabelle, Tom Nook and his Nooklings (Timmy and Tommy), among other characters.Bottom line, this Animal Crossing game got me through some hard times, whether it was COVID-19, being evicted from my first apartment (for being a noisy neighbor), or just if I'm feeling down. This is why Animal Crossing: New Horizons is still my go-to game on my Nintendo Switch to this very day.Thank you Nintendo for making this game my favorite.;10/10;20 December 2021;0 out of 1 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Animal Crossing: New Horizons;A bit of an overrated game.;I was so excited to get this game, I watched so many gameplays on YouTube and it just got me so hyped up. I remember the day that I got it i was so excited and instantly started playing. The game was pretty fun and I overall had a great time playing it, but around a month and half of playing I started to notice some flaws. First of all, I really disliked how you had to wait a whole day (and sometimes more) to do some things. The daily tasks I made myself do were never fun, it felt boring and grindy, and it overall wasn't that good of a time. Another big problem I had is how much the house extensions were, It was pretty hard for me to make money and probably took me 2 weeks to get to 100k. I literally had to pay 90k bells for my one room of my house to get a tiny expansion. Also, advancing the main story line felt like a drag. I'm not the most creative person ever and instead of enjoying decorating my island i instead always got so stressed out because of how ugly everything looked, I couldn't even put the villagers houses in good looking places. ANOTHER thing is that the whole museum thing was cool at first but quickly became bland and a bit grindy. On top of all of that, I had to share an island with 2 other people which just made everything harder than it had to be. Why couldn't Nintendo make it so it would be 1 island per account? So yeah, I haven't gone to my island in months now because it just got boring overall, and I don't plan to return any time soon lol. I know this isn't the popular opinion but I just wanted to give out my own opinion on this game. Please, either like or dislike this review, I want to see if anyone agrees or disagrees with me.;4/10;2 July 2021;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Animal Crossing: New Horizons;Mayhaps a bit too consumeristic?;I was so excited when I got this game as a present in May of 2020! I saw a lot of the game play on YouTube and I was constantly thinking about my island. While the ease of play is nice and understandable, there are a lot of features that you would have to buy to make the experience more enjoyable, including the DLC, Amiibo Cards, and Nintendo Online. I think that having these consumeristic features in the game makes it more P2P, rather than F2P and it gives F2P players a disadvantage. Other than all of the buyable features, I really like how there is a lot to do in the game, like fishing, bug hunting, completing collections, and expanding your island. The events are also a fun touch. Overall, I would recommend this game for someone who has completionist urges.;8/10;6 December 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Animal Crossing: New Horizons;Buying More Than One Switch?;If you own your own switch or buy more than one Switch - this game is pretty good.

Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Most addicting fun I've ever had;Tears of the kingdom is honestly a curse, there's so much to do. When I finally put the game away to go do schoolwork or sleep or something like that I'm always thinking about what I'm gonna do next. Those who say it's just 70 dollar dlc are just being critics to be critics at this pointOf course the graphics aren't going to blow you away and it's locked at 30 fps but that barely even takes away from the experience, and that's more of a switch problem than a tears of the kingdom problem. This game also shows how you don't need good graphics to make a good game.Overall, don't let the 70 dollar price tag deter you. This game is absolutely worth it. If you own a switch and can afford this game I would say it's a must have.;10/10;18 May 2023;18 out of 24 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;The Best Game of All Time.;My title holds some weight, I know.Calling a game the "best game of all time" will always be subjective, but to call this game anything but a piece of art is criminal. I've seen a few reviews here that rate 6 and below, and I don't think I've agreed with almost anything they've said. Sure there are some minor story and performance issues, but neither effected me too much in my experience, not to mention the performance issues being a byproduct of this masterpiece being a switch title. And even then, if you have a good enough PC, just pick up a physical copy of TOTK and then play it on your PC, they deserve the money for this title.This game is not only the sequel to what many considered one of the best games ever made, it is BETTER in every aspect. To call BOTW a better experience is near blasphemy on gaming, don't get me wrong, I love BOTW's setting and story elements as much as the next person, but this game expands on everything BOTW had and MORE, a better setting, a better more fleshed out story, quite literally everything is better.Unique Mechanics, an Improved world from the previous game, a good story, an amazing score, incredible art direction, good combat, MANY enemies to fight, adding basically an entire maps worth of new area to explore, DUNGEONS ( I continue to hear "these aren't dungeons!" from people, but they are Dungeons. This is just like when people said BOTW wasn't a Zelda game back in 2017. ) and so much more I can't even list off the top of my head as I just did the aforementioned features.Calling this game DLC shows that you fail to understand what a sequel is. I didn't see people crying over how God of War Ragnarok's map was reused, but because it's Nintendo, it's instantly bad. I'm not trying to defend Nintendo, as they do happen to produce half baked spin-offs quite often, but that's a topic for another review.This game captivated me like no other, BOTW was a magical experience, and this game caught that feeling into an intricately wrapped gift and gave me the exact same feeling, but a new and fresh experience. I may as well treat this game's existence like the second coming of christ, because dear god have I never loved a game more.I currently have 100 hours on the game, which may not seem like much at the moment, but I'm not even nearing the completion any time soon.Tears of the Kingdom is truly something out of this world, and I don't think the gaming landscape is going to see anything like it until the next Zelda game releases, which I have high hopes for.;10/10;5 June 2023;12 out of 15 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;An outstanding sequel;Just a heads up this review has no major spoilers.From the moment this game starts you are in for an immersive experience. Anything from the story to the actual gameplay is phenomenal. The overall performance of the game will encounter very few flaws.(but yes they are there just not very noticeable) If you are a long time Zelda fan or you are a fan of open world type games you are in for an absolute treat! This game is not even close to what you consider just simply " Botw DLC" it's so much more than that and it really stands out not only as a direct sequel but as it's own title as well. There has been moments that were jaw dropping as well as moments that had my heart racing from excitement. Overall, the music, the graphics, the exploration, the story and game mechanics are to die for. Pick up this game immediately and ignore these people who claim this is just " DLC" it's so much more than that!;10/10;22 May 2023;14 out of 19 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Tearing up;Tears of the Kingdom had to live up to the impossible expectations of being a sequel to one of the best games of all time. What is even more impossible is that it not only lived up to those expectations, it blew past them in every possible way.My personal worry while waiting for this game was that it would be good, but it wouldn't capture the same magic of exploration that Breath of the Wild did. The game soon proved me wrong with it's sheer size and vastly changed Hyrule. The game world has been changed to a point where it's near unrecognizable apart from the huge landmarks, and the added layers of verticality expand upon the world to be more than double the size.I was immediately lost and overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff to do and explore, see how my favorite locations have changed etc. But in an absolutely good way. Really, the amount of times I was distracted from what I was doing only shows how magical exploring Hyrule again was.The new abilities and mechanics are a joy to toy around with, and the physics engine is so in depth that the possibilities given to the player are almost truly limitless. There are countless ways to solve puzzles, and probably as many for straight up skipping them. The vehicle building was an unexpected but definitely welcome addition and I had way too much fun designing the worst and most cursed ways of traversal.It is amazing how good the game looks even with the limitations of the Switch. The art direction is absolutely gorgeous and I would often stop and just enjoy the view, accompanied by the immaculate sound design. The atmosphere is so good that I enjoyed even just walking through the environment.That being said there are also moments where the Switch doesn't pull through in the form of janky textures, very noticeable pop-in, and occasional frame drops. Even then the game was too good for these problems to hinder my overall experience.The story is a simple but functional Zelda story so it is nothing amazing, but the high points and climaxes still hit extremely hard. Especially the finale was exceptionally good, one of the best videogame finales out there.Everything I hoped for and more, a true masterpiece.;10/10;28 May 2023;12 out of 16 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Excelent Game!!!;I have spent over 120 hours playing this spectacular game. At first, I thought it was a bit overwhelming, but as I made my way through the map and unlocked this new world, I realized it was much more than just a simple DLC. It offers new stories, characters, and adventures. Don't pay attention to those people who say it's just a new DLC. for me, it's something new while still appreciating all the good things from the previous game! The gameplay mechanics are very different, which can make it seem complicated, but after playing it, you will once again immerse yourself in a fantasy world that only Nintendo can achieve!Excellent game!;10/10;23 May 2023;10 out of 14 found this helpful.

Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Really Good;(I'll update my review as I play through the game). I love the sandbox elements of the game and the new abilities that Link has access to. They are much better than what we had in Botw because they interact and are integrated with world in a much more engaging and interesting way. I also love the new enemy variety and bosses. It is much more similar to what we would expect from a Zelda game. However, the dungeons are still not what I want from a Zelda game. And the game in general doesn't really feel like what I've grown to associate with Zelda. I know many people dislike linear games but I think a linear experience doesn't run the risk of ruining the experience for players who do things the "wrong" way. Additionally, the story and progression can be more potent and fun. I firmly believe that a linear experience is a more consistently powerful than an open world experience. I love the freedom but eventually since the story only ends when you want it to, by the time you finish the game it will have lost its appeal whereas a linear experience gets to end the game with a bang. My biggest issue though is still the dungeons. In older Zelda games you would slowly unlock parts of the dungeon making the whole process satisfying as you would go through the dungeon one door at a time. Then halfway through you would get a key item as a reward for a mini boss and would be forced to use the item as a sort of tutorial. As you went through the second half of the dungeon you would become more and more comfortable with the item and finally, as one last challenge you would be tested on your knowledge of the new item and the dungeon as a whole. It was a satisfying experience that left me hungry for more and excited for the next dungeon. That just isn't the case here. There's never the wonder of "what item am I getting here?" or "what cool puzzles will be featured?" It's just a slog to do dungeons. I love the game but I honestly wish that the dungeons were more linear. However, they are significantly better than Botw dungeons and are actually fun so that is a big step up. Additionally, and I don't know if I'm the only one who's noticed this, but the game looks noticeably better than Botw which was a high standard. The enemy variety is very refreshing after the repetitive enemies of Botw. The new bosses are also very appreciated. I remember heading into the depths and then getting jump scared by a giant Obsidian Frox that freaked me out. In general the exploration has gone up from a 9.5/10 in Botw to a very easy 11. Now every corner of the world is not just filled with things to find but meaningful and exciting things. I recently found the torse to the Twilight Princess set and let out an audible squeal of joy and excitement. Overall, I won't give the game a ten until I've finished it but it's getting there.;10/10;18 May 2023;9 out of 15 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Surpasses the Original in Every Way;This is the most freedom I think I've ever felt in a game. Throw on the pro HUD (removes mini map, etc.) and you're left with the beauty of exploration. Every botw problem has been fixed, but this feels more like a completely new game from the ground up that just happens to follow botw. It's a fun world to slowly unravel and figure out, and certainly makes the overall challenge more about traversal and discovery than simply fighting enemy after enemy. It rewards patience and resourcefulness. You can't simply run or climb to every spot on the map. Some places you can't reach. Some you can't even see. Considering that the main goal for Link is simply finding Zelda in this massive world, the point of the game is interacting with and manipulating one of the most responsive and vibrant open worlds yet experienced in a video game.;10/10;26 May 2023;6 out of 10 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Near perfect game;I had never owned a Nintendo console nor played a Zelda game in my 33 years. I have always been Xbox, a little PlayStation and some PC in terms of my gaming.I took the dive into Tears of the Kingdom and my goodness.... It's just breathtaking, it feels so alive, so interactive and fun, the countless systems in the world and interactivity between them.A stunning map that feels large but not overbearing like recent Assassins Creed games, fun quests, amazing combat and movement.It's just so damed good. I wish I had got into breath of the Wild years ago.I think the only thing holding this game back is the old Switch hardware, this game on PC or Xbox would be nuts but that's not happening so all we can do it wait for a Switch successor.If you are on the edge because you thing Nintendo games are for kids or it looks child it's or something, put that aside and have a go.It's like a mix of Fable, Avatar the Last Airbender, it's amazing.

After 7 years and at least 5 years of development, *this* is the progress that's made?It's a shameless Breath of the Wild DLC that masquerades as a sequel because of a "unique" mechanic (popularized by better games more than a decade ago) and a slightly expanded world to explore in the sky.I was expecting a sequel similar to Majora's Mask, where the same assets are used but the story, the world, most of the characters, many of the enemies, are new. That is not what you'll get with this game. Breath of the Wild was impactful because of the novelty of being the first of its kind in the Zelda franchise - Tears of the Kingdom absolutely lacks this freshness.Don't bother. Just okay Breath of the Wild again.;5/10;22 May 2023;17 out of 65 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Great;This game is a really good follow up to breath of the wild, and it improves upon many of the things that made that game worse. First, I'm going to talk about the positives. Firstly, the game runs pretty well on the switch, with only a few frame drops here and there. The enemy variety is also better than breath of the wild, and there are tons of new areas to explore in the almost tripled in size world map. Also, all the new abilities are great, and really fun to experiment with. In my opinion, they're better than breath of the wild's runes. Now for the negatives. The dungeons are pretty short, they're not bad, just kind of short. Also, this is my biggest problem with the game, pretty much all the enemies one or two shot you even if you have a lot of health. That is really annoying because if you are doing well in a fight, then all of a sudden the enemy just one shots you, it's gonna take a lot of the fun out of combat. Overall, the game is great and a solid 9/10.;9/10;2 June 2023;4 out of 7 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Game of the century;I have played many year over the years from god of war to grand theft auto.

Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;In my opinion, the best game I've ever played;I don't have words to express my feelings about this game. If you haven't played it yet, I don't know what are you doing here, GO PLAY IT NOW.This game improves every single aspect of its predecessor,and,even with the same console, nintendo managed to expand the world they already mastered 6 years ago, giving this game his own personality and look, mantaining some mechanics and ways to play from BOTW.The story undergoes an extraordinary upgrade from its prequel, going through its captivating development, immersive storytelling, and emotionally charged epic finale that evokes a plethora of sensations, leaving you moved and with no words. If you're a fan of open-world adventure games, this is an absolute must-play.Story: 10/10 Sound:10/10 Music: 10/10 Graphics: 8.0/10 (PC: 10/10) Art Design: 10/10 Level Design: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Immersion 10/10Overall: 10/10.;10/10;28 May 2023;5 out of 11 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Magnum Opus of Gaming;This yet another magnum opus from Nintendo. Breath of the Wild came and completely changed the way we gamers viewed and played open-world games. Now after 6 years, Tears of the Kingdom shows how Nintendo still had a lot of innovative ideas in the minds to improve the experience even further, a feat I didn't think was possible. So many new and incredible gameplay mechanics are introduced here which I haven't seen in any other game I've ever played. I would go on to say these gameplay mechanics are the most innovative and creative. They completely changed the way players will experience Hyrule again. The Hyrule itself although similar is quite different than before. We have the new Sky and Underground maps now that makes the exploration even more worthwhile. One thing I also appreciate about its gameplay is how it allows freedom but also test the player's creativity and problem-solving skills like no other. Having many tools at the disposal means nothing if the players can't exploit them according to their creativity and not something that was scripted by the developers. The physics engine in this game is also the best i've ever seen with Red Dead Redemption 2's physics engine at close second place. This time the game has a heavy emphasis on story, and the plot is very interesting with proper voice acting. There are also dungeons in this one for those missing them in Breath of the Wild. Last but not the least, the graphics although not ground-breaking by today's standard, are still very artistic. In fact, it looks and feels like a Studio Ghibli movie. Due to this art-style, this game will still look gorgeous even after 25 years whereas most photorealistic game of today will probably not age well in comparison. We've seen this in case of Wind Waker, which is a timeless piece of joyful art. In comparison Mass Effect, which came a few years later hasn't aged that well in looks department. Although, I do admit that there are a few performance drops in some instances due to Switch's hardware limitations. I believe this should have been a launch title for the Switch 2 and as a result should've made use of improved specification to run smoother and looked better. Nevertheless, the questions is that do I like it more than Breath of the Wild? Well, in some cases yes and in some cases no. Yes because it's clearly a more grander experience with vastly larger map, better gameplay mechanics and better story. But it doesn't compare with the experience of discovering Hyrule for the first time in Breath of the Wild. Although by comparison the experience of Breath of the Wild was a lot simpler. but that was where the true beauty of Breath of the Wild really was. It was after a very long time that I had some much fun, and a sense of nostalgic escapism. or maybe, feeling like a kid again playing a video-game. Nintendo clearly knows how to make the most memorable and joyful video-game experiences, and this alongside Breath of the Wild ranks topmost in my absolute best game of all time.;10/10;9 August 2023;2 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Heckin yes;Breath of the Wild who? Lol, Breath of the Wild was OK compared to this game. Tears of the Kingdom improved on just about EVERYTHING. This game is iconic. So many people are doing so many crazy things with this game. It's insane.When I first saw people strapping rockets to little Koroks, I knew this game was about to pop off. And pop off it DID. We are probably going to get another solid 6 years of ridiculous things that people are building. Hopefully we can share schematics in the future. I've seen Star Wars ships, life size beyblade, gigantic eagle wings fused together with cannons attacking poor little bokoblins below.Poor bokoblins!! So much torture. I saw someone say Zelda's gonna have to get Ganondorf's help to stop Link! Lol.;10/10;18 June 2023;2 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;The Adventure Of A Lifetime;This is hands down and without a doubt the greatest game ever made. Everything is bigger and better including Hyrule. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking. The characters and monsters are very creative. The gameplay is on point. The story is interesting. The music is fantastic. There are abilities like fusing weapons and levitating objects. You can even teleport to different areas. You can collect horses and ride them to your heart's content. The side quests are so much fun and there are plenty of them. I am a huge Zelda fan ever since the original and this game blows them all away. The beautiful magic of the Zelda saga continues and I hope it never ends.;10/10;11 July 2023;2 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Rose Colored Glasses;I'll keep this short and sweet: the game is good. People saying this is some innovative masterpiece don't have a clue what they're talking about.TotK was originally DLC for BotW before they realized they had enough content to make a new title. That's fair and all, but that's exactly how this game plays and what it feels like: BotW 1.5. If you never beat BotW, then maybe this won't feel so trying. If you DID beat BotW, playing TotK can feel more like a chore than a world worth exploring... because you already explored it.There are 2 things that are different: Crafting/Fusing and Sky Islands/Underworld. Crafting is fine, but tedious, and other games have similar mechanics that work way more efficiently. Sky islands are intriguing initially but feels a little undercooked and barely warranted the new Zelda title. The underworld is just the reverse of the mainland, and it's daunting at first, until you realize it's actually boring to explore and takes up the entire size of the original game. There's so much fat they could have trimmed. Seriously.The story is more immersive than BotW, I'll give it that for sure. Enemies are harder imo, but the game just doesnt play as well and the controls are more counterintuitive than ever before, effectively providing more challenge than the enemies do. Maybe it's a skill issue, I'm open to that, but I've played games my whole life and I've never gotten entirely comfortable playing TotK. It barely runs at 30 fps half the time which is just insane in 2023.It sounds like I'm harping on it, but it's just not a perfect game. It doesn't feel as dense and whole as BotW did, and it feels like something crucial is missing. like it's lacking heart and soul.If this was any other game it would receive okay to decent reviews, but because it's Zelda everyone votes it as a 10. Just take the rose colored glasses off before you play the game.;6/10;6 July 2023;4 out of 10 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;Most overrated "Zelda" of all time.;This game isn't a bad game but in my eyes it's not a zelda game. The game has zero structure, no main theme music as you explore about, and you can simply just cheat through all of the puzzles and dungeons with ease. This game only deepens that ability after breath of the wild. The dungeons are lack luster, the koraks are pointless and annoying, the sages constantly follow you around (you can't put them away and their ai constantly blocks your view) as you progress and ruin stealth by the simple accidental tap of the a button. The world is the same as breath of the wild with a touch of DLC to it, not to mention the melodramatic cutscenes and anime style voice-acting all adds up to a cheap ninja gaiden feel. If I were to compare this to any previous zelda title it would be one above zelda for the Phillips CDI. Mechanically speaking previous zelda games had better design and going back and playing those games makes me realise how woefully simple totk is. There's a certain person that likes an "open world game" as to where I just prefer a "zelda game". I feel that fallout and skyrim fans will enjoy this game. Totk is still fun, but to me it's far from the definition of a zelda game and that's where this game frustrates me the most. 4/10.;4/10;17 May 2023;17 out of 81 found this helpful.
Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom;I Didn't expect this to be at this level wow!!!;At first i just thinkt it would be worse than note and just a copy and i didn't like the fush thing in the trailer but in the game it was just fun so creative and good i belive this will win game awards this year to. I never get bored of this game it's just fantastic you can always do something in this game that is why this so good even if i like prefere the old game more is this at the same level. The only complain i have is the voice acting it's not so good and the voices doesn't fit the character att all but that isn't a big deal for me and it doesn't change my 10/10. I recommend this game to everyone because this game fits the most!;10/10;4 June 2023;2 out of 5 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Metroid Dread;My favorite game of all time.;Dread has most fluid gameplay and fast paced gameplay of every game I've played. Puzzle elements are nice and simple, this game is linear without it being linear. There are no points of the game where I felt extremely lost. If there is one gripe I have with the game is that the E. M. M. I are very good at killing you. The E. M. M. I sections are a bit too frequent but not by much. I would recommend this game to anyone, just make sure that you don't have anxiety or scare easily.;10/10;29 October 2021;6 out of 6 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Metroid Dread;One of my favorite games!;Metroid has always been my favorite video game franchise. I was happy when Metroid Prime 4 was announced, and was hoping for an update this past E3. I forgot to be disappointed when there was no new Prime news, because Dread was announced! I LOVED this game! I am not the best at games, but I have always loved the challenges the Metroid franchise provides. It pushes me to be better. Dread is a hard game, but with practice anyone can figure it out! I love the art design, and the story. The music was good for atmosphere, though forgettable. All in all this is one of my favorite games of all time! Worth the wait, and the price tag!I will see the story is at its best if you have at least played Super Metroid, and Metroid Fusion. Though you can probably just watch a quick story break down online prior. While the story recap at the beginning of the game was informative, it didn't capture the emotion of the story in my opinion.;10/10;14 October 2021;6 out of 6 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Metroid Dread;Would likely rate a 9.5 but will round up for the obvious passion behind the product.;Amazing game start to finish. The exploration, the mechanics and boss fights. If there would be two critiques the first would be to improve the soundtrack, it was a common critique I had with Samus Returns, the remakes of previous metroid songs are excellent but new material lacks the same emotion as previous entries. But where they may dip a bit in sound they exceed in graphics and mechanics. Both Samus Returns and Dread feature stunning attention to detail in environments and bosses are mechanically brilliant both games featured some of my most memorable boss encounters. though my favorite franchise boss would still be quadraxis from Metroid Prime 2. I'd say give this game a try you will get frustrated at times but this is matched or exceeded by the feeling of victory when you master the encounter.;10/10;12 October 2021;6 out of 6 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Metroid Dread;My 2021 Game of the Year!;The only adventure I've gone through with Samus was Super Metroid and I greatly enjoyed it. However I was immediately dethroned for me by Metroid Dread. The visuals are positively stunning, the bosses and enemies are a tough challenge, the secrets you can find in every corner are rewarding and give you a sense of accomplishment and power, the music is brilliantly done, the game is (for the average player) around 8-11 hours long which means when you master it you can breeze through it in a few hours. This narrowly claimed my game of the year (with Halo Infinite being nearly, nearly as good of a game) but honestly, it deserves it and I am patiently (not really though) awaiting for Metroid Prime 4... I'll just have to wait about six years, but it'll be fine!;10/10;19 February 2022;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Metroid Dread;A Fantastic Return;After 19 long years, Metroid Dread has finally arrived, and it's everything fans of Samus Aran's 2D adventures could have wanted. Excellent controls, phenomenal visuals, and an interesting story combine to make a challenging, but rewarding package. 19 years was a long time to wait, but this title is good enough that it almost makes up for that.;10/10;13 October 2021;8 out of 10 found this helpful.
Nintendo;Metroid Dread;Good action game, okay Metroid game;Metroid Dread is an extremely fun action adventure game, with fluid combat and snappy movement. Beams are fun to use with the 360-degree aiming. The slide move is a welcome addition that keeps the momentum going. The bosses are challenging but satisfying to beat. They require you to learn the pattern, and master the fight. But it is slightly disappointing as a Metroid game. Notably, the atmosphere is not very prevalent. I wasn't as immersed in the world, and the soundtrack was less memorable (though it did grow on me). Areas were more distinct and interesting looking than Samus Returns, with good variety, but I just wasn't immersed like the other games. The counter indicator and constant (loud) combat with smaller enemies took the focus away from exploring an alien world. I felt that there weren't as many moments with a moody, oppressive atmosphere that I just wanted to soak in. The game is also fairly linear, even though it takes you through many different areas. You go on a relatively straight path, with little option to do another area first (like in Super Metroid). This could've worked if the game had a more intricate story (like in Metroid Fusion), but there isn't much of one to be found. However, the planet is still extremely fun to explore, thanks to items being placed in every nook and cranny. With fun puzzles to solve to get them. The speed booster in particular had lots of satisfying item puzzles, that took advantage of the movement. The power-ups were all useful, and fun to use. It might be a nitpick, but the graphics look sort of plasticy, and the art style is less grimy and detailed than say, the Metroid Prime games (which were also 3D, on notably less powerful hardware). The backgrounds do look phenomenal, and there's plenty to see, but I felt like the character models could've looked a little bit better. I prefer Metroid to have disgusting, scary looking enemies, but I felt like there was a little bit of missed potential for that here (though that's definitely a nitpick). The EMMI sections were satisfying, and intense. The fights with the robots were especially engaging (partially because of the dynamic camera angle). However, they certainly didn't build much dread, and didn't have as oppressive of an atmosphere as I would've liked. They stay the same throughout the whole game, with little variation to keep you on your toes (to be fair, each one uses a different power-up). They always stay within their zone (which all look the same), and they all have pretty much the same design (just with different colors). Compare this to the SA-X in Metroid Fusion, which showed up unexpectedly (on a first playthrough), in various environments, and you didn't know when it would appear next. I felt that there was a missed potential to really play into that "dread" the game is named after. What if one of the EMMI broke out of its zone unexpectedly, or were infused with the X and took on a more disturbing design? I just felt that there could've been more surprises with them. Though again, I have to admit they were fun, just not "dread" inducing. Bringing up the story again, I felt that it was less impactful then the two previous numbered entries. The cutscenes were very well choreographed, had lots of personality, and we're action packed. But there wasn't much of a narrative, even compared to Super Metroid (which was on the SNES). There were twists to be sure, but nothing was built up. Some new characters were introduced, but they barely interact with Samus, or offer much personality. Even the mandatory sections were Samus must talk to Adam, offer little in the way of character interaction, or expand on the world. The dialogue between Adam and Samus is missing the personality and charm that Fusion had, though to be fair, there is technically a reason for that (if you've beaten the game, you know what I mean). I also think 1-2 text based monologues (like Fusion), would've been decent here, since Samus is seeing the race that raised her, unexpected alive and well. I would've liked to hear a tiny bit of her thoughts. Though definitely not like in Other M. But overall, nitpicks aside, this is still a great game, and I'm glad Metroid is back. It was extremely satisfying to play. I just hope the next entry, will be slightly more atmospheric, than this one.;8/10;5 March 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;There Is No Other Choice;This game has gotten way too much critisism for the decisions that the creators made. Even when this came out, I strongly disagreed with some of the critisism, because I felt people misunderstood the plot and the motives of the characters. Now that I'm playing the game for the second time and I can kind of relax, knowing how the story goes, I can focus more on how the story and the characters proceed, and the game is still amazing. It looks amazing and I love the characters because they seem like real people. Real people do things wrong, they are not perfect.I feel like haters just concentrated on what happens to Joel. But the game shows that everything has consequences, even for the characters that everybody adores. If you cannot handle that, you should never watch movies, read books or play games, because it happens in every form of media. People that are loved, suffer or die. That is just life.I have no other choice but to give this a 10/10. I'm having so much fun and I'm excited to see pt III.;10/10;18 March 2023;76 out of 114 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;Masterpiece at so many levels;I simply can't understand all the disappointed low reviews.

No other game had ever made me throw the control away because I simply couldn't decide which character to hurt. And that's the whole point: this game makes us question violence in games and the futility of violence in general as a response to conflict. If nothing else, just for that, it deserves every recognition in the world.The way it introduces the different characters and makes you realise that your antagonist may be someone else's protagonist, is flawless.The characters are full of life and truth. They're believable and 3D, not flat archetypes.I could go on and on. And I genuinely feel sorry for those who feel disappointed by this game.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;Sad story isn't bad story. This not what you wanted, but it what you got!;Story is not stupid. It is horribly sad. It develops around the theme of neverending violence, and how it destroys us in the end. A really needed perspective, a thing, that we all need to hear in todays world.I have to say, that one of the best things is, that this story doesnt give a **** about you. It develops in its own way. Yes, at the end you might wish you didnt play it and just stick with ending of first part, but isn't it what life really is about? Us remebering the good old days? Horrified what might future do to us? And is it really up to us to stop that wheel of violence? Or are we just trapped inside its never ending cycle?These and other thoughts I have during gameplay. So it is thought-provoking, which is great and beyond what ou expect from game story.One star down for unnecessary double ending.As for the graphics design, combat modes and atmosphere, it is totally fantastic.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;Flawed but definitely had it's moments;Now i do understand what most of you think about this game because of what druckman did, that he ruined the original characters and he prefers that you hate his game rather than feeling nothing about it and tbh me too was really upset and disappointed after you know 2 hours into the game "the thing" happened but if you actually continue to play the game it all make sense and it's not like you are not getting any Joel and Ellie moment, you should know that Joel in the first game did a lot of messed up things with no mercy even if it was out of love and his past is coming to hunt him in this game which was always the case, he's not a hero guys even if you want him to be.The graphics and environments are breathtaking, some of the best world design i've ever seen and the gameplay while similar to the original, it's even more violent, horrifying and gruesome as it can get.In terms of story i still think the original is told better because literally every character in the original last of us was likeable even the villains and that's not the case here, Abby is incredibly unlikable and she had no redeeming qualities to me if Lev didn't exist, Dina and Jessie are alright but they should have been way better and the pacing is all over the place but even so, this is a quality game and it's nowhere near as bad as some would make you believe and most of them didn't even gave the game a chance and made up their minds based on the leaks which works for a movie i guess but this is different and you have to experience it for yourself and even if you still don't like it, it's understandable like i said the game is flawed and it's not for everyone like the first game.;8/10;22 June 2020;323 out of 680 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;Far From Perfect, Far From Garbage. A Flawed Masterpiece.;First thing's first, play the game for yourself. Buy the game, turn the lights off, and get cracking. In the end, this is a video game, and the only thing that matters is your own personal experience. You might hate it, you might love it, but it's your opinion, and nobody should be able to change that. I have played all the way through the game, and I took my sweet time. What follows are my honest opinions:The Gameplay: Putting everything from the story to one side, this is stellar, top class gameplay. Combat is fluid, tense, and really exhausting in the best possible of ways. It takes everything we loved from the first game and only builds on it. You're able to approach encounters however you please, but playing smart (using stealth and your tools) feels immensely rewarding. I thoroughly enjoyed scavenging for materials and planning ahead to decide how I could be the most effective predator in combat while utilising as little resources as possible. Whether you're up against human foes, or the infected (Including the absolutely terrifying new infected types!) it's up to you as the player to determine how you can be the most effective against each very different enemy type. This is a true post-apocalypse experience.The Story: It's extremely difficult to talk about the narrative, for many reasons. First and foremost, spoilers. (I won't be spoiling anything!) Reading the leaks and not playing the game will not give you the faintest idea of the direction this story takes. It's a video game, and it must therefore be played in full, by you. In my opinion, the story is truly complex and multi layered. Sometimes you want to cry, sometimes you want to laugh, sometimes you want to throw your controller through the TV. There's a lot at work here, and my understanding is that most of these emotions you feel are intentional. There are points in the game where you will NOT be satisfied with the outcomes of events, and this is the way it's designed. This is a story about the cost of revenge, sins of the father, and the near impossible ability to swallow hatred. The game is a message, and only by playing through the entire story could I piece together -and comprehend- the message I was being taught.But given this, I believed the story was far too long, with some really odd and dissatisfying decisions mixed in. There's a particular sequence of the game that has you go back in time to relive events from a new perspective. There are moments here that are crucial to the overall narrative arc and your understanding of the plot, but it turns into a 10+ hour deviation. I found myself wanting to get back to "the game" as if I was playing something completely different. The game lost it's flow for me here, and I began to feel disconnected from all of the characters on-screen. There are moments (that I can't go into) Where the game wanted me to perform actions that I simply did not want to perform. This did not feel intentional to me, all I was feeling in these particular moments was confusion and disappointment. But, the final hour brings it all back together, and finally concludes what the game is setting out to say in a really intelligent and hard hitting way. I am likely to carry these feelings for years to come!In conclusion, I saw this as a heavily flawed masterpiece. It added upon things I loved about the first game, and it took away things I loved about the first game. It was an exhausting journey through just about every emotion a person can feel. It was incredibly intelligent, well constructed, and beautifully rendered. I often found myself admiring random, totally unimportant spots in the game world, considering just how much work had gone into creating such gorgeous environments. But it's far from perfect, the concept of "If you don't like it, you don't get it" is preposterous, nobody can tell you how to feel. You are perfectly in your right to dislike this game, but only once you have played it for yourself.;7/10;5 July 2020;317 out of 583 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;Good gameplay ruined by awful writing!;I was a huge fan of the original game. It was one of the best stories I've ever experienced so you can imagine my disappointment when hopping into this game. First of all, the main characters of the first game are completely butchered by stupid writing. Everything from, trying to avoid spoilers, traditionally careful and experienced characters who've shown in the first game that they know how dangerous strangers can be and to not trust anyone but in this game they're now automatically trusting of people they've never met to go as far as to even tell them they're names and where their settlement is within 4 minutes of meeting them.That's just one example of the poor writing in this game and trust me when I say there's plenty more to complain about but to avoid spoiling anything I'll just say the game makes bold decisions in its story. The problem is the execution was done so poorly as it obviously was trying to be bold for the sake of being bold and ignoring good story telling. I recommend you pass on this. If you're a fan of the first game, just pretend this game never came out. You'll be far happier with the bittersweet ending of the first game and believing that to be the definitive ending to Joel and Ellie's story.;4/10;24 November 2021;25 out of 34 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;Sometimes brilliance is misunderstood.;Finished The Last of Us Part II and started Survival+. Blew me away! The editing in this game is beyond impressive. It reminds me of the editing in Pulp Fiction, which took some people time to get used to. Now, this kind of editing is common in cinema, but to have it in a game is really impressive. I gotta say, I was expecting a bad ending, too but was pleasantly surprised. Technically and gameplay wise it is the best 3rd person shooter I've ever played and best stealth game, too. Better than the first and my new all time favourite game tied with God of War.This game and the first have been given different themes. The first was, 'The journey, companionship, fate and destiny', while Part 2's themes are, 'vengeance and the cycle of violence'. Makes so much sense now, after playing the game in full and seeing how it ends. I'm happy. I definitely would not have had the same experience if I hadn't played the whole game myself and just watched the cut scenes, or watched someone else stream a play through. You slowly grow to feel empathy for Abbey by playing the entire game. This is why I believe some of the haters did not play through the whole game themselves.The people who aren't happy with the story wanted to hate Abbey, but instead were forced to feel empathy for her. Funny, cause if the first part of Abbey's story never happened these haters would have really liked her and not disliked the story.You do not have to like Abbey (I eventually did), but you are meant to feel empathy for her. This is the part some people struggled with. The whole point of the script is to feel empathy for every single human in the game, even the lesser enemies as you kill them. I commend Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann for taking such risks. If they never did what they did with the story we would more than likely have had just another game instead of this masterpiece.;10/10;9 July 2020;212 out of 461 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!;This game is absolutely stunning! So many people have gone into this game believing that they already hate it before even playing.I REFUSED TO LOOK AT ANY LEAKS BEFORE PLAYING AND I LOVED IT!!The story makes sense! Its true, its dark, realistic and its explores so many gritty and real themes. Like it says on the game case, it's a REVENGE story, not another cash-grab sequel. Everything that happens in the story happens for a REASON.This game looks INCREDIBLE! I played this on the original PS4 and it shocked me how polished and beautiful it was. Definitely one of the best looking games out there.The gameplay is very similar to the first game but feels quite a lot more polished. And the game is just so much more brutal than the last.This game is already in the top 5 games on PS4 for me and I will always stand by that.;9/10;19 June 2020;311 out of 691 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;People are being way to critical about this game!;I honestly do not think this game is bad in any way, people are just mad because it wasn't made the way they wanted, and by now it just seems like people love to hate it, which I think is stupid.I gotta admit, this game isn't quite like the first one, and makes you feel a little bit different, which I think is okay since the first game is about love and this is about hate. I can admit that a few things (not many) was indeed a little bit dumb, but overall this game has great graphics, great gameplay and a good story, and I do think people should try to play it themselves, cause you do get invested in the story, and it's a great journey.I think the characters are likeable also, which is good. I even startet to like some of the "bad" ones too, which I didn't like that I did, but is a good thing.I personally think it's worth your money, give the game a shot.;10/10;19 June 2020;270 out of 603 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;Epic, complex, technically outstanding and not "by the a book" sequel;Greetings from Lithuania.I was really looking forward for "The Last of Us: Part II" (2020) because I've completed first game three times and it is one of my favorite, if not my favorite game of all time. I watched main trailer many times, avoided all leaks on internet and even did not watched demo of Part II - i wanted to come to this game as "empty" as possible, so all the twists were truly unexpected for me - did not see that coming. And after ~34 hours that took me to complete the story (because i took a time to explore this world little by little) i can safely say - this is a great game to say the least despite its flaws.By flaws i mean that it was a bit to long in my opinion - some of the stuff later in the game could have been cut out - playing it felt more like a "directors cut" were they put all scenes possible to enrich this world. Also this game had some pacing issues later in the game, were it dragged a bit here and there. And those were my only complains. Other than that this is hand down one of the very best if not the best PS4 title ever made.If you liked exploration of this bleak world in the first game - you will more then like this. Graphics, sound, music. controls - all were first rate. Acting was very good as well. There were a lot of very intense action set pieces, were i was fighting bunch of enemies using all possible "tools" that game gave me - i can't even describe it - it has to be played to truly be experienced it. I also like how brutal and bleak this world is, were many of good characters that i encountered died suddenly and without any warning - it felt like a real world. And the story took me to places i surely did not be seeing in this game - there were many surprises along the way.Overall, creators of this game surely took a risk with plot, and as it can be seen now, many did not like it. I liked it because it felt fresh and took a different direction then one can expect from a sequel. "The Last of Us: Part II" is epic, bold, unique and technically amazingly game which despite its flaws ranks among the best games on PS4, and i think one of the more unique sequels ever made on any media.;10/10;24 June 2020;127 out of 294 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;The Last of Us Part II;As a fan, I'm just sad.;As a fan of the first game, I was absolutely HYPED for this game. When The Last of Us 2 opens up, you get a beautiful world, familiar soundtrack, and the return of both of the characters we all grew to love in the first game, Joel and Ellie. For the first 2 hours of gameplay, you feel right at home in the world. But it soon begins to fall apart. It is hard for someone who has replayed the first game multiple times to realize that the sequel is not up to par. TLOU is about characters and story. Many people, myself included, did not play the game for the gameplay, which is just like a lot of other games. It was the story and the chemistry between Joel and Ellie as a father-daughter duo that drew us all in. Part two feels like it completely disregards the relationship established in the first and the characters seem to change personality and consistency just to further the plot along. There are times where the characters feel like a different character entirely and I was left thinking, "(insert character name) wouldn't have done that. They were smarter than that."After about 7 hours of gameplay, it begins to feel flat. In a world full of undead, even the living lose life. The story becomes cliche and predictable, and there is a section that is about 10 hours long that focuses on things that have nothing to do with the main story except that it is trying to establish a backstory for a new character. In the first game you learned about the characters as they pushed through the story, a 10 hour flashback was not needed to establish the characters. A lot of the times, things were just unnecessary and by the halfway point I was just wanting it to be over because I was just bored.Boring is not a word I would like to use to describe The Last of Us 2, but it is what it is.The ending is anticlimactic and it feels as if the game was trying too hard to be artsy and deep instead of just telling a good story. I felt so much emotion for these characters in the first game, and to this day I can't get through the prologue without crying, but I felt nothing in part 2. The characters feel so different and inconsistent that if it weren't for the fact that clickers were present, you could easily forget that this is even a TLOU game.All that said, the graphics, soundtrack, and acting are phenomenal. The story, is flat and feels more dead than the undead themselves.This game is definitely getting bombed by negative reviews on purpose, but don't just ignore the audience score because of that because there are some valid reasons for disliking this game.;5/10;19 June 2020;763 out of 1,370 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;Ghost of Tsushima;Best Game of 2020;This game is almost perfection-- everything from the ultra-realistic renderings of Japan to the combat to the acting is incredible. I also love the story and Jin's conflicted nature about the rogue element of his combat style.The main villains' barbarity was portrayed well. In one of my favorite games, Medieval Total War 2, and during the Medieval era the Mongols were the most ruthless enemies you could battle. Historically, they were such an existential threat that warring provinces in Eastern Europe called a truce with each other and banded together to drive them back to Asia.People have complained about this game's repetitiveness. Yes, sometimes the combat is somewhat repetitive, but to me it's the GOOD kind of repetitive. I'm not annoyed by it.Whenever I want to complete every task in a game you know that it has attained legendary status. I posted a "top twenty video games" list on my blog last year with games that ranged from the '80s to today. Now I want to revise it to include Ghost on it.;10/10;6 October 2020;99 out of 101 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;Ghost of Tsushima;Man or ghost?;'Ghost Of Tsushima (2020)' is an open-world adventure game set during the Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274. It's essentially historical fiction, spinning off from an authentic starting point to tell its own tale. That tale focuses on Jin, one of the few remaining samurai after an initial battle on the beach, as he fights to regain his strength and, using tactics he normally would never consider and allies who previously might've spat in his face, reclaim his island. The narrative deals with resonant themes of honour, sacrifice and family. It's really engaging, enjoyable and, at times, emotional, too. It ties itself into the fundamental design of the game in an incredibly intrinsic way, which means that everything you do - from the main missions to the side content - actually feels as though it's moving towards a single, inevitable stopping point. Basically, this means that nothing seems like busy work and that you'll actually want to participate in the non-mandatory stuff because it all adds up to a more complete, cohesive and thematically rich experience. It feels like a proper samurai story, clearly inspired by Japanese Jidaigeki (period drama) and Chanbara (sword fighting) films (and, in particular, the work of Akira Kurosawa). It feels remarkably authentic, despite the fact that it obviously takes some liberties when it comes to accuracy (the katana wasn't invented until well after the plot's events, for example), and is possibly the best representation of East Asian culture I've seen in a western game. For added immersion, I recommend you play through the title in Japanese with subtitles. The Japanese voice acting is very good and, though the character's mouths don't line up with the non-English dialogue (which is getting 'fixed' in the upcoming director's cut), the title almost feels designed to have been played using it right from the start. it's no botched dub, that's for sure. The gameplay is basically a mixture of combat, stealth and exploration. It's all really fun. The combat is highly satisfying and totally avoids feeling like a 'button mash' sort of thing. You have to consider your blows and be ready to dodge or parry at a moment's notice. As the game progresses, the fighting evolves to include multiple enemy types, sword stances, ranged weapons, ammo types and special abilities, all of which have distinct effects and enable you to adjust the way you want to take on your foes. The title's duelling mechanic, which pops up ever so often when you face a more substantial enemy than your standard Mongol soldier, puts the focus firmly back on skill-based swordplay (your secondary weapons can't be used) and does a good job of emulating the showdowns seen in samurai media. These mastery-testing one-on-one battles are actually some of the most intense in the game, partly due to their difficulty and partly due to the fact that they're often directly fuelled by the story. The combat in general is really fun and is potentially the highlight of the game. The stealth is a bit more basic than the out-in-the-open combat. it's primarily line-of-sight based stuff. Still, it's challenging enough to be rewarding when you remain undetected. You can hide among tall grass or use high ground to your advantage, use your bows to pick off foes or get up close and slip your tanto in-between their ribs, throw a wind chime as a distraction or cause panic with your poison. There are plenty of options and if you're seen you can usually just engage the enemy in a more traditional manner (though some missions do require stealth to succeed). Exploration is perhaps what you spend most time doing. Between main missions, you're left on your own - with your trusty steed, that is - to roam around Tsushima and discover what it has to offer. Be it fox dens, Inari shrines, bamboo strikes, pillars of honour, Sashimono banners, Torii shrines or haiku spots (my favourite collectible type), there are plenty of things to find as you ride around. What's especially nice is that each of them reward you with something that has a tangible impact on either gameplay (charms can be used to augment certain behind-the-scenes statistics, for example) or Jin's appearance, meaning that finding them never feels like a chore. The other two types of collectible, records and artefacts, aren't as compelling to find, but they still provide some solid background story / information and prove that Sucker Punch have done their research. Traversal is always intuitive, though slightly floaty, and there is a good balance between moments of peace and Mongol patrols that need your attention. A large part of the game is liberating settlements of various sizes which have been captured by the enemy. Some of these require you to kill everyone inside, some require you to save hostages and some require you to complete a series of bespoke objectives. Whatever the case, they're always entertaining and - much like the experience in general - never get repetitive. Throughout your journey, you will find materials that can be taken to various smiths and merchants to upgrade your gear. This progression system is very linear but, because you have a variety of armours to choose between (each of which have their own distinct benefits), there is an element of resource allocation that keeps you on your toes. The skill-based progression isn't as linear. you gain skill points for increasing your legend (earned by completing missions and taking on enemies), which you can then trade for an assortment of stance, tactic, weapon and exploration enhancements. It's possible to gain every skill before the end of the game, so the levelling up system is more about choosing what you want to upgrade first rather than choosing between two contradicting skills. That's not a bad thing, though, as it allows you to feel truly powerful as the experience draws to its close - if you've mastered your newfound abilities and equipment, that is. Alongside the main missions and more general open-world elements (such as liberations), the game offers three kinds of side missions. The first are a series of varied, character-specific stories that further explore five key characters to give them some welcome depth. The second are one-off stories that often act as small morality plays and are interesting despite their meat-and-potatoes usually just being "go here and kill these guys". The last are known as 'mythic tales' and explore modern-day remnants of ancient legends, ultimately rewarding you with a new piece of gear or a special ability. They arguably have the most substantial rewards and have a distinct, often almost otherworldly feel to them. It's also worth mentioning that the title introduced a co-operative mode in a post-launch update, but I don't have any experience with it so I won't discuss it further. Graphically, the game is really impressive. Its world is colourful, varied and sprinkled with prime opportunities to use photo mode. A stand-out element is certainly its particle system, which can see seemingly thousands of cherry blossom leaves swirl around your feet or paint the scenery red with accurate arterial spray from your enemies. It's spectacular stuff. The animation is great, too, and the cut-scenes are top-notch. Ultimately, 'Ghost Of Tsushima (2020)' is a phenomenal open-world game that somehow avoids the pitfalls of its genre despite playing pretty closely by its rules. It has an excellent story that's surprisingly affecting, highly enjoyable gameplay and a sometimes downright beautiful aesthetic. 10/10.;10/10;9 July 2021;10 out of 10 found this helpful.

You can't go wrong with buying this game. I play on easy mode, and I experienced something VERY rare in a video game. Even on easy mode, it's still beautifully balanced and not TOO easy to where it's not enjoyable. And the side quests actually build the characters, it's not like (my personal favorite open world game) Horizon Zero dawn, where you do the side quests and that's it. You did a service for the characters and you never have any idea what it had to do with the stories. None of that on here, it all seems to tie in with the story. This game is emotional, there were a few times where I felt like I was punched in the gut with my own feelings. Should I even say more?

Sony Interactive Entertainment;Ghost of Tsushima;A tribute to the beauty of a whole generation;Ghost of Tsushima, the last big Playstation 4 exclusive pushes the consoles hardware limits beyond the horizon while tributing this legendary console generation a cinematographic masterpiece.The gameolay of Ghost of Tsushima is fantastic. The katana feels real with all the different stances and attack combinations it gives you the freedom to decide on your own which kind of samurai you want to be. This supported with the bow, that feels incredible on the new dualsense by the way, and the ghost weapons makes the combat system nearly perfect.The story of the game is great aswell. Following the main storyline you will encounter well placed plottwists and a brilliantly crafted emotional end. The side quests often are different but unfortunately some are repetitious. Nevertheless the tales of your allies were pretty great to follow.Open world is well designed, you have countless things to do. Especially in the beginning you feel very excited to discover all the things you can do. Unfortunately there are a little bit too much of the same activities in the game. Like 49 fox dens which are 49 times the same thing. This has been done to extend the games playtime. But that's a general problem of modern videogames.What this game does great is how you are led through the open world. You do not have a marker that shows you where to go like we are used to from Ubisoft's games. No, the wind shows you the way. This is an fantastic idea because it works perfect and does not overload your HUD. I loved it and hope that more games will implement something like this.So let's turn to the definitely best aspect of this game: CINEMATOGRAPHYRight from the beginning I was stunned of this games graphics. Definitely highest standard on PS4 and even better on my PS5. The leaves blown by the wind, the grass, the water all looks just perfect. There is no way to top this quality! I think they finally reached the limit in terms of graphics. The whole story feels like a big budget movie because they have scenes where they mastered camera work. For example during dialogues, the cameras angle changes which creates breathtaking pictures. This masterclass work concludes in the finale where we get one of the most beatiful shots ever.To summarize that, Ghost of Tsushima has a great story, brilliant gameplay and PERFECT cinematography. This makes the game to a MUST PLAY.;7/10;3 March 2023;3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;Ghost of Tsushima;A little of every game in the best way possible;I've played every new release as it comes out for years and this is the most fun I've had in a story driven single player experience for a while. You will see many people comparing it to other titles and they have the right to. When it comes to some mechanics and features, it obviously draws inspiration form other games. However, it does a perfect job of doing so. The stealth/assassinations are satisfying, the crafting system is easy and intuitive, the combat only gets better as the game goes on, and the customization is amazing while staying true to ancient Japanese culture. I've played through the main storyline which at times was tear jerking, yet action packed. Definitely one of those games that makes you feel like the star of a movie. Not to mention feeling like a hero among the people the more your legend grows. All around this game is worth a try. Don't let its comparison to assassins creed make you avoid it. It was a fresh experience through and through and I loved every second of it. Now we just need story expansions or something!;10/10;21 July 2020;9 out of 10 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;Ghost of Tsushima;The newest Akira Kurosawa movie in the form of a video game;So, last of us part 2 left PlayStation players divided. So let's hope sucker punch can close out the PS4 in the same great way they started it with Infamous Second Son (that's actually really poetic👏) I LOVED this game (I have been having a blast playing this game the past few days) set in 1274 on the Island of Tsushima in Japan, you play as Jim Sakai a samurai who is one of the sole survivors of a mongol invasion. Now, the honorable ways of the samurai won't be enough to defeat this army and Jin must learn new ways to fight back including the way of the ghost in order to save his island. Let's get into it by starting with the combat which is AMAZING (it's not button mashy and is about studying your opponent and thinking about what move or stance to use like a real samurai and other things like standoffs and duels are so freaking cool) and the story was really investing (I really liked Jin and liked seeing everything he's been taught to believe about honor and combat to be challenged and having to do what he must to save his island) and this game is BEAUTIFUL (not only is the open world great to explore, but this game's graphics are mind blowing great and there's times I'm just staring in awe and some of the landscapes and great detail) and this game definitely feels like a great homage to samurai flicks from the 50s and 60s (Akira Kurosawa's influence is felt throughout this entire game from the gameplay, to duels, to cutscenes, to even a filter you can use called Kurosawa mode which makes the game black and white) my only SMALL issues with the game are with some side stuff and exploration outside the story (a couple side quest are a little boring and sometimes trying to find things to look for in open world aren't that interesting. Most of the time it's really cool and beautiful to look at, but some hidden things are a little lame for me) in the end, this game blew me away that really took me back to classic samurai films by Akira Kurosawa with amazing gameplay, a really good story, a gorgeous open world and a reminder of why I love video games and how much they've evolved into the art form they are and I'm giving it a 9.7 out of 10;10/10;20 July 2020;16 out of 20 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;God of War- The Masterpiece of this Generation;A common term that has been bouncing around Game developers of late has been that single player games are dead and that multiplayer games are the way of the future due to their popularity. God of War came to blow that statement out of the water and it did just that. What I love most about this masterpiece is the people behind it. Within just the first hour of playing you can really tell that the incredible team at Sony Santa Monica poured their hearts into this game. Within a short period of time we are introduced to new and yet familar Kratos and his son Atreus. The combat feels fresh and as fluid as ever. But nothing and I mean NOTHING beats the feeling of throwing the Leviathan (Kratos Axe) for the first time only to recall it and feel a slight rumble in the controller as you catch it makes you feel like you are actually Kratos. The greatest part of this game is getting to watch and experience the relationship between Kratos and Atreus grow and evole into one of the most epic Father/Son stories told of all time. What blew my mind was that a game that has rougly a 20-25 hour story plus with an additional 10-15 hours of side content to tackle is that it is all done in one seemless shot. Thats right no breaks to cutscenes, no loading screens, nothing! Apart from when you die of coarse. I can honestly tell you there were times that I wasnt sure if I was supposed to controll Kratos or if it was a cutscene because they are both as one when it comes to God of War. Even as the end credits roll you are never taken away from the game. That's right it throws you right back into Midguard to finish any unfinished tasks you may need to complete. I have played every entry in the God of War series and I can honestly say this is their greatest one yet. From its gripping and appealing story, incredible scense of immersion to its fluid and addictive combat it is safe to say Sony Santa Monica has officially set the standard of single player games to a whole new level and has changed the way we play games forever. So thank you to everyone at Sony Santa Monica for this incredible experience and I look forward to seeing the next Chapter in the God of War series.;10/10;24 April 2018;113 out of 125 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;Oh Boy!;This is easily the most exciting and emotional God Of War game of the entire saga and it'll definitely go down in history as one of the best video-game franchise revivals of all time.;9/10;31 May 2019;38 out of 41 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;The best God of War game and one of the best games this generation;I have always been a huge fan of the God of War series. I remember when God of War 3 came out and it blew me away. When I played Ascension I realized that I got tired by its gameplay and combat and I wanted something more. Something new, such as a deeper story or a big improvement in the combat and gameplay. God of War (2018) granted my wishes, but went way beyond from what I expected and wished for.God of War (2018) is about Kratos and his son Atreus. Kratos has put his chaotic past behind many years ago and has moved to the world of the Norse Gods to have a family and to live in peace. Kratos and Atreus' intention is to honor his wife/his mom last wish to carry her ashes to the top of the highest mountain in the Nine Realms. I love the dynamic relationship between Kratos and Atreus. Atreus' desire to have a connection with kratos and to prove to him that he is strong and brave enough but struggles very much to just have a normal communication with him, and as for Kratos he tries to teach him discipline and become a great warrior. He cares about Atreus deeply but struggles to show it. Their dialogue interaction was very interesting and never felt off. The story isn't just unexpectedly good for a God of War game but sets the bar for gaming in general. I would say it's up there with games like The Witcher 3, Uncharted 4, The Last of Us and more. I got more what I asked for in terms of story. The story is incredible, touching and emotional and makes you wanna play more and more. As for gameplay and combat it works and is one of the strongest aspects in the game atleast to me. The new take on God of War is very interesting and the combat felt solid and satisfying. Sure, it's not the same hack and slash action as the previous games where you can see Kratos clearly slashing through many enemies around him but this combat felt more intense and strategic. It's a bigger challenge since the camera is right behind Kratos, so being attacked from behind and from the side is common. The axe in this game is probably one of the best weapons I have played with in any game in years. Slicing enemies to enemies with the axe feels amazing, and throwing the axe and calling it back has never stopped being satisfying no matter how many times i have done it. There are skills you are able to learn to learn more movesets with the axe, and abilities and combining those skills in a fight and succeeding makes amazing combos that is just as awesome like the previous games. If not better. Exploration is also a big part in this game where you get to sail a boat and having many different interesting dialogue interactions between characters. The areas are big enough to explore for loot and other needed items. It never felt boring. The crafting and upgrade system in this game works and there will be many times when you have to figure out which armor you want. All the characters in this game are likeable. Even the antagonists, since they are those type of villains that you love to hate. You like to see them on screen but at the same you do not. Supporting characters to Kratos and Atreus kept the game alive too and became comic reliefs which improved the pacing and was refreshing. Kratos' character is way more developed in this game and I have never loved him as much until now, and you get to care about Atreus. Atreus isnt also a bad sidekick character during gameplay either. You get to controll him during combats such as shooting arrows to enemies and it helps ALOT. He is also very good at translating runes, and knows alot of about the mythology which Kratos doesn't. Atreus is very smart and isn't useless by any means. Trust me, the jaw dropping moments are there. Kratos can still kick ass, and the boss fights were intense and incredible. Fighting gods really felt like fighting gods. Side quests or favors are almost on part with side quests from The Witcher 3 where they are long, interesting and almost makes for a good story. The music in this game is amazing and there are still a couple of tracks that are stuck in my head.So in conlusion, this game got an amazing and touching story, great characters and character development, amazing gameplay with satisfying combat, good pacing, great music, a good sense of humor, great side quests, amazing boss fights and jaw dropping moments. This is everything I ever wanted in a game and therefore is a ten. It's a MUST PLAY MASTERPIECE, especially for people that love great stories. Some God of war fans might not like this one as much due to its new take on gameplay and combat but for me it felt refreshing and needed for a franchise like God of War. Especially after Ascension. There are so many surprises in the game which I do not want to spoil. This is by far one of the best games I have played in years. It's up there with The Last of Us, The Witcher 3, Shadow of the Colossus, Uncharted 2 and 4, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in my opinion.Just do yourself a favor and buy this game.;10/10;22 April 2018;60 out of 68 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;It really is that good;How do you have zero loading screens but maintain an awe inspiring level of graphics and a deeply engrossing story? The rendering is something to behold.The combat is superb. There was a part (several tbh) where I thought, this is too good to be true, but it wasn't and I was actually playing it.Santa Monica Studio did an an absolutely incredible job and deserve all the credit that comes their way.;10/10;23 April 2018;36 out of 40 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;To make a game a perfect, no need to innovate new things but to perfect the existing;When i first saw God of war reveal i am disappointed due to the slow pace combat due to the action heavy style in the previous. I thought it went towards the soulsborne series. Today when i got the copy(I preordered it anyway due to love towards the franchise), I thought ill get fights more of survival than action but hell kratos is still kicks ass be it with new AXE or be in bare hands and spartan rage is best among the series. Story wise i have just played two hours so not much to say but the first major boss battle is enough to tell that this game is epic. and kratos with his anger management and saying anger to be controlled looks like he learned the lesson and teaches to the fellow whom it needs most.Overall its a great action game, little early in review but will update this review once i finish the game and as of now its 10/10;10/10;20 April 2018;42 out of 48 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;Beautiful!;I haven't finished the game yet but I've put a good amount of time into it and all I have to say is, "I love this game!" You can really tell every person involved in this game actually took their time to make something this incredible. The game keeps you on your feet 100% of the time, and there's never a dull moment. I'm not exaggerating at all...Though I did not play the other GOW games, I'm still addicted to this game. Get the game and take your time with it.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;Well done Santa Monica studios;Just amazing, I can't explain how good this game is.

It is a masterpiece. I liked the old god of war games but wasn't a huge fan of them but this has totally gripped me to replay kratos's engaging and tragic story. This game is just amazing and I can't wait for what the future entails.;10/10;24 April 2018;17 out of 20 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;A masterful action and story-driven game and one of the best reboots ever;Just platinumed this masterpiece yesterday. A reboot that does what reboots should do - provide a fresh, modern take on a franchise whose formula was getting stale. God of War (2018) not only retains the brutal, high-octane combat and the focus on mythology (this time Norse mythology) but also turns the franchise into an open-linear (bloodborne inspired), narrative-driven experience, which was something I would have never expected from a God of War game. The story finally has maturity and a great understanding of the central character, as well as a compelling father-son relationship that grows in interesting and quite emotional ways, and it was carefully planned out with every action and cinematic created in motion capture and seamlessly blending gameplay with cutscenes, creating a continuous shot story throughout, also with no loading screens ever after booting the game.The gameplay offers more options than ever with more expansive enemy types, badass runic attacks and special moves, as well as the always satisfactory throwing of the axe and pulling it back like I'm Thor. There's a broad skill tree, armor with enchantments that we can use to up our stats (strength, runic, defense, luck, cooldown) and upgrades we can make to pretty much everything we carry, its RPG elements were well placed. The boss fights are perhaps the biggest disappointment compared to the other games, not as epic or cinematic. But the rest of the combat I think it's definitely an improvement.The graphics are the best I've seen on a PS4, especially the character design, Santa Monica has a reputation of pushing the Playstation hardware to the max and this is another great example. There's also interesting end game and side stuff to do, so it wasn't bothersome to get the rest of the trophies (except for one hardcore boss).Overall I feel like this is everything right with modern gaming, it combines all the good stuff that makes a singleplayer story-driven game but without making it too linear or limited, but expansive and always evolving as we go through its ~20-hour story, always with fresh locations, combat moves, puzzles, exploration, characters, story surprises, etc. It plays great, it looks great and it's a step forward in videogame storytelling;10/10;28 April 2018;13 out of 15 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;Sins of the father.;'God Of War (2018)' is the perfect starting point for someone unfamiliar with the franchise, yet it's also a deep, respectful and rather bold sequel to the original series of games. It acts as a sort of 'new chapter' in its protagonists' life, picking up many years after the end of 'God Of War III (2010)' and swapping its mythology from Greek to Norse. The story is a thematically rich, surprisingly resonant look at fatherhood, as its main focus is the relationship between the much mellowed - yet still deadly - Kratos and his young son, Atreus. This dynamic is one of the most rounded and believable to ever be featured in a game, as it evolves naturally over the course of the narrative and has distinct ramifications on the gameplay itself. You really care for Kratos here, which is something that hasn't been entirely possible before. He is a much more mature person, still haunted by his past, and he has something actually worth fighting for. The game goes out of its way to communicate that vengeance is a path to nothing other than self-destruction, with Kratos having to teach his son how to be better than the Gods that came before him. It's really quite moving at times and it's incredibly gripping. It's also amazingly mature, as the stoic spartan must shed the painful toxic masculinity imposed on him by his culture in order to raise his son and spare him a similarly disastrous fate. As you can see, the narrative isn't as concerned with 'manliness' as it is with emotional transparency, which is a revelation for this sort of action-packed stuff. Frankly, it's what we need right now. Of course, the focal duo do have to fight to survive - this is an action game, after all. Their epic odyssey is communicated with gorgeous visuals and a deep lore. It's sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope. The whole experience is conveyed within a single camera movement, so it all feels urgent and, from a technical perspective, incredibly impressive. The gameplay is much different to that of the series' prior titles, with slightly less focus on button mashing and more focus on strategy. Having said that, the combat is still frenetic and fast-paced. It's brutally difficult at times and you're pretty much required to engage with its deeper systems to succeed. Thankfully, those systems are incredibly satisfying. In fact, the combat is the deepest it's ever been in the series and, once you're used to it, it's the most enjoyable, too. In-between the combat encounters are the puzzles you've come to expect and they're all surprisingly engaging. It's probably because every single one is propelled by the plot, as is all the fighting. The game does an excellent job of telling its tale while you're in control and, thanks to the seamless nature of its cut-scenes, making you feel like you're in control even when you aren't. It's seriously amazing. The story is absolutely riveting, the character work is second to none, the aesthetic is gorgeous and the gameplay is sublime. The overall experience is easily the best in its already fantastic franchise. It's also one of best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. 10/10;10/10;13 May 2020;13 out of 15 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;God of War;An absolute powerhouse in storytelling and production value.;God of War deviates from the traditional linear style of the previous games and gives you a semi open world (hub world if you will). Each hub is astonishingly beautiful, or haunting depending on which one you're in. Especially the "home" hub, the Lake of Nine, is a pleasure to explore. The way more of the map gets revealed as you progress is a joy to behold.Kratos and Atreus are awesome protagonists, and how they change through the game is very interesting and heart warming. Support characters are some of the strongest you will see in gaming.The gameplay itself is awesome. The combat is super tight once you unlock some of the abilities and powers. But the thing that grabbed me the most was the exploration and traversal. Figuring out how to get to and open a treasure chest that is out of reach is both satisfying and rewarding. And gaining the materials you need for the best armour is done in a way that is fun.The thing that really resonates with me is the production value. Every cutscene is like something out of a blockbuster movie. Effects, visuals and sound are all on point.An epic journey of discovery and atonement.;10/10;23 May 2021;4 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;Returnal;Misunderstood;After reading some reviews on here I felt obligated to leave one of my own. This game is so misunderstood. Most people that gave this game low ratings are bad at the game and are mad they have to start over after every death. Just because you're not good at a game doesn't mean it's bad. On the contrary, this game is incredible. Great combat that gets more rewarding the more you play and adapt. Weapons become better the more you play and you unlock more powerful consumable as well. The story is up for interpretation, but the difficulty is that way for a reason. The main character is locked in a personal hell that she can never leave.Give this game a chance and I promise you won't regret it.;9/10;18 March 2024;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;Returnal;Fast paced Roguelike;A great game with a lot of variety with the weapons and abilities you can use. A fair amount of choices to be made when you decide what kind of build you want for different fight engagements.There's something left to be said about the final boss when it is the easiest one to beat in the entire game, but the rest of them will give you a challenge on your first run-in with them.A bit lacking with other activities to do in the game other than just moving down a lot of aliens. Could have added more optional challenges to overcome.But overall a nice little challenging experience.;8/10;11 March 2022;3 out of 6 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;Returnal;The dark side of rogue-like.;It's a very well crafted game with some welcomed historical influences and brilliant combat.If you like rogue-like games, like myself, then you'll find it has a lot to offer in the genre, but it misses the mark by being too punishing in the wrong ways.All rogue-like games require some kind of grind, but this is brutal and very unrewarding at times with very little, to no guidance. Other rogue-like games shine a light on what is expected, Returnal is just a closed book which can be exhausting to play after some time, it isn't a good thing. Games should be welcoming, not stubborn. Encouraging but challenging is the way.The balance is a little out, and this game is set out to hurt you, but I do still recommend it a due to its overall design and bullet-hell combat. 7/10.;7/10;8 January 2023;2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;Returnal;good enough;I bought this game for the PS5 because I wanted to try and diversify the type of games I played.This game delivered in amazing ways such as the haptic feedback and sensations you feel on the dual sense 5 which is very reminiscent to what your character is doing in the game. There is also lots of unique and entertaining horror/sci-fi visuals and for that it deserves an 8.The story is very mediocre and the fact that you have to respawn every time you die and it feels like you're not really advancing anywhere specific makes the game hard to enjoy for such a high price. However if the price does come down, it definitely is worth trying out.;8/10;6 June 2021;1 out of 16 found this helpful.

This game doesn't even tell you what to do nor does it have a quest item . This game got awards how ? Guaranteed boys are praising this game. Do not play or buy it. It's rogue like and you lose your weapons when you die, so the game is not worth it. Only way I'll play it is free on ps extra. Not worth $69.99. Avoid this garbage.

Sony Interactive Entertainment;Returnal;Absurd!;Interestingly boring! Just a bunch of rooms appear randomly after each death. You have to start from the very beginning every time! It's amazing how a game can be so boring and futile in the year 2022! The idea of this reincarnation could be a good plot for a cheap Sci-Fi B movie in 90s! This game is ridiculous, not hard! I enjoyed every moment of Elden Ring, Dark Souls and many other difficult games but the vicious circle of this game is frustrating though it's not a difficult game per se. I wouldn't recommend it. To be fair, the idea of "dying equals losing everything" maybe funny for couple of minutes at the beginning but then you'll realize you had this feeling many decades ago playing Atari 2600 games!;1/10;25 December 2022;3 out of 14 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;Returnal;I really wanted to like Returnal but I can't due to these issues;Returnal sounded great on paper but after playing it the game is just a mess. Everything looks the exact same from start to finish. I know it's a rogue like but that doesn't mean it has to look alike. It just makes the game feel empty. The weapons aren't to bad. They get held by the lacking combat. They wanted to make it all fast pace but it just feels uncomfortable. I don't know what it is. The bosses are where the game really takes a nose dive. From example 1 of the bosses has different attacks where you need to avoid it different. Throu dash or jumping. But they both look the same at 1st so you have to guess which way to avoid it. That is unless your lucky enough to be standing on further side of the sweep but if not enjoy getting hit for a mass amount of health. Also in-between each health bar you don't have any time before the next phase so why not just have 1 long health bar with lines in at each new phase. If your going to make it 3 separate health bars it makes you think your gonna have a bit of time in-between each phase to revive your friend or whatever. Which I think there should be during a long encounter anyway but that's just my opinion.At 1 point there was a building which you can't enter. But later after seeing it I got a key and it said it was for the building but you still can't enter it? Why do you give me a key when you still can't enter? Surely someone would have picked up on how misleading and silly that is?Anyway, essentially the game boils down to mindlessly running round the same looking rooms doing random stuff which you don't know if it's optional or its actually driving the progress forward. Eventually it will tell you that you can now open the boss room door. Also here and then it will tell you something about the story. But that's few and far between and you'll probably forget what's actually going on half the time.I like the fact the developers tried something new. However this game would have probably been better if it wasn't a rogue like.;4/10;4 May 2023;1 out of 3 found this helpful.
Sony Interactive Entertainment;Returnal;Creepy alt universe roguelike with limited growth;In short: Surreal setting and intriguing plot with roguelike die-and-start-over gameplay and fluid, polished FPS controls and camera.Lacks the growth and progression of many roguelikes, making many play-throughs entirely wasted, and the game inaccessible if you lack hyper twitch skills.More detail: Mystery right from the start, in a surreal world with a surreal premise, and the intrigue is cleverly built into the rogue-like gameplay, with gradual reveals as you slowly unlock more areas and abilities and discover more secrets. It's dark, creepy, and the lightning, soundtrack, and sound effects combine well.It's the first FPS I've seen that's a roguelike, and I expected it to be poorly implemented. But the controls are smooth, both in movement and shooting, and the camera is easy to control. Areas where combat starts allow for a wide range of tactics, with natural cover, potential for chasms or other drops to maintain distance, and often ways to get higher or lower than the enemies.You might have to be familiar roguelike, rogue-lite, metroidvania style games to properly enjoy the semi-repetitive nature of dying and restarting over and over and over again. But honestly, that's what makes them such addictive games. Most 'runs', you'll unlock just a little more to make the next run easier. It could be a stat boost, a gear upgrade, or a more unique ability that gives you access to shortcuts and new areas. Whatever it is, that constant little increase in achievement just feels so good.Unfortunately, while it looks like there are going to be tonnes of different things to unlock and to discover... the difficulty level can be a significant barrier.In most other roguelikes, the difficulty is extreme to begin with too. But in many, as you replay over and over, you grow in minor ways that ultimately lead you to reaching a level where you can manage. That makes each play-through feel rewarding, even if you die right near the end of a level or after getting tonnes of abilities and power ups - because you know that even though you missed out on that try, you're a fraction closer to success next time. In Returnal, each death just feels like a complete waste, because all the relevant investment and growth is reset each time.Importantly, within each run most of the game mechanics are designed to only award perfection. Three primary examples are:1) The healing items double as max health increases, except you only get that max increase if you don't use it as a healing item. That is, the only way to increase your max health is to never get hit, otherwise the items are wasted in simple healing instead.2) All weapons have a 5-stage power up that is entirely dependent on not getting hit. One of the power ups is a considerable increase in the resource used to gain access to higher level weapons. If you get hit, the power up resets, so your progression will be too slow to ever reach higher levelled weapons.3) Another of the power ups is having an additional weapon ability, such as firing off a range of homing pulses in addition to the main ammunition. If you get hit, it resets back to just the main ammunition.In summary of those three points: if you get hit, you lose out on a range of benefits and bonuses that will prevent you from levelling up properly during that run, in numerous ways. As a result, you'll be more likely to get hit again, and the cycle repeats. The overall impact this has is that if you get hit once or twice, you can be sure that run will be wasted, so you may as well die right there and start afresh. Perfect play or restart, perfect okay or restart, perfect play or restart...Final comment: Another in a string of games that are hard for the sake of being hard. Except in this case, it's otherwise an amazing, intriguing, addictive game. That makes it all the more painful to have to let it go afterixx cd you get stuck in an endless loop of dying with no benefit.;5/10;24 August 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;To Live or To Die In Los Santos;Greetings from Lithuania.To say "Grand Theft Auto V" (2013) is an amazing experience in (almost) every possible way is like to say nothing. This game is pure and simple masterpiece.I won't say anything new that wasn't said millions times before. GTA V is a must own and play for almost anyone who enjoys perfect games. You have like literally and open world in which you can do anything, and everything is done so good, so great. I beat this game on PS4, and to be honest the control at the beginning felt awkward, but its just like for 5,6 hours - then you will get use to them and it will be just awesome. And there couple more minuses (story mode) - i didn't find any purpose for your crews skill levels - there aren't many heists in the story itself (or maybe i missed something). And other thing is sometimes very frustrating controls of the characters when you there is action is some very closed space, thankfully there weren't many of those. And the last thing is a targeting system when you are in a car flying on some 120 km/h - good luck in to shooting some specific targets. That said, GTA 5 is almost perfect. The story narrative, screenplay, acting, voice acting, directing and whole craftsmanship is the best there can be. And i even just started to scratch the surface of GTA Online. Overall - one of the very best ever.;10/10;29 December 2016;30 out of 32 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;I thought it was overrated until I played it;After I joined college I started playing PC games, and that was the time I began learning about gaming outside of Nintendo. Open world games were something that really fascinated me, so that was the genre I started from. I played Assassin's Creed and Watch_Dogs, but I didn't understand why normies liked GTA so much. I thought it must be because they don't know about bigger ad cooler games, until I tried GTA V myself. And I have to say, boy was I so wrong! This really is something unique, something I couldn't get in any other open world AAA game I had played to that point.GTA V is something I'd call the era defining game of our time. It has everything we want: A good story, interesting characters, a dynamic open world, interactive NPCs and most importantly, it can run on any device (other than Nintendo and mobile phones). I have a habit of playing games linearly, that is, going from point A to point B. I only care about the story of a game and explore the open world only after I complete the main story mode, so that I can delete the game in case my laptop starts going slow (it's an Nvidia 940MX), and also because I have too many unplayed games in my library and I'd choose to finish them rather than look at a game whose story I've already completed.And that made it even more engaging. because the story is really gripping and funny at the same time. In the beginning I was annoyed when Michael was shown the first time, putting his gun on Franklin's head. But after Michael's family left him I was really interested in knowing how he will fix things back. But then the scene shifted to Trevor. I was really annoyed, and I would always shift to Michael to finish his quests. But after I replayed the game after it became free on Epic, I realised Trevor's story was the funniest of them all. Now Trevor has become my favourite character of the three.The graphics are really realistic. And the best part is, if you have a high end PC you can download mods to make the game look as realistic as possible. There are even mods for bringing your own characters like Superman or Hulk, and the best part is that Rockstar, unlike other AAA companies (read Nintendo) encourages players to do it rather than punish them for the same. The NPCs are also very interactive. They behave just like how any person in real life would. Being an indie game developer myself I know how much effort goes behind doing this.Just by looking at GTA V you can see how much love the developers poured into making it. The game has been available for every console from the 7th generation and will also be for the 9th generation. Gaming companies should learn from Rockstar and take this example for their games too (especially Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed II would have been so awesome if it was remastered for PS5 and Xbox Series X). I really hope GTA VI is able to outperform this game. They can take as much time as they want, I have no problem with it.;10/10;11 July 2021;20 out of 21 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;The Perfect Game for Everyone;Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most Universally praised games of all time. This juggernaut of a game lives up to the hype and exceeds it. With 40-50 hours of story and an incredibly packed online mode, Grand Theft Auto V would already be considered one of the greatest games of all time, but including its vehicles, customization, acting, weapons, comedy, depth and messages about a modern America, this game cements itself above some of the greatest games of all time and may just be the greatest game ever made.;10/10;21 April 2020;13 out of 13 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Very enjoyable gaming experience with lots of character, color and fun;In the city of Los Santos, a young hustler falls under the wing of a former criminal living a difficult retirement. Circumstances lead to the pair to have to do a job to pay off a debt – a job which gets national coverage and draws unwanted attention from a former partner, corrupt cops, ruthless movie moguls, rival gangs, aggressive fitness fanatics and many others.I have played this game series on and off over the years but (criminally) did not play the former one based in Los Santos but instead rejoined with GTA4, a game I enjoyed but not one without its flaws. The good news with V is that the game keeps the strengths of the fourth game but makes many improvements which produce a much more fun and enjoyable experience across many aspects. The first thing to say is that the world of LS is technically amazing in terms of its attention to detail and beauty – it is hard to describe to people who decide they do not like these games, but to see a glorious sunset from a hillside, with perfect shadow effects and vegetation movement and know that someone designed and made this, not just filmed it, is something that hit me over and over throughout the game. The map is enjoyably large with diverse landscapes and character and I still find great pleasure in just going around in it even if I have nothing specific to do.The story is solid enough for the game even if it is rather generic and overblown. The characters are quite clichéd in some regards. Michael's story for instance is not so imaginative and generally I found him the least of the characters. Franklin is similar but covered by him being the "intro" character, so I stayed close to him throughout. Trevor is a wonderfully violent and funny character and his entrance is memorable and really shakes the game up. The events of the story are necessarily overblown but this is part of the fun and generally I liked the flow to it. The many supporting characters are great fun and the energy and color of it all does cover up for the fact that the story is not really that complex or engaging at times. As it is though, it is about events and set-pieces and the game provides plenty of fun memorable missions (admittedly as well as a handful of awful ones), and in this way there are loads of missions to replay and enjoy and, most importantly, this game actually allows you to load them to do just that.Side missions add color and fun and, although I do miss ongoing missions like the vigilante ones from IV, there is still plenty to do. The range of vehicles adds to this and I also enjoyed how much easier they are to drive than in the previous game. Weapon customization and the range of them provide fun destruction, although the police are a lot more aggressive in this game than in IV, so it is harder to go on a rampage and make it last. In theory the Online world offers endless gaming – I tried it for one evening and it was fun despite all the issues, but the community seemed messed up and very reliant on having an existing group of players – it looks fun but I'm just more of an offline player these days.Grand Theft Auto V is a great game, even if you "only" play the days and days of content in the single player game. Technically the game is astounding with its attention to detail and just the sheer beauty of the audio and visual design of the whole world. The plot is solid enough to do the job while the characters (main and supporting) are colorful enough to engage while playing through missions which are mostly enjoyable and offer plenty of big set-pieces that are overblown and fun.;Not Informed;13 December 2013;23 out of 25 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Outstanding, Rockstar you've done it again!;One of the most highly anticipated games we have seen ever and it has not disappointed. I have been a fan since the very first GTA entered my console a number of years ago and have played them ever since with great enjoyment and GTA 5 just tops the rest. From the characters to the amazing graphics it is easily the best game I have ever played, after playing The Last Of Us I didn't think the graphics could be topped but they have and then some. With the selection of 3 characters to play it adds that little bit more fun and you get a more in depth view of the person you're playing, and of course GTA would not be the same without the crazy dialogue and damn right funny events that happen.Borrow,Beg,(don't steal) and get yourself a copy. 10/10;10/10;17 September 2013;80 out of 99 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;The gold in Rockstar's mine.;This game is absolutely beautiful, even the most minimum detail in the game is amazing. Rockstar has carved a beautiful sculpture over the last years. The beautiful storyline, graphics, characters, EVERYTHING. Now GTA not only has 1 as said before, but 3 characters, Franklin is struggling the life in the hood with his home Lamar Davis, while also fighting The Ballas. Michael is a retired bank robber and a father of 2 kids, James De Santa, and Tracey De Santa, with her wife Amanda. Trevor is a psycho trying to sell drugs and nuclear weapons to the Chinese. They will team up to: Steal banks, work for the FIB, hang out, and more! Also I can honestly say. This game, is one of the MOST detailed game since Red Dead Redemtion. The weather effects, dynamic events, Strangers and Freaks, and ACTIVITIES! But also there are a lot of COOL Easter eggs.

Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;This has to be the best game I've ever played!;I just want to start off with this: BUY THIS GAME! This is just brilliant with beautiful graphics and great, fun, and hilarious characters. By reading the other reviews I'd think that they really love this game too. My favorite characters are all of them. I think they all have great stories and fun to play with. The cars are really fast and awesome! The weapons are awesome! Everything is just amazing. My favorite part of the map would have to be the beach. I just love going there and stealing bikes and making Chop chew on civilians! I would like to finish this by telling you to tell your friends about this and buy this game now!;10/10;20 September 2013;62 out of 80 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Game of the year, 2013.;The Grand Theft auto series is a juggernaut of everything - Money, Fun, Controversy, Sex, drugs, the works. But us fans of the series would not have it any other way. every time, Rockstar always hits the jackpot.In this 5th installment of the series, Protagonist Michael De Santa is a retired criminal who committed a series of heists and bank robberies in his past, and has retired to a more desired life up in the hills with his family. But not all is as it seems. His wife is more attracted to the young tennis coach and the yoga instructor, his daughter puts herself out like a prostitute, and his son is an overweight Generation Y bum who doesn't work, but has plenty of time to smoke weed and insult other gamers on FPS games. He himself is miserable, drinking during the day and starting arguments over nothing.But not only is Michael a protagonist, so is his old friend Trevor, a maniacal redneck who lives to cause chaos and anarchy, but making money in the process by selling crack and arms. But to Trevor, Michael might as well be an angel, because Trevor is a real maniac.The last protagonist is franklin, a streetwise hustler who repos cars in a time of economic uncertainty, as well as deal with his homies in the hood as well as his strange aunt.I want to review this game, piece by Piece Story 6/5 I'm sorry, but this game's story is just so complex and amazing that you can't help but think rockstar went the extra mile. they did an amazing job, and it shows. No matter what kind of hero you like, this game gives you 3 choices. Me, personally? I like playing as Michael or Trevor, but franklin just isn't my kind of guy. There's one mission early in the game where Michael does yoga, and it's probably the most boring mission yet, but the other crazy missions and moments in the game more than make up for it.Gameplay 5/5 This game's gameplay is almost perfect, albeit a few skips in the framerate when things get hot. other than that, good cars spawn often enough (Much like in 2002's Vice city) and car customization is great. You can also buy clothes and do haircuts for the characters, but some are limited, like Trevor, who can only have a mullet and a bushman beard as special haircuts.there are lots of fun additions to the game, like animals and scuba diving. so if you're a sadistic maniac and love hurting animals (which look like they were copy and pasted right from Red Dead Redemption) or maybe you're an aquaphile and want to go for a swim, this game has lots to offer. look around and see what you may find.And oh yeah, this is the first GTA game that gives you 3 different characters to pick from. So switch between characters and check out what they're all up to at the moment.Music 4/5 This is the first grand theft auto game in which rockstar has created an original soundtrack, giving it a red dead redemption feel during missions where tension runs high. Hearing a fast paced techno tune while running away from the police is always a good time.The game's OST is actually the weakest link in the chain, as a majority of tracks will not appeal to the game's main fans. There's no lack of pop music, With Britney Spears and Rihanna (Niko Bellic: Hooray.) but a big lack of thrash metal. That's where thrash originated, and that's where it should at least have a station! The game at least doesn't have Taylor Swift. Thank God.There's a classic Punk Rock Station and a classic country station, which in it's Advertisements, claim that modern country is full of sissies and crybabies. I could not agree more. Controls 5/5 The game's engine is the same as GTA IV, but with a few improvements. these ones take time to get used to, but once you do, just hit the gas and go crazy. the fighting mechanics are the same, but this time, you don't have to scroll through your weapons like in IV. This time, you can pull an RDR and bring up a weapon wheel, and pick your gun from an array of choices.Overall - 10/10I think this game will get Game of the year from whatever awards show gives those out. with 4 years of development, a $265,000,000 budget, and a massive storyline which will take a while to get through, there will be no shortage of fun for those who play it.;10/10;19 September 2013;51 out of 68 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Best Game Ever Made, Grand Theft Auto V is incredible.;Anyone who gives this less 9, there is really something wrong with that person, seriously. The great soundtrack, "multiplayer", many customization options, controversial missions and lots of mini, complex places, amazing graphics, the actual contemporary story and pretty much everything its just beautiful. Being honest, since Grand Theft Auto San Andreas I haven't been this satisfied/happy for a video game and worth it. The faults in the system aren't reason enough to hate the game. I've actually spent dozens of hours with Grand Theft Auto V, and I definitely plan to continue. GTA Online in one word: perfection, your ambitions are the limit and basically you can do whatever you want. I can't wait to see whats next with Rockstar and of curse the actualizations of the game.;10/10;14 July 2014;31 out of 42 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;An Honest Review;I wasn't playing video games when IV came around, and... if it weren't for COVID I wouldn't have picked them up again, at least not new ones.But COVID hit so... XBox. And GTA V, honestly took me for a loop when I started off playing three different people, then ended up playing Franklin, only to switch to someone different. It was jarring and erratic, and I just wanted to follow one character and stay with them...... until Trevor came in and... HYSTERICAL.The world pops more than San Andreas did, it pops almost the same way that Vice City popped. The music is fun, there are more variety to the stations.... but the talk radio lacks the humor of the previous installments and you really don't have that wait to open up other parts of the city that seems to you clung to, hoping that the next mission would be the one that gave you a little more of the world to explore.But over all, it is a heck of a lot of fun. It's entertaining. It's rich, the story is funny and brutal at the same time and the characters are.... well, they are all characters.Couple that with the heist movie feel and it's a solid winner.;10/10;4 November 2020;9 out of 11 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Amazing and awful.;The single-player story mode: 10/10The online multiplayer mode: 1/10The online in this game managed to derail this company's approach to DLC entirely. Remember Undead Nightmare for Red Dead Redemption, and Ballad of Gay Tony on GTA IV? Yeah, we'll probably never get DLCs like that from this company ever again. From now on it's going to be all about adding cosmetics and vehicles in the hopes of people saying screw it and buying in-game currency with real money instead of playing the purposely dull and repetitive missions with tiny payouts.;7/10;4 August 2021;16 out of 25 found this helpful.

I had also spent a few hundred thousands of dollars and hours producing the cargo. How do they expect me to do these missions when I can't use an invite only session while doing these missions?

The Graphics of the City, so Realistic. Now, The Story is Excellent. I found myself Laughing, Sad, And sometimes very shocked. The story has a good plot and and nice characters to begin with. The Intro, Best Intro in the GTA Series Ever. The Freemode is fun. You always have something to do. Its Fun and Exciting. Now, GTA Online is the Best Online Yet. You can Freemode in Online and drive around the Los Santos or Sandy Shores. I like that you can customize your own Character. The Non-Stop fun doing missions and Buying House or Pimping your Ride.

Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Probably the most disappointing game of all time;Anyone who gives this game a 10/10 is either insane, is being paid by Rockstar, is about 12 years old or has never played any other game before. It is without doubt the most disappointing game of all time and a 6/10 at absolute best and the scores the 'critics' have given it just proves the fact that they are not worth reading.Good - Not very much, but the 3 characters are well designed and the map itself is adequate in size. The overall gameplay is solid and there is definitely some fun to be had with some of the set piece missions standing out in particular.Bad - Where to start? No ambient hiests, severe, almost criminal lack of interiors, no character progression, development or empire building of any kind, unable to buy houses, unable to enter owned businesses (lack of interiors!), awful, awful story, only around 30% of the map is actually used for anything useful, the friend 'like' % has been ditched so doing any activity with any other character is pointless, the girlfriend system is awful, unfinished concepts (Trevors meth business) and in general just terrible design decisions everywhere. There is a total lack of anything meaningful to do in this game. I mean its all well and good being able to play golf but where are things like dealing etc that can be used to run a criminal empire? Verdict - The most overrated, over-hyped game ever made which is a shame because it could, and should have been great. If you like driving around aimlessly with the option to play a pointless minigame this could be the game for you. If you have a brain though, you will be left bitterly disappointed by an average game thats a 6/10 (generous) and one of the worst games in the GTa series, FACT.;6/10;18 May 2015;12 out of 32 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;You live this game, not play it.;Rdr2 is an experience, as it's more than just a video game. It's like being in one long Oscar winning movie. Script, acting, storyline are immense, it's quite unbelievable really. You are living as a cowboy day in day out eating, bathing, sleeping, everything in a huge openworld. Action aside this is a great story, it's a prequel to RdR1. It has a massive amount of missions and side missions. I played the game for literally several weeks doing missions or just doing what I wanted it was an incredible experience and that is what this is, an experience. A word of warning it does start of very slow, the initial missions you don't feel free at all but when that snow goes the game really begins and you won't look back. One piece of advice whilst you are playing the early chapters, appreciate it.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Best game Ive ever played;This game is nearly perfect in every way. Graphics are gorgeous, from ever muscle in the horses as they move, to every blade of grass. The attention to detail is absolutely crazy. Walking in town you may see 2 dogs playing. Fishing? You might look across the river and see a grizzly grabbing his dinner. Its the tiny details like this that add zero to the game, but helps immerse you in the world of Arthur. The story is fantastic. It has touching moments, humor, suspense. If you had someone watching as you play the game, I can almost guarantee they'll want to know what happens next. The characters are multi-dimensional. Almost no one is completely evil or completely good. They are each layered and the most honest adaptation of people Ive ever seen in a game. The acting is absolutely the best of any game, hands down. Thats one thing that will ruin a great game for me, if the voice acting is lazy and uninspired. The actors in this game are the best, from Arthur to a minor character you might meet once, to a background character in the saloon. The gameplay? Wow. Smooth as can be. Sure there are some glitches here and there but for a game this size there are shockingly few. I can see why we had to wait nearly 10 years for this. Its a masterpiece. Rockstar earned every penny of the $100 I paid for this. I keep hoping for DLC, another chapter, anything for storymode. Even another Nightmare game would be welcomed.;10/10;8 September 2019;120 out of 126 found this helpful.

For those saying that the "controls are too clunky", "you have to fight like the devs planned", stop playing because it's not like that at all.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;True Masterpiece;This game reminds me of a scene in movie Matrix were Neo is told Matrix cannot be explained but you needs to be seen to understand it. RDR2 is a game no matter how much explained or how many reviews you read it cannot be explained but you need to play it and see it in action to understand that this is not your regular AAA game, anyone who plays games and knows anything about gaming would know straight away that everything rockstar has claimed is true, 8 years in the making is not a joke. Couple of people here have left negative reviews, I just want to say to them you should carry on playing games on your mobile phones or handheld devices because you have no idea about gaming and stop pretending to be gaming experts. Only a moron of the highest level can give this true masterpiece a 1 out of 10.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;God bless Rockstar!!;Coming up with a masterpiece like this could have only been possible for Rockstar. I have absolutely no words to describe this game. Everything is on point. Story, gameplay, graphics, characters, dialogues, pacing, etc. are just perfect! Everything has been paid attention to. This is definitely the most realistic game ever!!The character of Arthur Morgan has been brilliantly written. His bonding with his fellow gang members especially with Dutch Van der Linde is unique. I also love the bonding between other gang members. Dutch's speeches are very deep and thought provoking!!Being an outlaw has never felt so beautiful!! Although it's a game, it feels more like a movie that is playable. It makes you feel physically present in the wild west. Cheers to Rockstar for bringing the wild west back to life in such a wonderful way!I think this game along with God of War will go down as 2 of the greatest games in the history of videogames. With RDR2, Rockstar has established itself as the no.1 game studio!! God bless Rockstar!!;10/10;17 November 2018;60 out of 71 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Overrated;I feel most reviews of this game came out too quickly after shock and awe of the incredible graphics, animations and physics this game has to offer. But clunky and sometimes down right horrible controls, the typical cliché and worn out Rockstar formula to mission design, stupid cartoon characters and story telling seems to be scuffed under the carpet.I too was amazed by how the world looked, and that everything flowed with smooth framerate either you were in a busy town or in a deep forest. You can see mountains hundreds miles away and knowing that you can go there without loading times feels amazing.But we must not forget, we also could do all this in RDR1, which came out 8 years ago. Also in similiar Rockstar titles suck as GTA4. Games who also looked amazing when they were released.Think of it as a RDR1, only with steroids. You can do a ton of more stuff here, all from cleaning your weapons, to personalize them down the the color, metal type, length of barrel. You get the picture. This game is all about details: you can be rude to towns folk, or nice to them. Rob them. Threaten them. Beat them up. Kill them. You name it. And the way they react to you are realistic and very varied. It's rarely you ever hear a person say the same thing twice. And finally the wanted system is more realistic now: Do a crime unseen and you have to wait for another NPC to see the corpse, then run to the law, then the law will come and inspect the surrounding area. If you are seen you can lie and say you had nothing to do with it and they let you go. But if you return to the crime scene after, and the law is still there they will arrest you for suspicious behaviour. It's quite deep and now it's more fun to run around robbing and looting people.But sadly, it plays just like any other Rockstar game: The covering system is slow and clunky just like in GTA 4. The shooting also feels excactly the same. And you can forget about trying to play this without auto aiming. I tried free aim, but the controls are either way too sensitive or way to slow at times. I tried to set it up as good as the game allowed me to with removing deadzone and tweaking the sensitivy. No matter what I did it feels almost impossible to aim what you are looking at. I had no trouble doing this in RDR1 since I played it in hardcore mode, so I wonder what the hell happened? Maybe it's the PS4's controller who is the issue?But is not the only thing that stands in the way of gameplay and cause irritations: You can set up what weapons your character wants to use. You can carry a limited amount of weapons, the rest is in your horse's saddle. So let say you want to carry a shotgun, rifle and two pistols. Well for some reason after some time. after a mission or if you are killed or restarts a save, you have to set up all this again. It's quite tedious and time consuming. Also numerous time I pressed the draw button and nothing happened. I thought it was something wrong with the game so I pressed a few more times, and suddenly he drew his gun. This got me killed many times. The game also forces you in situations where you have to make a choice before you can aim, which is super frustrating since you are pressing the draw button and nothing happends. It feels more like a clunky RPG games at time which does not work in an action scenario. Also buttons for doing sertains tasks changes making you many times pressing the wrong button or just have constantly check what the screens whant you to press. Rockstar: When I want to draw my weapon... just let me press one button and let the character do so, okay? Also another very annoying thing is that if you set your character to use the shotgun... later on when you draw, he draws his gun for some reason. Or again: not draw at all. Resulting in death or lot of damage.Also the controller input is slow and sluggish. you press a button and half a second or up to a second later the animation takes place. This also occurs in shooting. I am at a guy, and the second I press it takes half a second for the gun to shoot. By this time the enemy might have moved slightly so the shot misses. Irritating and frustrating. Also, with the lock on shooting / auto aim and always a hitmarker popping up showing if you hit or killed an enemy is immersion breaking as hell. Here you have this gorgeous looking game who sometimes looks almost photo realistic and you get this childish old shooting mechanics. It doesn't blend well. Also for some reason they added grey tracers coming out of the guns which looks quite stupid and ridiculous. This is clearly done to make the game easier to see excactly where you are getting shot from. But with their excellent sound system and visuals it would not hard to tell where the shots came from. The guns do have smoke, remember? Speaking of smoke, I wished they would add more volumetric and realistic smoke pouring out of the guns in the direction they were shooting. Like it was in real life. Instead we just have a big muzzle flash with a bit of smoke puffs that disappear way too quickly. If they had manage to implement this, the shooting scenes would look way better and more fun. I must also mention the game has no bullet drop / ballistic physics. So if an enemy has you in his sight and pull the trigger he will hit you no matter what even if you change direction 300 meters awyay form him. Quite annoying and it also makes firefights too easy but also too hard some time. If the game had more realistic shooting mechanics, it would be easier to go back to the game and just have fun shooting. As it is now, you get very quickly bored of the shooting.Thank god the euphoria engine is back though: Many thought it would be dumbed down like in GTA5, but it's back and better than every. You will never see a body fall the same thanks to the physics a.i. Blood and particle sputters as you shoot people. You can even blow off their heads and limbs if you have a powerful weapon. It looks quite amazing. The bodies sound and physics all have a proper weight and feel to them. Good job.The story is as you expect from any other Rockstar game. Especially from RDR1: Main quest has a more serious tone, while the sidequests and stranger events you just meet corky weird persons who doesn't feel believeable. Also Rockstar humour sometimes fails thinking that if a character is acting silly and have weird body emotions we should laugh. I didn't. I just got annoyed. That being said, there are some funny moments, but they are far in between. And many times you just know what is coming next, so it gets very predictable.The main story had three main characters I liked: Dutch, Micah and Arthur. Dutch is psychopath, Micah is pure evil and Arthur is just being himself, which is sarcastic a bit fed up and tired of this gang life. The rest of the characters in game is easy to forget since they are quite boring.I won't give any spoilers but I was disappointed with the ending. Dutch choices didn't make any sense due to the way he behaved during the entire game. Felt like logic was thrown out the window.I both love this game, and hate it at the same time. I wished that somebody else had made this game, except Rockstar. That understood better story telling and gameplay. Maybe Rockstar should have provided the graphics and physics engine and let someone else do the rest. I say this because I love Western games and movies. I feel this was a missed oppertunity to create something new and inique. Instead we just got a standard Rockstar game with updated graphics and physics. Leaving nothing new in therms of gameplay and storytelling.So should you get RDR2? Tough question. If you love Western movies, attention to details, just walking slowly, or take your horse on a nice walk up the mountains, hunt some animals, kill some bandits, rob a train or stagecoach. Yes, you should. I had more fun time in free roam than doing the boring missions. Sadly varied free roam options only unlocks when you do missions. Walking around in a town, interacting with people, seeing the incredible graphics, animations and sound design was more of a game to me than all the rest the game had to offer.;7/10;7 November 2018;28 out of 102 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;A graphical marvel, but...too slow.;Basically what the title says. The graphics and attention to detail is staggering! Huge bonus to be able to choose between 1st and 3rd person view too, AMAZING!! But the gameplay and general feel of the game is too slow, at least for me. There is ALOT of back and forth. The missions and activities seem extremely scripted and the game holds your hand quite alot. The gunplay is stupid, having to manually cock the hammer of the revolver is just dumb imo, prefer the gunplay in rdr1. The "random" events does not seem random at all, more like "triggered by proximity". The story itself is decent enough, I am only about 20 hours in, still at chapter 2, but when I got a certain mission in which I needed to steal horse carriages I simply did not feel like playing anymore. The main protagonist is an ass, same as the rest of the gang, don't really care for any of them. Fast travel is the same as rdr1 (which was trash) and it just makes the smallest missions seem like a chore because you need to ride 3km to shoot something and ride back to get a new mission, I suppose u could make camp and then fast travel,but why not simply do it like witcher 3 or AC Odyssey? A better fast travel system is what this game needs. Shame really, I want to like it, but too clunky controls, boring missions and slow horse has made me quit playing.;4/10;4 January 2019;20 out of 99 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;The Most Awaited Game of 2018;Without a doubt, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been the most awaited game of 2018. Originally, it was to have been released in September 2017, but had many delays. Were the delays worth the wait? Yes in deed. The graphics are stunning and the writing is great. On its first day of release, Red Dead Redemption 2 was already having record sales.Sometime in late November 2018, there is to be an online multiplayer mode, which as of the release of the game was still under development. If Grand Theft Auto V online (which is also a Rockstar game) is any indication of what we can expect, I believe it'll be great. If you are able to, buy the special edition of Red Dead Redemption 2, and you'll receive all of the add-ons and current DLC.Have fun playing!;10/10;27 October 2018;88 out of 113 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Perhaps even better than its predecessor.;'Red Dead Redemption II (2018)' simply is a masterpiece. It might even be better than its predecessor. It's one of the absolute best looking games ever to be released. its huge, varied world is rendered in an impressive, almost photo-real way. It's filled to the brim with life, from birds circling in the sky overhead to fish swimming in the river beneath your feet to strangers stuck by the side of the road. The open-world is probably the most detailed and lived-in I've ever experienced. It feels markedly real. That's a good thing, too, considering the amount of time you'll spend traversing it. Riding to and from your main objectives will often take longer than the missions themselves. The lack of comprehensive fast travel means you'll be doing this long after you've seen every beautiful location the map has to offer. Thankfully, then, no two journeys are ever the same. The amount of ways you can interact with the people you meet out in the world is amazing, and the small encounters you directly control are incredibly satisfying to play. They're possibly the best aspects of the game. That's because the main missions, which can often feel restrictive when compared to the free-roaming stuff, are as often utterly thrilling as they are frustratingly slow. The piece has a deliberate pace which unfortunately means that it takes a while to truly get going. However, it very much adds to the overall experience. It's supposed to be long, ebbing and flowing as its seasons and circumstances change. Its extended epilogue does take the wind out of the sails of its ending, but it's arguably vital in achieving the effect the finale is meant to have. Regardless of its issues, the narrative is straight-up phenomenal. It tells an at once personal and sweeping tale, crafting characters that seem so human you could swear they were real. Something that the piece does a phenomenal job with is the development of its side-characters. The people who don't get much play in the cut-scenes can be spoken to around camp, or even taken on small adventures, which is somehow enough for you to form almost as close a connection with them as you do with any other. When one of your companions inevitably dies, it's genuinely heartbreaking. That can be said of the overall thing, too. It's heartbreaking. Yet, it's also exciting, funny, hopeful, tragic, beautiful and, even, poignant. It strikes the perfect balance between sincere and satirical. It's generally more serious than its predecessor and, as such, it's more impactful. Most of the silliness is reserved for its entertaining side-missions, which suits them well. It's often genuinely affecting and it has a strong underlying theme that lives up to its title. The writing is just wonderful. It's consistently good across each and every character you meet. The morality system actually changes some small things about the story, too. For the best result, you should get all of your dastardly doings out of the way to begin with. the most fitting ending, thematically, is the 'high honour' one. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and varied, with satisfying shooting and surprisingly deep mini-games. The animation, which is superb, does sometimes get in the way, causing some slight chunkiness that can be cumbersome to begin with. However, this is easy to adjust to and it simply adds to the overall slower pace of the game. It's a measured affair, never as unrelentingly fast as some of its peers but nearly always more satisfying. In the end, this is an engaging, entertaining and affecting experience. It's a massive, thematically rich ride that stands out as one of the best games of all time. 10/10;10/10;15 April 2020;30 out of 36 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;A game that changed the industry forever;Red Dead Redemption 2 is not like any other video game ever made including its predecessor. Red Dead Redemption 2 stands on its own and gives us one of the greatest video games of all time and is my own personal favorite video game. From the visuals to even the acting, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a league of its own in the video game genre. The story is a prequel to the first Red Dead Redemption game and follows Arthur Morgan in a gang of outlaws that includes a lot of characters from the first game, including John Marston who was the protagonist in the first game. After a job gone wrong in a town called Blackwater and they suffer unimaginable losses, the gang heads from town to town down a road for a better life, while robbing and conning their way to the american dream. Roger Clark who voices Arthur Morgan is absolutely fantastic portraying the title character in this game and gives us a character unlike its previous protagonist. Arthur Morgan is hands down my personal favorite video game character ever and I never expected to care so much about a fictional gaming character until I played this game. This is also hands down one of the most visually stunning games I've ever played as well, that has visuals unlike any gamer has ever seen before. Finally, this game has one hell of a story and takes us on a journey that we never imagined would end. With that being said, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a video game that stands on its own that will be remembered and played for years to come with the help of stunning visuals, a great story, amazing gameplay and fantastic acting.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;An instant classic;Greetings from Lithuania.So after spending more the 60 hours on a single player campaign and finishing the story and after reaching now level 35 in online, i can safely say "Red Dead Redemption II" (2018) is one of the kind. This is a pure classic. Where to start.Graphics are simply amazing. The story itself was epic and reminded of the best westerns i have ever seen. The storytelling was mesmerizing - i can't remember last time that i have played for a more compelling character then Artur Morgan. Sure the beginning of this game, like first 3-5 hours weren't that amazing, because this game takes its time to be played - literally. Like every single action that you do requires time. This is not a straightforward "GTA 5" in the west - its actually quite opposite. The pacing is slow in here, and some might not appreciate it, but after i got used to it, this game blew me away. I loved ever single thing in it.Overall, "Red Dead 2" is my personal game of the year. I loved "God of War", but "Red" transformed the open world genre into another level. The attention to details are mind blowing. Literally almost everything in this game is almost perfect. Its not a perfect game that is for sure, but its a pure classic - one of the best i have ever played and intend to play. Terrific experience to say the least.;10/10;6 January 2019;17 out of 20 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;I get why people love it, but it contains hundreds of minor frustrations;I get why people love this game, it's brilliant, but a little too brilliant for its own good.For example, people laud this game's copious amounts of details detail, which can be cool in a lot of cases, like Rockstar's attention to detail in animal behavior, which is awesome to just observe at times, but other times the amount of visual detail and animation is more cumbersome and annoying than it is immersive, which absolutely isn't aided by the game's finicky controls. Since the game's controls are so imprecise, there will be hundreds of occasions where you'll click a button you didn't mean to click, or you won't be facing in the precise direction you need to be facing in order to do the action you wanted to do, so you'll be subjected to watching Arthur in an over-animated manner mount his horse, which lasts for literal seconds, before you can push the button that gets off his horse, an animation that also lasts for literal seconds, before you can do the thing you were trying to do before accidentally mounting your horse. Or, every single time you kill an animal, to collect its skin you have to sit through an unskippable animation of Arthur skinning whatever animal it is that also lasts for literal seconds. Or if you loot a body, you don't just automatically take whatever valuables a body has on it when you choose to loot, instead you have to watch another animation that lasts for literal seconds where Arthur bends over, rummages through their pockets, and then pulls something out through their vest pockets. All of these things are attention to detail in manners that actively make the game less fun to play. It would be all the more bearable if you were simply capable of pushing a button that would cancel whatever action you're doing in case you accidentally hit the wrong button or prompted Arthur to do something you didn't mean to do, but no, you are committed to sitting the gratuitously over-animated sequences through literally every mistake you ever make due to how finicky this game's controls are. Yes, the attention to detail in a lot of cases is very cool, but a lot of that detail just simply doesn't make the game fun.It's also annoying that you can't sprint through town areas without every NPC you pass acting like you're attempting to assault them, or if you accidentally forget to holster your weapon before entering a town area you'll have law enforcement raining bullets on you in a matter of seconds, so you're stuck walking very slowly for an eternity through buildings and town areas for fear you'll be wanted for "disturbing the peace" in case you accidentally nudge an NPC, which also makes the game significantly less fun to play. There was a time I had just wanted to sell a skin in one of the city areas, but I didn't feel like walking at a snail's pace all the way to the trapper, so I started I hit X to make myself move faster, and almost immediately I was wanted for "disturbing the peace," to which law enforcement showed up, which began a citywide firefight that left me fleeing for my life to the next town over so I could pay off my bounty and go back to the trapper to sell just one bloody skin. Moments like these are irritating and cumbersome, and it's extremely frequent moments like these that prevented me from falling in love with the game.The writing and characters and acting is very good, as expected, so it's worth checking out, it's just a shame that it isn't as much fun to actually play.;7/10;9 August 2019;6 out of 25 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;You want to play in your own movie? You've got it!;Rockstar have been slowly draining away at my insanity for the release of this game, the teasers were enough to wet the appetite of myself and other players respectivly who were interested in this type of game.It wouldn't seem fair to compare this to GTA as other reviwers have ,purely because it has taken a completely different direction. Yes, you can still take cars, yes you can shoot and yes you can still drive around like a maniac but its all cleverly been done in the line of duty. They have taken an approach which has been unorthodox but who cares...it works! The story of Phelps (the player) is very neatly tied in to all the cases that the player must solve. All the previous cases come together and are referred back in later cases. The story has an incredibly thick plot and at times can leave you with a heavier brain once you put the controller down. It's very time consuming but well worth seeing it all the way to the end. Need i say the last case made me shed a tear....so it can be emotional for some.Gameplay wise, L.A. Noire is no where near fast pace by any means, but there is always something new going on, whether it be a police call for a shooting/robbery or even a real case to solve, there's nothing that ever lets the player feel bored or exhausted of the same thing. However this being said, the game has a slight use of repetitiveness in it, but is actually necessary for the development of the story. The controls are very natural and rockstar have really pulled out their finger to achieve something that no other game has achieved, realistic and emotional characters. The whole truth/doubt/lie system is just genius and gave me a warm sense of accomplishment when i actually got the correct answer. The facial animations using the facial motion capture are just breath taking, i sometimes forget i'm playing a game and instead watching a movie, it's that realistic! Graphically stunning, buildings look very real, cars are modelled perfectly and the characters need nothing more added. The whole environment is just brilliant with props to both environment artists and the level designers. Hats off the story board guys, to make a story that ties in so well with each other must make them incredibly imaginative.Overall L.A. Noire has really taken me by surprise, I really wasn't sure what i would expect to get until i played it through and my god you get hell of a lot for your money. If you don't come out with an IQ higher than 100 after completing this game, you went somewhere wrong. The game has been intelligently put together and has really left a mark on me. I'd recommend this to any player who likes an interactive, action, mystery and an adventure game packed all in one.Well done Rockstar!;10/10;23 May 2011;41 out of 44 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;A Truly Mature Game;I won't lie. I picked this game up due to the overwhelming hype surrounding it, and the track record of Rockstar. What I didn't expect was an experience as close to playing a movie as I've ever seen. A narrative full of characters that talked and acted like real people, and a hero that is flawed in realistic ways. Team Bondi put a lot of work in getting everything to look and feel as authentic as possible, and it shows. I've played through this twice now, nearly two years apart, and been completely and totally engrossed by the story and the amazing facial motion-capture technique that just adds an extra dimension to the characters you'll come across during it's very long running time.Some comments have been made about the extended cutscenes and what can be viewed as tedious and repetitive gameplay, but I had no problem with either of these aspects of the game, as the plot completely sucked me in. Make no mistake about it, this is a very mature tale that features brutal crime scenes, language, and violence, all of which are handled very matter-of-factly. There was never a point where I felt these things were over-the-top, however, but, rather, I felt these aspects added to the realism. Along with this, the whole city of Los Angeles in the 1940's has been lovingly recreated, from the buildings and locations, to the vehicles, fashions, and entertainment of that era.If I were to pick anything that I had issues with, it was the noticeable lack of side missions or random events. Given the attention to detail that went in to creating the city, I would have thought the development team could have found more creative things to do within it. There are crimes outside of the main narrative that you can respond to that gain you extra "intuition" points to be used during questioning or clue hunting, but not nearly as many or nearly as diverse as there should have been. Also, this is more than likely a game you won't be turning around and playing again immediately after finishing it. It's probably something that's best revisited maybe every year or two.Overall, I found this to be a stunning and eye-opening look at what games can look and feel like. If this is any indication of what we can expect in the future, I, for one, can't wait to see what's around the corner.;8/10;12 March 2013;25 out of 27 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Unique and superb;Greetings from Lithuania.The only reason i did not gave "L.A. Noire" (2011) a perfect 10/10 is the fact that i played it and finished it a 100% for the first time in 2020, nearly 10 years after its initial release - and games unlike movies do age. I played remastered version.Games like this do not come out anymore. "L.A. Noire" has more in common with a great movie "L.A. Confidential" then any other game i have ever played. It has superb story, amazing writing and compelling characters, with great acing by many actors. Music was great, and game does look great when playing it on PS4 pro 4K - its just that open world feels empty and repetitive. But those are minor complain. Other then that, this is a fantastic game, very unique one.;9/10;10 March 2020;11 out of 11 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Amazing;Rockstar games has done it again! This game is incredible - it's visually stunning, the gameplay is smooth and, most importantly, the story is fantastic. Once you start playing, you become enveloped into Cole Phelps. I bought the game at midnight because I wanted to watch the opening sequence, but I couldn't stop playing! Its true - the line between video games and movies is blurred more than ever. Especially with games like Heavy Rain and LA Noir (amoung countless others, such as Rockstar's own Red Dead Redemption), whose stories are rich and gripping. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about getting it. You won't be disappointed!;10/10;17 May 2011;36 out of 42 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Feels like you have stepped into Hollywood with a part in a 1940's detective movie.;One but cannot help but think that L.A. Noire has been inspired by L.A. Confidential (1997), Chinatown (1974), The Untouchables (1987), and James Ellroy's novel The Black Dahlia. After being in the development hell for seven years, L.A. Noire was released in 2011 and became a massive success. It is definitely worth playing, and if you have the patience to solve challenging puzzles you will enjoy this game. Also, you will learn how to read people during questioning and interrogations as to whether they are telling the truth, doubt them or lying by backing up your claims with evidence.Set in Los Angeles in 1947, the story centers on LAPD police officer Cole Phelps played by Aaron Stanton (Mad Men), a former US Marine Lieutenant who served in World War II in the pacific. Cole Phelps starts out as a patrol officer and throughout the game you see his career rise in the LAPD through various assignments with Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Cole Phelps is also assigned various partners throughout the game including Officer Ralph Dunn (Rodney Scott) in patrol, Detective Stefan Bekowsky (Sean McGowan) in Traffic, Detective Rusty Galloway (Michael McGrady, Southland) in Homicide, Detective Roy Earle (Adam John Harrington) in Vice, and Detective Herschel Biggs (Keith Szarabajka, The Dark Knight) in Arson. Cole Phelps manages to catch the eye of Captain James Donnelly (James Connelly) as a rising star in the LAPD and promises to keep a close eye on Phelps. Phelps also finds himself caught up with German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann (Australian model Erika Heynatz) and butts heads with former US Marine comrade Jack Kelso (Gil McKinney) who is working as claims investigator for California Fire and Life following the death of a former marine Phelps and Kelso served with during World War II.L.A. Noire is very addictive gaming at its best and you can't help but feel you are being thrust into the world of a post World War II Los Angeles. L.A. Noire reminded me a lot of L.A. Confidential.I wish there were more games like L.A. Noire however like this game it may take a number of years before a game similar to this will be released. Definitely one of the best games I have played in years.10/10.;10/10;23 March 2015;14 out of 15 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;A Successful Failure;I know that I will probably get a lot of comments about the tag line I used, but I sincerely believe that L.A. Noire had the potential to be an amazing game, but it fell short in several areas. It's a success because it -is- a great game, fun to play, good story... but it is a failure (to me) because it's the first Rockstar game I've scored less than 9. It fell well short of its potential.I'll get right to it.Graphics - 10/10 There's really no doubt that the game is absolutely gorgeous with the new facial scanning feature. This, coupled with the wonderful lighting and amazing detail to the city makes for a beautiful game to look at.Sound - 10/10 The voice actors are phenomenal. They deliver believable performances without going over the top and they add a perfect amount of emotion to the dialog. The music is also amazing, adding to the overall engrossing atmosphere.Controls - 8/10 There aren't any -major- complaints here. The shooting system leaves something to be desired, especially following in the wake of Red Dead Redemption. Driving controls aren't perfect either, but there have been much, much worse.Story - 9/10 L.A. Noire has a very interesting story behind it. I've heard it said before: GTA meets CSI. That's an accurate assessment. Be prepared for an interesting journey.Fun Factor - 7/10 Here's where things get interesting. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun, challenging at times, and interesting. My main problem with the game is after the first few cases, you'll notice that things get repetitive. You go to a crime scene. You look for clues. You go talk to suspects. You use your clues to get answers. That's about it. It also feels -way- too linear for me, often pushing you from one case to the next without giving you much time to explore the world and have fun.There's a reason for that: There isn't much to do other than the main cases. Sure, you can respond to random calls from dispatch, but even - they- get repetitive. Go to the scene. Shoot out/chase/hostage situation. Rinse and repeat.The major appeal to this genre for most people is the ability to go where you want, do what you want. While you might be able to go anywhere you want between cases, there isn't much to do when you get there. You can't even draw your weapon if you're not on a case. So all of those random rampages you love in GTA/RDR? Forget it. You won't be having those in L.A. Noire.Another part of the game that some may not enjoy is that it often feels as though you're watching more than you're playing. There are a lot of cut scenes. Most of the game is cut scenes.Replayability - 5/10 Since there isn't much to do beyond the main cases... No interesting side-quests, no random gunfights in the street, no stores or mini games or stunt challenges.... You'll already know all of the interrogation techniques, you'll already know who murdered who and why... You'll already have all of the answers. Where is the appeal to play again? Overall - 8/10 It's a great game and an interesting concept. I know it wasn't meant to be a GTA clone, that it was meant to focus on the detective work and case cracking that hadn't successfully been used in a game before. But since the game is so narrow in its options as far as cases/case order/extracurricular activities, it's really hard to justify giving it any more than an 8/10. You'll have a blast playing through the first time. But when the credits roll, you'll find yourself wondering if it's destined to collect dust on your shelf.;8/10;18 May 2011;64 out of 93 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Perfect detective game!;For someone that love detective/mystery movies and books this game was a perfect way for entertainment. L.A Noire was created for around seven years, unfortunately I can count the number of games in Noire climate on one hand, there is only one worth playing – of course it's L.A Noire. Therefore it's more like interactive movie with Grant Theft Auto mechanics and some people expect more challenge from games. I personally find all the puzzles and investigations too easy, I was expecting something more challenging. If you like detective movies and books you will love this game too. If you don't like them than you will most likely find this game boring. If you expect another Grant Theft Auto or Mafia I will have to disappoint you. Rockstar Games made this clear that L.A Noire will not include a lot of shooting. There are side missions. some of them include more fire exchange. Most of the time you will be looking for clues, driving to destined area and interviewing suspects and victims. There are at least 100 different vehicles including bonus vehicles. But what I really like about the game was interrogations and exploration of all the beautiful locations. For me L.A. Noire is located quite close to the narrative perfection, it's a precursor to the new wave of adventure games along with games like Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls or Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead. As result of games like this especially L.A Noire, new games like Murdered: Soul Suspect will be coming out soon. I have to give this game 10/10 because it was something that I was waiting for long time however I'm disappointed that there is lack of information about new Noire game. There is a leaked gameplay of another title from developers, it's called "Whore of the Orient" but it's taking place on the streets of Shanghai and I don't think it's something for me. I never enjoyed Chinese detective movies.;10/10;2 June 2014;5 out of 5 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Technically impressive but not as challenging, fun, clever or as engaging as it should have been and needed to be;LA Noire is the most recent game from Rockstar – a name synonymous with quality sandbox gaming, big open worlds where you follow a main story but have some element of freedom within a larger world. As a result I was excited by the idea of being a cop in the sunny yet seedy world of late 1940's Los Angeles, with its movie stars, its drugs, its secrets – basically it looked like we would all be playing in LA Confidential. To a certain extent the game pulls this off and technically this is where you are.I saw technically because it is in this realm where the game mostly excels. Spread over 3 disks, the game takes place in a massive city, with traffic and people going about their business while you do yours. It looks great from the cars, the outfits, the "look" of the characters in terms of makeup and hairstyles and of course the famous motion capture of the actors faces. This last part is astonishing as you do watch these computer characters and see natural movements and quirks – although viewers of Mad Men will be distracted by just how frequently members of that cast are used. The idea is good with this – use real faces to make the game about being able to spot a "tell" and call out liars to crack cases. It is a good idea. The problem is that it doesn't stand up. some faces are subtle but mostly the difference between truth and not-truth is pretty easy to see and then it comes down to having the evidence to say "lies" or just the hunch to say "doubt". I enjoyed this at first but quickly I tired of this aspect as it was never as cool or clever as it was billed.Doing the cases involves lots of cut-scene watching – and I mean lots since this where the game occurs. You drive between them, get a bit of action here and there but mostly you're not playing. I would be fine with this if the game-play had held me more but it didn't. Crime-scenes involve walking round pushing the "investigate" button till you have all the clues, then the interviews. The cases progress even if you make mistakes and only once did I really mess up a case and this was late in the game where I was starting not to really care. The plots didn't engage me too much either – there is an overall narrative here but it didn't work that well and some cases are solved far too easily. I recall one murder case where I was really engaged in the clues and complexity, went to a grocery store, found the murder weapon on a table in an unlocked room, chased the owner, caught him, case closed – it really hurt my interest and the thought I was putting it for it to just "end" like that.Outside of interviews there will be occasional car chases and shootouts, but again these are far too easy. Shootouts are generally all over in seconds without any effort, while the car chases will eventually end if you just keep up. Also, for some reason, in the chases, you do not get to shoot, only drive – it worked really well in GTA4 to do both, but in this I'm just the silent wheelman while my partner does the cool stuff – I hope that computer controlled character enjoyed it! So in terms of the story game-play I can understand the complaints because I did start to tire of the repetitive nature of it and I stopped caring so much and the cases started feeling like going through the motions. So what else is there? Well, this is a sandbox game so in theory you should be falling over with stuff like in Fallout 3 (where I could never go anywhere without getting another quest or random event) or Red Dead (where I played poker for hours and regularly found random little events while travelling). Well in LA Noire you have 40 street crimes but these are mostly very samey. I can think of several where I drove for 5-10 minutes to get to it, shot 2 guys and it was all over in 10 seconds. You can replay them but they are scripted and the same each time – they do not feel like random events in a real city. Outside of these? Well, you have collectibles but that's it. No random encounters and no real freedom to do much beyond drive round. The game needed random street robberies – people calling for help like in Red Dead, not cut-scenes, just people. It needed more freedom to pull your gun – you cannot pull your gun out in free-roam, not at all. You cannot hurt anyone and you cannot "mess around" when bored like you did in GTA4, RDR or other of their games – with this, when you're bored, going into free-roam will not help you. The very limited free-roam essentially wastes this massive city but also means the makers didn't seem to understand what the appeal of free-roam is – its freedom, not just the freedom to drive places for no reason.LA Noire is still an impressive game though, but it is repetitive and not as clever as it thinks. The cases are linear and the free-roam is so restrictive that, beyond getting collectables, it is fairly pointless. No random events, no consequences and lots of cut-scenes. The ideas are all good and the technology impresses, but this is a first try – not the game to buy and love. If a sequel ever comes I would be there as the core of the game is good, it is just the repetition, the restrictions, the focus on scripted events and the lack of decent action sections that hurt it.;Not Informed;17 August 2011;13 out of 20 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Very unique and engaging. Really cinematic.;I finished L.A. Noire tonight and I have to say that the game lived up to my enormous expectations for it. It was such a rich and fully realized vision, the tone was perfected and all of the detail added so much depth to everything. It's one of those rare games where the story completely sucked me in and the cut scenes became just as engaging to me as the shootouts and the car chases. I really dug that each desk had it's own tone to it. Homicide was definitely the highlight for me, it had a really dark and gritty Fincher-esque tone to it that I adored. Things got a little repetitive as the game went on, particularly in the form of the interrogations, but for a game that was three discs long they did a surprisingly great job of keeping it fresh and exciting all the way through. I loved how everything came together in the end. It got so exciting seeing all of the pieces with the flashbacks and the newspaper backstory start to fall into place as the story went on.The actors were all great too, probably the best acting I've seen in a game, it helped a lot in making it feel like I was playing through an actual film or television show. My one big complaint was having to play as Jack Kelso in the end. I understood how it worked within the context of the story, but I thought it was pretty ridiculous to have us play 95% of the game as Cole Phelps and then abruptly switch us over to Kelso for that last 5%. For something like this that is so cinematic and realized, I got very attached to Phelps and it drew me out of the experience a lot having to switch to a completely different person for that last stretch. Phelp's final scene was really heartbreaking.;7/10;5 September 2011;4 out of 5 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Can We Be Honest?;The game looks, sounds, and feels great. But as far as gameplay goes? I mean who wants to repeat an interrogation over and over and over in order to narrow down the perfect line of questioning? I basically memorized all of the cutscenes because you have to retry them so much. AND HALF OF THE TIME YOU CAN ENTER QUESTIONING WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE AND THE GAME DOESNT TELL YOU. Honestly its great but its not fun, at all, unless you happen to nail your judgement.;5/10;26 September 2021;6 out of 9 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;An Honest Review;OK, yeah, I was expecting GTA in the 40s.... but then again you are a cop and that kind of limits how you can act. It's not really a free for all where you can blow through cars at a red light and drive through foot traffic to get to where you are going faster.Remember, you're a cop, property damage kind of counts against you, but injuring pedestrians certainly does... at least in the story mode. Not so much in Patrol Mode.But then... the soundtrack is amazing, both the dramatic sequences and the era appropriate radio music. The lighting (especially in Black and White mode) is superb and really feels like an old Hard Boiled detective film...... but being a Chinatown fan, I kind of went for color.And it's fun driving around 1940s LA and solving crimes. That is really where the appeal is, but if you saw "Rockstar' and "Open World" I can see there you thought GTA in the 40s.The story slowly unravels as you put crimes together, your actions, the clues you find, and the how you question suspects and witnesses all determine how well you do, and how much you botch the case... which allows you to finish a mission and really screw the pooch, avoid tailing suspects by properly interrogating them, or put more links together and turn a small crime into a big bust.If you're not into the boring detective work and the unraveling mystery, it's going to be slow and tedious for you, but if that's the kind of thing you enjoy, it will prove to be a fun and moody game.;10/10;9 November 2020;8 out of 9 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Great ode to the noir films;What can I add that others didn't already. L.A Noire is IMO currently the best detective game ever created. This game can make you feel like true investigator, with occasional chase and "shoot rm up" sequences. It pays homage to the film noirs of 40s. Visually stunning, highely detailed and atmospheric in evoking post WWII Los Angeles. Characters expressions and motions are incredibly and voice actors have done their job superbly. Lots of older (exotic) cars contemporary to the time and some of them you'll need to find to unlock. Storyline is intriguing, emotional and well written. Cole Phelps is one of the best characters that exist in a video game. For this genre ans style, what can you ask for more? The only flaw is: it's very repetitive. But again, it doesn't spoil the overall experience.;9/10;31 August 2014;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Best game I've played;When I went to read some of peoples comments, I was astonished that many people disliked this game. I thought that this was one of my most favorite/fun game I have played in a long long long time. The acting was great, with over five different actors from Mad Men. The scenery and story was very cool and fun. There were only a couple of parts that were boring, but that was it for me. This game comes with three discs of the same game. I have enjoyed every second of it. I finished the game in six days five months ago, and now I have decided to replay the game. If you miss a clue or screw up an instigation, your result could be different each time. This game takes place during the 40s, post world war II. We follow Cole Phelps, a world war II vet who is now a cop and is moving from rank to rank on the police force.SOme of the murders are harrowing, with naked women and some peoples faces are torn apart. But, you can have a selection to skip this if needed. This game might need some getting used to, but when you do, you just can not stop. I love it.;10/10;8 February 2012;13 out of 17 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;A masterpiece, but not without its flaws. GTA for adults.;Excellent cinematic atmosphere, story, soundtrack, and great characters. The interrogation gameplay was interesting, but sometimes also frustrating. At times the correct choices seemed a bit far-fetched or inconsistent, even if you were very careful. Maybe the developer pushed this gameplay mechanic a bit too hard in an attempt to keep the difficulty high enough. This prevented me from enjoying an excellent game as much as I should have. The combat also feels out of place (when gunning down hordes of nameless bad guys like in GTA) in a mature game. Flaws aside, this is still a milestone and an example of video games slowly growing up. The open world city is also amazingly authentic, arguably better (and certainly larger) than Liberty City in GTA 4. Porting from consoles was done acceptably well - you get HD textures and enough options, but there is a console checkpoint save system, 30-fps lock and a little mouse lag. Sadly Rockstar Social Club is mandatory.;8/10;16 September 2015;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Loved it: :);Graphics and acting were awesome :) your playing as a cop not a gangster or thief so if your expecting to shoot citizens you cannot as cops in real life cannot shoot at innocent citizens. i think rockstar wanted to create a realistic theme in a sense that way. i love the fact that you can free roam it tells you on the top left screen when you start the homicide case after you finish you click on streets of la so you can do the free roam look around and if your into trophies and getting everything you can do it here street crimes etc... so you can focus your main attention at your cases. I would play it again! In fact I am currently playing it for the 2nd time. I cant seem 2 get enough. I hope they come out with another one like this one. I'm hoping for one in Chicago that would b fun to see:) rockstar has another hit :)Facial scanning awesome need to do that 2 all the games :);10/10;30 May 2011;7 out of 9 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Excellent addition and homage to film noir;I got 100% and all achievements in the remastered version of LA Noire. It took me nearly 50 hours.Likes: Crazy level of detail. The map is basically the entirety of LA in 1940, which is nuts, but my favorite part is the cases. Nearly every case is based on either a real-life crime case or the plot of an old noir film. The dialogue is really interesting. The voice acting, facial expressions, and mannerisms during interrogations are done really well. You feel like you're actually solving the crimes with the detective. The script was 2,200 pages, and it shows in the fantastic execution.Dislikes: In true noir fashion, nearly every character (including the main character) is unlikable overall.Dislikes that only achievement hunters would care about: You need 5 stars on every level, which means you either need to follow a guide (which feels lame and less immersive) or you need to play through once and then replay the whole game while following a guide. The collectibles are obnoxious in such a massive map, and impossible to complete without a guide.;7/10;29 August 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition;Respect for Classic GTA Titles, Disappointment in Remake;The excitement was palpable when news of a remake surfaced. Hopes were high that the essence of the original would be preserved, allowing us to relive the joy that the classic GTA titles brought us. Alas, what we received was a disappointment beyond measure.It's not merely about clinging to the past. it's about honoring the craftsmanship and innovation that made those games monumental. The classic GTA titles were a testament to the dedication of Rockstar North, a studio that understood the intricate balance between storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and immersive world-building.As dedicated fans, we yearn to see our beloved memories treated with the respect they deserve. We acknowledge the effort that goes into every creative endeavor, but it's disheartening to witness a lack of understanding regarding what made the originals iconic.We extend this plea not as a demand, but as a sincere request to consider the profound impact these games have had on our lives. They were more than just games. they were windows into captivating worlds, narratives that sparked our imaginations, and experiences that forged lasting connections.We hold onto the hope that developers will recognize the importance of capturing the essence that endeared the classics to us. The disappointment we feel stems from a place of love and passion, a desire to see our treasured memories treated with the care they warrant.In conclusion, we stand as a collective voice of concern, but also of unwavering appreciation for the classic GTA titles. The legacy they've left is an integral part of gaming history, and we hope that future endeavors will honor and build upon that legacy.So, as we express our disappointment in the subpar remake, we also express our hope for a future where the spirit of innovation aligns harmoniously with the respect for what has come before.

Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition;Apparently I Stand Alone;Currently this game is being review bombed on several major websites, and the main reason is... some of the characters look a bit goofy..... that's it. I am aware that the PC version is somewhat broken but there is absolutely no excuse to give this game a 1 star rating on Xbox and PlayStation when the gameplay of all three classic games is the best it's ever been. The graphics as a whole are the best they've ever been. The controls are modernised and feel much better to use than the originals and the lighting is superb. It's the complete package.I believe Im one of the few who thinks this is the case and many people are furious at the games they received. I think alot of this bitterness towards the game stems from people who haven't ever played the original games or weren't even born when they came out. Many people heard "modernised controls" and instantly thought it would play exactly like GTA 5, including a cover system. In short people need to pay closer attention to what was said in the lead up to this game. Modernised controls means they changed the buttons, not make the game GTA 5, which I'm so glad because that would have ruined all of these truly excellent games.One of the things that still amazes me is that people who call themselves gamers or people who have covered the gaming industry for years or even decades still don't understand the difference between remaster and remake. Simply put, this game is a Remaster which means it's got improved graphics, lighting and some minor gameplay changes, it's not a remake which is built from the ground up with all new systems put in place, new gameplay mechanics, new additions such as missions, modes etc. This difference is key to understand and learn for future reference.Gameplay wise these games play mostly like the originals but with slightly improved aiming and much better movement, no longer do you feel like you're on ice skates when you move. This is especially good in Vice city which originally had some of the worst movement of any GTA game. One of the biggest flaws of these classic games has now been fixed and I'm really happy about it.Graphics wise as previously mentioned the lighting is superb, though I do advise before even starting a new game you go into options and set the brightness slider to max and the contrast to minimum. This makes the colors really pop and the brightness shine through where as the default settings means it's quite dark. The reflections are tremendous especially on the cars and windows of buildings and the increased level of detail on materials is outstanding. The draw distance is massively increased and this means you can see almost the entire map from certain points.The downsides: As previously mentioned certain characters don't look great, this is usually side characters for the most part but Tommy Vercetti in Vice city does look a bit odd at certain times. While I'm not a fan of the cartoonish look 'Grove street games' seems to have gone with, it does help in a game like GTA 3 where the overall look is far superior than the original, with San Andreas that becomes less prevalent in the characters and they don't look the best they probably could have, had more time and care been spent on them. I completely agree that this is something that needs to be addressed and hopefully a quick update or two can fix certain characters. Other than that there isn't anything else that springs to mind and having played all 3 games on both the Xbox Series X and PS5, they all played flawlessly without encountering any glitches in 30+ hours of gameplay. The game runs at 30 or 60FPS on next gen consoles and I've heard people complain that when in 60fps mode that the frame rate 'dips' at certain points. I haven't seen this, at least not with my eyes and would need testing equipment to see any actual drops. For me, if I can't actually see a drop in frame rate then it doesn't impact my game.There is some music missing from the originals, most notably 2 Michael Jackson songs and NWA's express yourself. While I'm not too bothered about Michael Jackson's songs I was quite disappointed that Express yourself wasn't included as this was one of the best songs from San Andreas. It's important to not get too privileged though and understand that the fees to renew these songs would have been incredible and simply more than Rockstar was willing to pay which in my opinion is understandable. Other than that all of the great songs are here and especially vice city is just a joy to listen to, it's one of the best soundtracks of any game if you ask me.Overall I think if you have actually played the original games and want that truly nostalgic feeling, all while playing the absolute best version of the games then this is the one for you. If you haven't played the originals then you're setting yourself up for failure because these games come from a generation that most who play modern games won't enjoy or even understand, some people are better sticking to GTA 5 but for me personally, I'll be playing these games for hundreds of hours to come, 9/10.;8/10;13 November 2021;22 out of 59 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition;Didn't age well;Besides the nonsense with the early bugs that will be addressed, this game is simply 17 years old. It was an absolute classic at the time but as I realized how small and simple it was, it just cannot compete with what there is to offer in 2021. You have to be a diehard GTA fan to really play this , I am watching Trevor Martin for free on YouTube, better than I could play it, and I am content.;5/10;17 November 2021;4 out of 10 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Red Dead Online;So much potential, just to be wasted!;Red dead online had so much potential from release with it having its own story missions you could play through with others, multiple different and unique types of guns and a massive open world you could spend years exploring. All of this put to waste by rock star as they continue to feed off of their golden child (GTA V/Online) and the shark cards they force players to buy. For maybe a few days or weeks you could play red dead online before the game play becomes boring quickly. Red dead online was unlike anything anyone had seen before and by all mean it is still fun but rockstar have ruined something that could of had a ton of potential by instead opting to nerf the amount of gold a person gets so it takes longer to get a role (if you dont want to waste your time you can just pay (classic rockstar)) aswell as insanely marking up the prices of guns. My recommendation is to play the online with friends and experience a story together .;6/10;14 June 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;The best Witcher experience, ever.;I had last year a Witcher marathon, playing everything from the first game to Blood & Wine. Every Witcher game is enjoyable and a real gem to its kind, while being extraordinary and quite different from the others.Witcher 1 had a unique story, Witcher 2 had the best war story, Witcher 3 had a more sentimental main story and Blood & Wine is slow-paced but rewarding. Hearts Of Stones is...well...AN INSANE EXPERIENCE INSPIRED BY FAIRYTALES AND NOT ONLY! It has the best pacing of every Witcher game, some of the most interesting characters and INSANE BOSS FIGHTS!In a nutshell, if you did not like the main campaign, get on both magnificent dlc's that are by far superior to the main story.;10/10;9 January 2018;37 out of 37 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Magnificent: One of the best games I have ever played;Wow. This game is truly astounding. I went into playing this game not really knowing what to expect, although I had heard good things about it. I have never played any of the first two Witcher games either. I have to admit, it was a weird transition from Bloodborne to the Witcher 3 because of the significant difference in pacing. However, they're two completely different games and the Witcher certainly proved itself to me. From the amazing sceneries to the engaging story, this game is definitely praiseworthy. However, the most compelling part of the story for me was definitely the characters. The character development in this game is amazing, and I truly began to feel a sense of comfort and love for nearly all of the characters. I loved the characters and lore of this game so much, in fact, that I actually played through the game multiple times, covering the main story and various side quests. It is very easy to put in over 150 hours into this game, as I have put in at least 500. Furthermore, I bought all of the books that the game series was based on and I am currently reading them with delight. If buying the entire book series simply because the game was incredible doesn't convince you that this is definitely a worthy buy, then I don't know what will. This game does not fail to impress and I can't wait for the upcoming DLCs. Hopefully you give it a shot, because it is definitely worth your time and money. Congrats to CD Projekt Red for creating such a magnificent experience with the Witcher 3.;10/10;21 October 2015;120 out of 129 found this helpful.

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;The greatest gaming experience of my life;When I finish a game, I never start it again straight away, typically leaving at least a few weeks between playthroughs. Often I never even return to it. 'The Witcher 3' was the exception. As soon as I completed it, I launched it again on Death March (i.e. very hard) difficulty, and began my journey once again. Why did I break my habit of shelving a completed game? The answer: 'The Witcher 3' has *everything*.In Geralt's third and probably final appearance as a game protagonist, we're taken on an unforgettable adventure. The basic premise of this game is actually very simple: find Ciri. Ciri is a friend of Geralt and the Kaer Morhen Witchers, and she is in grave danger when all the signs indicate that the Wild Hunt are attacking. Supporting this story, as you may expect in a fantasy RPG, is a huge number of side quests. What you may not expect, though, is just how good these can be!Whilst the Wild Hunt and the myriad other antagonists certainly contribute to 'The Witcher 3' in a brilliant way, I believe that it's the people we get to know (and reunite with, in some cases) who really bring this fantasy to life. Several supporting characters, who would almost certainly receive rather superficial and unsympathetic treatment in a lesser RPG, are written and performed incredibly vividly and imaginatively. One such character is a man you'll meet relatively early in the game - the Bloody Baron.This couldn't be done, of course, without strong writing. I'd also say, though, that Doug Cockle and the rest of the cast give some outstanding performances - arguably the best I've ever seen in a game. I admit to having never really cared much about the quality of voice acting in a video-game, but 'The Witcher 3' has raised the bar substantially.You'll connect with 'The Witcher 3', its plot and its many characters, but that isn't all this game offers. The exploration is truly great, too. From the hectic and troubled town of Novigrad, to the brutal mountains and desperate settlements of the Skellige Islands, no two places in this game are alike, and everywhere you go you'll find a story worth hearing.The game mechanics are very smooth (which is important in some boss fights!), and the interface is accessible for people who don't really care to learn the intricacies of potions, crafting, augmentation and the like.Overall, this game has provided the most incredible gaming experience I've ever participated in, and I recommend this to... just about everyone!;10/10;21 February 2017;65 out of 73 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;My favorite game of this generation;It's such an amazing experience with tons of quests and stuff to do in it's world, you literally live in it for a good 150 hours (with the expansion packs) yet still it's possible to miss out on some things and you will be quite sad when it's all over.it has one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard in any video game, from sad and beautiful to epic and bone chilling and the background music not only makes it more immersive but feels like you are right at home.the characters feel alive and realistic and what you choose to say to them will actually effect the outcome of the game eventually, side quests in this game have character and story arc's better than most games out there, the mini game (gwent) is so good an easy to learn you will spend hours on it alone and so on...the only problem in this game are the bugs but if you get the goty or complete edition you'll be good to go because it's the definitive versions of the game and it has little to no bugs plus all the must have dlc's of the game. 10/10 one of the greatest experiences you can ever have with a videogame.;10/10;25 February 2019;36 out of 39 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Masterpiece;Greetings from Lithuania.Oh, my, God. What a game, What an adventure. "The Witcher III" is easily the best game not only in 2015, it is one of the few very best games i have ever played. To write about all ~100 hours + that i have played through till finishing the story would need more then 1 page, so i try to be short as possible.Probably never before i was captivated by open world then in this game. It is huge. And i mean HUGE! There a tons of activities, and every one of them is interesting, it keeps you going further, explore and etc. Gameplay is outstanding. Fights are incredibly done, they are brutal, so as this world. Graphics are amazing. Music! What a score and especially during battles - great stuff. Voice acting was superb by all involved. Just to thing how much effort was put into creating every single thing and detail in this game is mind blowing. To be honest i wasn't a fan of "Witcher II", haven't even played the first one. But after finishing "Wild Hunt" i can safely say - count me in for (hopefuly) next installments. This is simply one of the very best games ever created.Overall, "The Witcher III: Wild Hunt" is a masterpiece. I do not use this word usually, but in this case it is the one that perfectly summarize this experience. Own this game no matter what genres do you prefer - this is a perfect game for everyone. Masterpiece.;10/10;16 February 2016;86 out of 99 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;The Wild Hunt is a Wild Ride, In a Wild, Cruel World;"How do you like that silver?" - Geralt of RiviaI, for one, like that silver. If I were a monster about to be slain, I would at least like it to be Geralt to slay me, and to hear those words... (Okay, that sounded better in my head).Anyone, this is a gorgeous and lively game, saying the least. And it is a grower. I initially thought that this game was good, but somewhat boring. It just didn't click, I felt it overrated, and I ended up leaving it for a while due to loss of interest. But I came back to it, and it is one of the best decisions I've made. My increased liking didn't come immediately, but over time, this game has worked its way up to earning a 10/10 from me, to becoming my favorite open world game, to becoming my favorite video game, period. It is definitely a game you'll have to get used to first, especially if you have never played any other Witcher game. But if you give it time, you may realize what a piece of art and amazing achievement this is.As mentioned before, this game is gorgeous. Sure, its graphics aren't the most realistic when compared to other games, but it still looks so believable and so detailed. And once the fantasy elements kick in, it is some of the best imagination put into a video game. There are numerous kinds of creatures apart from humans, both docile and hostile. The open world itself is huge and has tons of various places to explore, from plains, to mountains, to actual kingdoms and villages. Each of those places looks inspired by some civilization in history, with its own spin, of course. And the variety between experiencing friendly and unfriendly societies throughout the journey is quite noticeable. Speaking of which, the main journey is 40-50 hours, with the entire game giving nearly 200 hours. Now that is an adventure, and not in the way where there will be actual grinding. There actually is A LOT of content, pretty well-varied.The story is among the most epic and well-written I have ever experienced. As a die-hard Uncharted fan, I struggled to find as much enjoyment in other single-player stories as Uncharted. But I started to find those in Batman: Arkham, Infamous, and of course, this game. The characters are among the best I have seen, and I deeply cared for each one. That doesn't happen often. Each character is different and likeable in their own ways, and almost anyone you meet is also a badass in combat, whether they're a sorcerer/sorceress, warrior, or even a witcher like you.The quests themselves are also great, obviously. I was so sad to see the main quest come to an end when I beat it. Even though I got the happiest ending out of all the possible endings (same with the DLCs), I felt empty. That's how great it was. It often changes between tense dialogue, intense action, humor, mystery, and laid-back downtime with those Geralt area as family. Hardly did any of it feel repetitive. And the side quests themselves are a fun ride. Instead of being shallow side activities, those quests have their own stories too, and there is a wide range of that. Some can be simple and trivial, while others involve eliminating a group of bandits or a dangerous monster. If you want to be guaranteed to hunt down and kill a monster, look no further than witcher contracts, which are sure to give you generous rewards afterwards, in addition.And of course, the gameplay itself is super fun. I feel the combat system fluid, and it is a unique type, mixing magic and swordplay. That already sounds like Dark Souls, but I doubt it is the same (haven't play Dark Souls, so I don't know). But it is unique nonetheless. Upon exploring the vast world, you have a horse to travel with, and activities other than quests include clearing out bandit camps, saving people in distress, finding hidden treasure, competing in horse races, and more. There is much to do and so much to find. And the bosses are epic as well. The may not be the most challenging, but some certainly are a challenge.I could go on and on about why I got so hooked with this game. There is so much to say about it, and I couldn't think of any flaws, besides the long loading times. The amount of work CDPR put into this just feels like they spoil us gamers, especially with the two DLC packs feeling like full games on their own. This is my first single-player game where I passed the 100-hour mark and I still feel like I have much to do. Again, I'm so glad I allowed myself the opportunity to give this game a second chance, because I would have really misses out. Given that, I pity anyone who hasn't played this yet. It is not just a game, but an immersive experience, a really good one at that.;10/10;21 May 2019;31 out of 34 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Brilliant...Simply brilliant! ,,Return of The King" of video game history;Ever since the Lord of The Rings trilogy, I've said to myself that I will never see anything so epic that will be remembered for generations to come. It's a rare thing these days that something can leave such a strong impression on it's fans and usually shape their emotions from time to time. Fortunately, I was wrong. Witcher 3 is a not only a great video game when it comes to story and gameplay, it simply stands as it's own type of masterpiece which words cannot describe how good it is. With the first Witcher being a solid start for the franchise to introduce the newcomers to the witcher universe and Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings being a great sequel which fixed the mistakes of the first game and adding more debt to the story and plot progression, Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt is an epic conclusion to an epic saga (much like Return of The King) which started out from a lesser known book series in Poland to a mainstream video game franchise known by many fans worldwide. Just like the previous games, you are the Butcher of Blaviken, the White Wolf, the Witcher and none other than Geralt of Rivia. You start your journey as you and Vesemir search the White Orchard looking for Yennefer, asking around the townsfolk, while the war between Nilfgaard and Redania wages on. You get a contract by the Nilfgaardians to find and kill a Royal Griffin in order to get informations about Yennefer's whereabouts. Once you complete the task you will encounter the Bandits of Velen who work under the leadership of the Bloody Baron Philip Strenger, thus deciding whether to fight them or stay calm during their offensive babble. After you've finished your time with the Baron's henchmen, the Nilfgaardians will await you under the guidance of Yennefer, who had heard of a Witcher who came to White Orchard. In the meantime, you will be escorted to Vizima while being pursued by the Wild Hunt's Red Riders. Once you arrive, you will learn from Emhyr Var Emreis that his daughter Cirilla has returned, and that she is being chased by the Wild Hunt. It is up to you to search the leads of Velen, Novigrad and eventually Skellige to find Ciri and save her from the wretched Wraiths/Elves of Aen Seidhe, while ecountering other interesting quests along the road, taking you to a much highter level as you progress. This is enough informations you need to be aware of what's going on, so I'll be generous not to spoil some parts of story and spit it all out, because it's up to you to begin the adventure and tell it your own way as you make decisions throughout the game. The best thing about this game, is that it never fails to amaze and keep you motivated as you progress, learning plenty of things along the way, and maybe playing a round of Gwent to take a break from ,,Killing monsters"... I'm glad that Geralt of Rivia has survived many difficult situations and managed to come out alive in the end, and I am proud of CD Projekt Red for finally putting his fighting days to rest and ended his story on a high note. I hope this review has helped a bit and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.;10/10;30 April 2018;30 out of 33 found this helpful.

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Massively overrated!!!;So I bought this game expecting to play something truly transcendent. After all, this game has a better rating than Skyrim (which I hold as the golden standard for most video games and all action fantasy). I was sorely disappointed. The things that irked me the most were there graphics, fluidity of gameplay, lack of consistency, useless elements and lack of free world roaming. For graphics, to put it short and sweet, Skyrim destroys this game. Never once was did I go "wow". It was just meh. For fluidity of gameplay, there was multiple times through gameplay when I got stuck, primarily with the water elements. For example, how is it that your character cannot jump out of two feet of water? Geralt can do parkour but can't get out of a mud puddle. For lack of consistency I bring up the crossbow. Somehow in water it can kill enemies in one or two hits but out of water it's the equivalent of a Nerf gun. WTF. For useless elements, gwent. It's basically a massive waste of time that isn't even really that fun. The only reason to play is to get accomplishment trophies. Lastly is the lack of free world to roamability. In Skyrim, I used to just love walking around and seeing what random cave or fort or bandit camp I could come across. In Witcher, it's considered "open world" but it's about as open as a closet in an underground bunker. Overall not a bad game, but DEFINITELY not worth the praise it gets over much more deserving games.;6/10;29 August 2018;24 out of 159 found this helpful.

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;One of the best games in history;It does not matter, if you enjoy mostly RPGs or not, it does not matter where you are from, it does not matter whether you have read the books or not. This game will surely grasp you and make you love it from the start ! The story itself is the key to giving this title a 10/10. The best films, the best anecdotes and the best PC games all have something in common - the STORY has to be one of high-quality and has to sound believable /even if it might be in fanstasy setting.../ This game will tell you a story that is very very emotional and emersive, to some exent funny, to some extent sad, to some extent truly grand. And those graphics - this is one more reason to play the WITCHER 3. It is simply too amazing not to see it ! The beauty and the variety of lands, buildings, faces and moves surely is more than enough. One more thing - the minor characters are smart and never out of place. Sometimes, minor NPCs build the foundations of a game, and this time it happens with a finesse that is rarely seen. The ending is the other great Yesman if you are sitting on a table and asking yourself "Hmmmm, should I play this?". The ending is not what one might expect ... So be ready to be amazed ! Not to mention, the skill tree of the main character is pretty cool, too. The only negative feeling I had while playing this RPG was that some side quests were not so interesting and that there was too much rolling in fighting stronger enemies.;10/10;17 March 2018;15 out of 17 found this helpful.

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;RPG at its Best;On 19th May 2015, the third installment of "The Witcher" series was launched. I downloaded the same on 20th May 2015 and started playing. I have also completed "The Witcher 2 Assassin's of Kings" as well so keeping in mind the past experience I really enjoyed playing the new game. Geralt of Rivia, also known as white wolf along with Triss and Yen was a beautiful story line with scenic picturesque, excellent melody and intense fight scenes and I loved the game very much. It took me 8 days 6 hours 4 minutes 27 seconds to complete the game in all. So a total of 198 hours game play which is a lot to reach level 34. I have completed 220 quests out of which 14 quests were partly failed and one quest which was completed earlier was a failed quest after that specific quest was complete it was Cave of Dreams. Seven quests of Gwent game and five quests of horse races were not completed by me so in total there were 232 all quest including main, side and treasure hunts.

CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;An honest review from someone who absolutely loved Witcher 3;... expected a similar experience. I promised I would alter this review once I have played through, and I have a few things to add. I won't spoil any particular story moments if you still want to read it, but I'll tell you why I'm not happy with the way it ends. First of all, I'm usually a completionist (Ghost of Tsushima, Witcher 3, God of War) but I finished the game here after roughly 48 hours. With some side gigs done (not very interesting but gives eddies), all side quests and all main quests. This is, honestly, very short for an open world RPG. I heard it from someone else before, that it's short, but I didn't believe it until I played it. I personally can't fathom how another youtuber accumulated 120 hrs, because I personally have no interest in clearing out the map - it's just not interesting enough past the side and main quests.PROS: The main story is witten really well, very interesting - and I'm basically playing the game for itMost of the characters and their backgrounds are enticing (Jackie, Delamain, Johnny Silverhand, Evelyn Parker, Alt, Rogue, Kerry).A couple of great protagonists disappear early on! The graphics are great on a top-end PC (with a 3070 and Ryzen 3900X).The music and soundtrack is top notch, outright amazing.CONS: Zombie NPCs / AI and idiotic trafficSo much less "impactful" and "quirky" side quests in comparison to Witcher 3. It also really needs some lightheartedness.The world feels just grim. And bland, and empty. I expected there to be more dazzling, over-the-top parts of the city (eg insane holograms) and buildings that are stunning, and more distinction between the districts. But everything looks very similar, it could just be another American city like Las Vegas.I expected to run into interesting stories randomly while exploring the map, but I haven't yet.V is overall a less likeable/iconic character than Geralt. Even if you come from corpo, you still end up with a weird "V street slang" as if V was meant to just be a streetkid - they should have just stuck to a more neutral way of talking.Customisation: is basically non existent. There is way too little unique clothing, and you can't mod your character visually. Even though "style" was part of CDPR's advertisement.You also rarely get to see your character in cutscenes - except when you take a screenshot which is a bit of a shameRomance: The options are a bit underwhelming, especially River Wards questline. He fell a bit short in comparison to the other two main ones and it was a bit rushed. I would have also expected more significant options, aside from River/Panam/Judy.A few too many bugs, considering how much time they had to polish. Which suggests to me they were massively behind in development schedule all along.I don't feel the urge to 100% complete this game or replay it anytime soonTHE ENDING leaves much to be desired. Why? Because a lot of our questions aren't getting answered, no matter which ending you'll get.CDPR decided to take you back to where you started before the last mission after you finished the main story, a design choice I absolutely despise. Ghost of Tsushima did this better. heck even the Witcher 3 which was made by CDPR (even though it doesn't feel like it at times). I also can't see how they connect here in future DLCS, because the endings you can achieve for V differ greatly. THE STORY overall feels very linear. Yes, you can impact your ending and get different ones. But overall my choices or the way I played V, along with the path I came from at the start, don't really seem to matter much.CONCLUSION:CDPR is a company that can produce great games, and we all know it. People also seem to forget that this is only their second big AAA game, after the Witcher 3. They are not rockstar (yet). With Cyberpunk, I feel like they shot themselves in the foot announcing release dates that just weren't doable. They hyped up the game too much, and invested an insane amount of money and time into marketing - when they should have laid low and told us "we release it's when it's ready, 2021". This is entirely, and I mean entirely, on the management and leadership (CEO) of CDPR. I assume it was just greed for money, nothing more or less. The devs had worked hard and deserved better, like us gamers.Don't get me wrong. Cyberpunk is a good, enjoyable game, but nothing extraordinary like The Witcher 3. It basically plays like it wasn't ready to be released, and a lot of things were rushed. It almost feels like it got released a year too early. They promised us content that just isn't in the game, and I expected much more open world RPG.I think they should scratch the whole multiplayer plans, and polish it, and give us banging DLCs like in the Witcher. Where Heart of Stone and Blood and Wine were better than the main game.And the biggest thing is: Learn from this release. Improve. Re-structure your company. Give us games in the future like Witcher 3, God of War, and Red Dead Redemption. We'll get over it.;7/10;13 December 2020;85 out of 110 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Cyberpunk 2077: Masterful storytelling hold down by its flaws;TLDR: 83/100 (probably going up after patches similarly to The Witcher 3)Preface:Cyberpunk 2077 was among the most highly anticipated games in history. Its brought to us by the same developers of the Witcher games which, in addition to the casting of Keanu "Breathtaking" Reeves, is probably what made this game as hyped as it was. With all this hype this game was destined to be a failure for some, for me however it was probably the best gaming experience I have had all year. Despite the amazing writing it is just average in some of its "RPG" parts, this did not hinder my enjoyment much, but it might lower yours significantly.Story and Characters:Main Story:Cyberpunk's Main story (around 25 hours) is relatively short, especially when looking at the Witcher 3 with its around 50 hours. The biggest weak point of the story is the first act. It mostly just serves as setup for the main story and introduction to the world, this is also where your chosen live path only ever plays a major role, which is somewhat disappointing. After this pretty generic 3-4 hour long introduction the story jumps to its high point and stays there for its entire run, it's an incredible story where you as V get to decide how it plays out. Once starting the second act you will stay at the edge of your seat throughout the entire journey. The ending is an emotional banger, and it does not really matter what ending you get, V's fate is always a punch in the gut, always fitting with the classic themes of the Cyberpunk Genre and the World of Night City. Another detail i find fascinating is that the name of every quest is the name of a song and said song matches the tone of the quest pretty well. Chopin for the final was such a fitting choice.Side Stories:The side quests are where Cyberpunk truly manages to outdo most games I have played prior. If you read this right now and have yet to play/finish this game, go play through the side missions even if they seem meaningless at first most develop into mind-boggling stories that show what kind of bleak future for the human race is prophesied here. The side quests always end with though moral choices, they also further the understanding of Night City and how AI "lives" in it (Delemain quest line or "Coin Operated Boy") to a disturbing look at Night City's politics in "Dream on". Not to even mention the more personal quest that are equally as amazing, especially the four main ones with one romance option in each (depending on the gender of your charatcer).Those often surprising developments lead me to always do every side quest. You never know if the basic "kill x" side quest you just started develops into the best quest of the game. There is also some foreshadowing in some side quests, adding greatly to the replayability of the game.The Side quests also majorly influence the endings you can achieve, doing some side quests will open up 5 more possible endings. You are free to rush, only playing the main story, but also can experience the game in its entirety and get something totally different as a ending.Characters:The Characters are the heart of the game. The story is great and raises interesting points regarding AI, our possible future and body modification, but the characters in this grim world are what makes the ending so emotional especially with what happens while the credits roll.However, V, is the in my opinion worst written one. The 3 live paths did introduce you to him but never really gave huge insights to any bits of his past. Every other character is believable, and you get to know them greatly, from goals, past to personal struggles you get to know everything about the people living in and around Night City.The Characters of Cyberpunk 2077 are more than you might expect at first glance, the most prominent example here is clearly the man, the myth, the legend Johnny Silverhand. He is also the character most prominent throughout the story and the one that undergoes the most surprising but amazing development. The others are not much different though, they all are so well fleshed out and developed that once that ending hits, it really it's hard.Gameplay and SoundCombat with balancing issues Its all up to you how to approach a mission, you can just run and gun, hack the enemy into killing himself or bring out your blades from inside your arms. Across the board everything here is pretty average and not groundbreaking in any way, the game is clearly not about the combat and more about the story, the amount of variety however does make up for it. A huge problem for the combat is that the different aspects are not that well-balanced in my opinion. Melee and Hacking/Stealth feels way too strong. Another problem is that missions turn from hard to very easy in no time at all and even turning the difficulty to the highest level does not make them more challenging.Leveling up:They handled the role-playing features very well in my opinion. There are attributes and perks. Attributes are here more major while perks are more specific. The Attribute points are sparse, and you can't get all maxed out. That further increases the replay value since you can't get your Attribute points back. Always trying different builds will be one of the main reasons to replay this game.Sound:The pretty average gunplay gets compensated here. The Gun sounds are what makes the combat fun pair that with the banger that is this games soundtrack, and you will have fun just shooting up some cyberpsychos. The Voice acting is also top-notch.The AI Its just bad. Nothing more to say, it surely is a downgrade from games that came out a couple of years ago.The World: Night CityOpen World: Atmospheric but not the next GTA CDPR's worlds were always about stories and not about you interacting a lot with it. What you experience in this game you experience in the quests, not in any side activities. There is not much interaction with the world. Its mostly a stage for the characters to play on. You have an apartment, but it does not feel like "home" because you just can't do anything with it. Just don't go in it expecting it to be a Rockstar game, because it is not. However, the atmosphere in Night City is amazing, driving through the rain as never been better in any game i have ever played. Its also very detailed, you know by looking around in which district you are, what people live here and how they live.Visuals Its stunningly beautiful. My old GPU really surprised me with how good games can still look with it. The Photo mode also is a great addition to really capture the beauty of Night City. Its not well optimized though, it does run relatively smooth but dips below 40 fps at times. Even on moderate settings.Technical ProblemsIt seems the ones i had were relatively mild but still decreasing the enjoyment to some little extend.Especially when i had to reload just because i got stuck with a quest which happened at least 3-4 times. Technically speaking its clearly a mess but the same was Witcher 3 and look how that turned out!Wrapping it up Despite all the flaws that this game indeed has. The miserable AI, the lack of interaction with the world (even The Witcher 3 had Gwent) and the balancing issues, just to name the biggest ones. It has Groundbreaking characters, themes and stories to carry the game. Pair that with the beautiful world that is Night City you get a Breathtaking game that is worth every penny i paid for it.The games foundation is superb, it just needs some more work and neat extra features and its a contender for my personal top games of all time.;8/10;26 December 2020;34 out of 43 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Great game except for one little thing;I'm aware that I'm playing it on the Xbox One and my processing power is not up to where it should be for that seamless experience. This game is meant for Next Gen consoles, which is a struggle since not everyone can afford or even get a new system with them selling out like crazy. Gameplay wise the exploration and depth is fantastic and the blurriness of an Xbox One vs the new systems, is distracting but not a deal breaker. What is frustrating is how many times I've crashed and have had to redo missions but that also gives a fun change to approach the same mission in a new way. It's a complete, polished, and super detailed game but I wish it would run better on Xbox One and PS4.;9/10;10 December 2020;61 out of 103 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;A great game with a terrible release.;Cyberpunk had one of the worst releases of all time. It had so much bugs and glitches that it was barely playable. But after a while majority of it was all fixed and that was when I got it. And after playing thought the game it's not that bad it's has a compelling story with some Beautiful graphics the open world feels alive and the combat is not that bad you basically become an unstoppable killing machine by the end of the game. Keanu Reeves was one of the best parts of the game he is with you all though out the story. The game also has it's own choice wheel where you pick what your character says and the choices you pick will affect the story as a hole. The game has about 6 different endings so there is always a reason to replay the game. There is tons of additional content to do after the game with tons of side quests and collectables to find. The game also lets you select your origin story and that will make different characters react to you differently and you can only meet certain characters depending on your origin story. Overall the game is not bad it just had a bad release I would recommend to play it now as the game is not that bad anymore.;10/10;13 August 2022;33 out of 38 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;REDEMPTION;For me, this game has completely redeemed itself.From playing it at launch I was thoroughly disappointed. With all the glitches and bugs I just kept forcing myself to enjoy it, but I've given it another go on Xbox Series S and it is like a brand new game. I feel like this is what the game was supposed to be like when it first got released. The graphics are smooth, no bugs/glitches. you get the odd visual glitch where something won't render in but for me that is very rare. I'm loving this game at the moment and I'm starting a brand new save for the third time now. Give this game the hype it deserves.;10/10;27 December 2021;24 out of 29 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Masterpiece;This game is not just a game to me. The world feels alive and so does every character in the story and side stories. Truly alive and fantastic. I've played countless games in my life but this experience changed my life. I changed my life path in real life due to this game. I know it's just a stupid video game how can it be so amazing?! Yeah I have no idea. I can't put it into words but this is such an immersive and mature game. It is funny and emotional and real, raw and deep. I love being in the world of this game. I love replaying this game which I never do usually. This game makes me feel things and that is quite an accomplishment trust me :). Every inch of this game and its world is interesting to me and playing through the story doesn't feel like you're doing missions like in most games but it feels like a natural progression and unfolding of a complex and unprecedentely deep narrative. There is also such an incredible feeling of evolution in the story. once you think you know what the stakes and direction are going to be the game throws something completely unexpected at you which changes your adventure and investment in this new adventure. In short: this is my favorite game out of all of the games I've ever played.;10/10;28 September 2023;9 out of 11 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Excellent;This game is.... well, AMAZING. The wait was worth it, even though it did kinda suck... We have great graphics with an overall great story (and Keanu Reeves which is just another plus). Thus far I have no complaints.;10/10;10 December 2020;63 out of 112 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Changed my mind :) After negative review;Uh, man do I need to take back my words. After writing negative review a took time to play through again and noticed what made me loose track of the game story. After secind play I've noticed you need to follow certain "rules". For example - if you want one route you need to finish specific quests and stick with a certain path. If you jump from mission to mission things can become unlogical and detached in terms of story. Game is good, much much better than I first thought. No matter the ending (except the pistol one), all endings are interesting. You just stick with one storyline, don't jump here and there, and it will make sense. The game is both straight forward or chaotic since everything is there for you to play but if you for example stick with Panams track or Rouge, you get logical storyline.;10/10;6 November 2022;12 out of 17 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;I wish they delayed it further back;CyberPunk 2077 is one of the most immersive games I've played in the past year, it is also the buggiest game I've played in a long time. The game doesn't feel finished, it has pop in issues, cars blowing up for no reason, I can't see my own guns half the time, I've seen more trees in the game than I have in real life, that is exaggerated but I can see trees across the world from me as they exist on this plane of sight that is jaw dropping in it's stupidity and also in my 25 hours of gameplay I've experienced 5 crashes. I'm amazed as to how a game can be in development for so long and turn out this way and I can't recommend it at the current $60 asking price for PC. I can't imagine what it's like on console. I would pass until they've fixed the bugs and issues that are in the game.;6/10;13 December 2020;50 out of 65 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;A savage reception that needs a fairer perspective - credit where it's due;Its a crying shame that the release of this game was faced with so many bugs, problems, issues and mess ups that detract from the sheer brilliance of this game. I've been blown away by Cyberpunk 2077. I was fortunate not to experience many of the issues that other users have had, only minor, comical on occasion, mishaps, but despite this I was enthralled by its virtues throughout. I didn't get too bogged damn in the usually monogamy of the filler content standard in games such as this, delving instead into the storyline and was hooked immediately. Got to say, this was written like nothing I've seen on TV, games or many of the movies that get so much hype today - exceeding them all, truly masterful. Acting by the cast is spot on. I'm not exaggerating at all, the story, characters and script of the main story line (and associated side quests) are phenomenal. What a reward to see the less bleak storyline finales play out because the bad, twisted and quite frankly horrifying epilogues chilled me to the bone. I'm gutted that the developers (and co) were pushed for completion so recklessly, resulting in commitments that didn't allow for the end user experience promised. Gutted mainly because the subsequent reception generally ignore or detract from the amazing wonders Cyberpunk has achieved. I was fortunate. my experience was epic. The gameplay, sound, the pace superb, the depth of character development, the investment of the numerous people that cohabitate the rich world of night city really left me moved and satisfied with the experience. The things they did get right are incredible. I spent hours marvelling at the intricacy and sheer ambition of the cityscape, the raunchy ads that give a disturbing possibility of the status quo to come, the dystopian savagery of one very possible future the next generation may experience. I'm blown away by this title. What an experience. I truly hope all the hardship the development team has faced eases and is replaced with the respect and credit they deserve.;8/10;27 January 2021;9 out of 12 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Excellent story/characters/quests, flawed sandbox;I'd put the Witcher 3 up there with my top ten games of all times, a serious contender for the best written RPG I've ever played, competing against Planescape: Torment and Knights of the Old Republic 2.After the triumph of Wild Hunt, the hype for this new release of CD Projekt RED was insane, which is leading to strongly mixed reactions. Eight MILLION preorders is an incredible result. however, a certain part of the fandom seems to be receiving this as well as the last season of Game of Thrones, churning out scornful memes at impressive speed.I've read console versions have important issues in terms of visuals and stability. On my PC no complaints on the matter, the game looks neat and I've encountered no major bugs.More than a cyberpunk Witcher 3, however, this feels like Deus Ex: Night City.Writing is typically fine, both in the main and secondary quests, with memorable characters and solid dialogues anchored by strong voice acting. CD Projekt RED has a knack for creating NPCs far more interesting than the usual quest-delivering puppets.What doesn't work? Well, the open world sandbox element of the game lacks immersion and feels rushed compared to, say, Red Dead Redemption 2, which came out two years ago. Night City is vast and looks impressive (I particularly like its verticality) but kinda feels empty, because NPC (and vehicle) AI is lacking and, well, there's not a lot to do other than quests. Some features reek of cutting corners, like the awful police AI: when a crime is committed a bunch of angry cops will spawn behind you like law-enforcing, trigger-happy ghosts and start shooting. It's so rough compared to the sophisticated reactions of lawmen in RDR2.My advice: if you liked, say, Deus Ex: Human Revolution and want to play this on PC for the story and characters, Cyberpunk is strongly recommended. If you crave an immersive sandbox cyberpunk experience ("GTA 2077: Blade Runner"), wait for new patches and see.;7/10;13 December 2020;24 out of 38 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;A technical Disaster on Consoles;Playing it on PS4, i decided to buy it for PS4 because i was hyped like never before, but i have should waited for PS5, it's unplayable, it feels and looks like a 10 year old game... i will wait for the free Upgrade to play it... P.s.: sorry for my english, i'm not a native speaker, but wanted to write it in english to reach more people.;1/10;10 December 2020;103 out of 172 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Better than I expected and hoped;Just imagine, waiting for the game to come out for eight years, and when it does it exceeds all your expectations. There was an indescribable feeling when I just turned it on. Honestly, I actually cried. This is exactly what I wanted to see. Incredible graphics, vast opportunities for the customization of your character, global detailing of the smallest and seemingly unnecessary objects, comprehensible gameplay and of course THE DIALOGUES and their INFLUENCE ON THE GAMEPLAY. At moments moments like this, you understand that you have not waited for this game for so long in vain. There have not been such a number of innovations in a single game for a very long time. This is the new generation Half-life. New engine, awesome visuals, brilliant plot. On the downside of things the game is still pretty raw, since it just came out. But, I believe, gradually, the developers will fix everything, so you shouldn't worry about that too much.;10/10;10 December 2020;57 out of 105 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Loved it!;I played this game on release after waiting through its many delays and was happy with how it turned out. For my first time going through the game I chose the Corpo life path which was very enjoyable. My main complaints about the game are the dialogue: each character talks a lot about fictional technology which can really make conversations feel long and boring, the combat: it isn't bad, it's just mediocre, the range of weapons is great the ways you can use them is as well, the hand to hand combat is dreadful(probably the worst in any game ever but it can be avoided), the bugs: now, this is everyone's biggest complaint but personally I haven't seen any game breaking bugs yet and I have played through the whole game, I have only had some minor bugs that I can laugh off. Right, the good parts of the game is definitely the story. I adore the story, it's so interesting and the fact that it can change for people is incredible, it makes the game very replay able and my ending was so satisfying. The start of the game is also great and gave and great feel for it. The middle part was alright, there was some speed bumps which can be expected when squeezing in a lot of information in a limited time. The characters are also amazing. I've heard some people say that Keanu Reeves character, Johnny Silverhand, was dry, but I loved the chemistry between him and V. The other smaller characters where great as well, especially Jackie. If the game was released without any glitches it could have been one of the many greats! 8/10 get past the frame rate and bugs and simply play for the story and characters.;8/10;29 December 2020;10 out of 15 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;A real work of art.;This review is odd. I can honestly say this game is still broken in some ways. But story wise this might just be 10/10. I played it when it was releaced, from start to finish (including 99% of extra. The game in the beginning was not that bad. People where abit to harsh. This game is huge. Every thing looking hella good. Already on release I would have gave it a 10/10. So now (if anyone is reading this)... I just played thro the entire game again. Diffrent character also a female (was a dude last time). The thing with this story, its so amazing that you make your "own" choices and the choices change the game and how it feels. Alltho you can say its all scripted, yeah ofc it is. But it does not feel like it when you play. The beginning of the game is kinda odd and feels abit rushed but thats only like 1% of the game. If you have not tryed this game and only heard the bad things its perhaps hard to understand but to me: This is one of the best games I have ever played, if not the best "Story based game" I have ever played.Maybe I will comeback in a few years and try it again. But from my 2 times playing the entire game (160+hours ingame). I can only say that this is one hell of a game. Story wise nothing comes close. Thx for reading my ramble. Have a nice day/evening/night choom.;10/10;12 November 2022;8 out of 12 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;I will stick by this games side until the day I die;Let's get one thing straight, yes this game has bugs and glitches. But that's what updates are for, to fix things. Do you think CDPR wanted to make a game full of bugs? I mean look at Fallout: New Vagas, Skyrim, and hell even the first Red Dead Redemption has many bugs. The people who worked on this took 8 years out of their live to give you entertainment they put their heart and soul into it. They didn't take the short cut like Anthem or Mass Effect: Andromeda. Give this game a chance. If you look past the bugs you'll get an incredible game with an amazing story, stunning graphics, great characters, fun combat, and a blood pumping sound track to listen as you drive in night city. The game isn't in the best place right now. But CDPR will fix it. It even might pull a "No Mans Sky." I don't care if I'm the only person to say this: I love this game.;10/10;27 July 2021;9 out of 14 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Cyberpunk 2077 Could Have Been Something Special But Its Still Pretty Good Despite the Bugs;The potential Cyberpunk 2077 had was amazing. Between the marketing material, how amazing the world looked and the hype somehow reaching another level, I pre-ordered and even bought the strategy guide. If you've been following the game, you know how things went upon launch. It was a complete horror show between the backlash from the community and all the memes and videos with some truly mind boggling glitches. CD Projekt Red's stock tanked and the game earned some special company with the infamy it created (Cyberpunk 2076 anyone?). Is it still worth picking up despite all the issues? I would say yes but with a few caveats that I will list below.Are the glitches and performance as bad as you've heard? Yes... Unfortunately they are. I was beyond excited and despite reports of the game being a buggy mess... it only delayed me playing it for a few weeks. I still was tempted enough to fire it up. It crashed on me several times and key components like environments and certain characters took minutes to render instead of being ready instantaneously. I got caught in buildings that were broken enough to let me in but the doors wouldn't open to let me out and I fell out of the map a few times. The phone segments and the driving were the worst. But as much as I could continue to just list flaw after flaw, I did just get used to it and accept it. The game is good enough to overcome and after a trial by fire period, it became an almost non-issue. It was worth it in the end but I can't blame people for being upset or returning the game.I want to get the negatives out of the way so I'll just touch on how the gameplay was overhyped. 2077 was touted as the revolution in open world RPG gaming, as the true game changer and it didn't have nearly as many features as it was advertised to have. It does have excellent elements in it but between building up your character, the missions or how interactive the world was, I had seen most of it before. With the futuristic environment, it was in some pretty packaging but most parts were familiar instead of awe inducing. It was still entertaining but it wasn't something that re-invented wheel for a sandbox mercenary game.Getting to what I did enjoy about the game, Cyberpunk does have an involving story to tell. You get to pick V's origin story (another game element that didn't matter much in the end) but his journey through his ups and downs in Night City has a lot of fun, a ton of action and some surprisingly emotional moments. While it does start with the big heist gone bad (a familiar plot beat if you've played one of these types of games before) but between his relationship with Johnny Silverhand (a fun but vocally stunted performance by Keanu Reeves) and joining up with characters like Panam, Judy, Takemura and River, there's lots to explore and enjoy with their missions and their interplay. The game has a colourful cast of characters and while the main campaign is surprisingly short, with the side missions, gigs and cyberpsycho attacks, there's more than enough content to keep you busy in Night City.The characters actually develop and change with the beats of the story, V's love/hate relationship with Johnny and their dynamic might have been the most unique element of the game. How you can affect the game's story also had an impact. It was cool to be able to take different directions, talk my way out of conflict and pick how to deal with potential friends and enemies throughout the game. While some games champion choice as part of their narrative, Cyberpunk does back up that claim. You can fail missions and the story will keep going, save a life here that can benefit you later or sneak in and out of a compound without having to touch a weapon. You can play it your way and while that's not a entirely fresh idea, it is executed well here.For all the graphical and rendering issues, this world still is beautiful when the game functions properly. Going from district to district, each part of the city is fun to interact with and has fun stylistic shifts. There's a huge disparity in Night City of who lives and works in each area, you can go from the City Center to the Badlands and the environment is completely different. You also have some cool designs from some of the gangs, the maelstrom gang being flunkies who go beyond normal cyber modification to the animals who reject the same modification and become steroid toting hulk knockoffs. There's a lot of variety in the game and you can tell there was a ton of hours put into re-imagining our world in this neon dystopia lens.Despite all the hate and the problems, Cyberpunk is still a game worth spending your time on. The story, characters and the world are worth the investment even if the game was released too early and needed to be cleaned up. I don't blame fans for being outraged, not everyone can afford a top shelf PC or a next gen console (which at this point in time is not readily available either, so if the game is primarily sold on the older systems, its reasonable for people to expect it to work). While games are rarely glitch free these days, these types of bugs are pretty hard to explain away. Give it a shot with some lowered expectations, maybe wait until they've released some of the patches to improve your experience and hopefully you can get it at a lower price point. Unless you've got some impressive gaming hardware, in that case go nuts.;8/10;14 January 2021;9 out of 14 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;A game that could've been huge.;Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that was obviously conjured up to be a huge platinum, AAA hit and that, for not totally clear reasons, it fell very short of achieving that.The best way I could describe it would be this: imagine that the game was very well thought-out, a lot of resources and creativity put into it to make sure good ideas were concepted and developed, a very solid base laid out in terms of the overarching structure and design of the whole product but that, at some point, the budget was pulled from the game and developers ordered to wrap it up for deployment in the cheapest, quickest way possible with whatever resources they had at the time.The whole game and most individual aspects of it feel wide but not deep. Everything about Cyberpunk 2077 feels fine but very few things feel fully realized.Let's take Night City, the actual place the story takes place in, as an example. When you are in the outskirts of town and you look at the city from afar, it looks majestic. When you get close to that cityscape and look the faces of those very same buildings from a close distance, things start to feel off. When you are down on street level and look up towards the tall skyscrapers all the way from below, it looks amazing but when you actually want to climb or interact with those skyscrapers, you're denied of that. At first glance, everything is nicely-modeled, detailed, realistic, intriguing and inviting but on closer inspection, disappointment takes the wheel. Even the initial quests and introductory areas really conjure up the notion that you're in a vast, unexplored world that's alive and that has a ton of things to see and experiences to enjoy. A few minutes later, however, when you actually walk down the streets of the town and are left to free roam, everything feels incredibly generic and empty. In the first firefight, the level layout is engaging, there are many tactics to approach it and there's a sense of imminent danger. When bullets start flying, you can shoot pieces of plaster and concrete off the walls really allowing you to appreciate a sophisticated and promising physics systems that would make any battle much more interesting and satisfying. Yet all of these promises get diluted very quickly and the rest of the game has nothing to do with the initial impressions.It's hard to put a finger on what exactly creates this disappointing vibe. Whatever the cause, I take a look at the game world and it's very clear that this was set up to be a huge game with a lot of content and high quality subsystems but for some reason this vision was left unrealized. All pedestrians do one thing: walk in a straight line, 90% of the buildings you can't go into, as if they were made of cardboard, highways and avenues are, at times, populated with only one or two cars and so on and so forth.This phenomenon also trickles down to the actual missions and gameplay content. Most side-missions are just 'steal that', 'hack this computer', 'kill this NPC' and they become stale, repetitive, very easily. Also, they have pretty much no impact on anything tangible other than the self-contained experience of completing that mission. Dialogues? More of the same: most conversation choices are absolutely irrelevant and seemingly penned in as an after-thought to create some illusion of player interaction and choice. Even on missions where you are required to do things stealthily, if you don't, the only consequence is the quest-giver saying "hey, you're a disappointment" but rewarding you (albeit with a bit less money) for finishing the mission and calling it complete regardless.Character development? Same deal-o. Yes, there was clearly some thought put into romance routes with different characters but all those scenarios feel like sketches of what they were meant to be. You can romance a character, have sex with them and all but confess your love for them and a couple hours later they are with you on the phone speaking distantly as if you had just met. Skill trees and character customization? Yup! There's like 10, 12 different skill trees and, save a few notable exceptions, they sure as hell don't feel like they mold or specialize your character into anything separate from any other character.Let me beat the proverbial dead horse for the last time: there's this quest, right? One of those staple secondary questlines in modern RPGs you are introduced to very early on in the game, a pursue-at-your-own-leisure type of deal. We all know the kind. In this particular one, you have to fight a bunch of different opponents in street fights and, eventually, reach a big bad boss. When you finally beat him, nothing really happens. Yes, you are given some money. Yes, one NPC says "hey, good job!", but that's it. Even the NPC that hands you the quest and keeps tabs on progress through it all says absolutely nothing at the culmination of it. It's so abrupt and anticlimactic that a lot of people took to Google in search for answers having the same thoughts: "the quest must have bugged out" or "there must be a glitch where the dialogue for the finishing of the quest didn't trigger". But no: it's just the way it is haphazardly implemented.There's definitely a pattern: the foundations for most aspects of the game are great and solid but something happened along the way and Cyberpunk 2077 became a rushed, unfinished, empty product instead of an honest labor of love. By the way, this company clearly knows how to make a hugely successful, beautiful game: they've done it with the The Witcher series. It's clearly not a matter of expertise or know-how. What's also clear is that the game was going to be bigger and better than what we actually got.Having said all this, I still believe you should play this game through, at least once, if nothing else, for the main story.From a technical standpoint, we all know the release for this game was awful and unplayable for some people, but as of today, in patch version 1.3 the game is playable. It still is glitchy and frustrating at times, but it's stable: just had literally two crashes in more than 60 or 70 hours of playtime and I could finish all content in the game without having to do crazy workarounds to finish missions (okay, maybe once).Incomplete as it might feel, what's present in Cyberpunk 2077 can be fun. Depending on the playstyle, the basic gameplay loop can be pretty rewarding for quite a few hours, particularly if you can jive with the main narrative from a storytelling point of view.Speaking of the story, I would venture to say that the main selling point of the whole shebang is the plot. It's interesting, it's more or less well narrated and structured and the interactions between the main cast and the world around them are, for the most part, compelling enough to leave you hungry for more. Hell, I'll say this: Keanu even had me in (very manly) tears a couple of times.Now for some hyper-specific personal recommendations that most people will hate, but hey, who's writing this review?1) Play the game in Japanese with English subs.Don't ask me why, but it works. I never do this in any game, but there's something about the general aesthetic of Cyberpunk 2077 that lends itself to this. Feels much closer to the anime Akira and Ghost in the Shell than Bladerunner and Total Recall. It just makes the whole experience feel much more natural, engaging and immersive than hearing the English voiceovers.2) If on PC, get the mod "Muted Markers".Default loot visibility is weird and annoying, since you have to constantly be spamming your scanner for item markers to pop up and, even so, it glitches out and you might miss important loot. This mod fixes this and is the #1 quality of life improvement I can think of.2b) If on PC, also get the mod "Annoy Me No More".Removes fall damage (come on, people have cyberlegs and can telepathically hack into stuff but they die if they drop from a 20-feet-high ledge?). Other very good quality-of-life fixes that you'll probably want to install are bundled in this very same mod as well.2c) If on PC, also get the mod "Holster by Tap". Whoever designed the holster/weapon cycling for the PC version was a sadist.3) Play a Netrunner.The whole playstyle revolves around hacking people and devices while remaining more or less away from the action. It starts out a little slow and it's a bit gear-dependant, but, after a while, the way you can control and dominate multiple enemies instantly and safely with quickhacks becomes pretty fun and unique to this game so it's probably something you want to experience to some extent in your playthrough.4) Play a time-stopping Samurai.Grab a katana, the Qiant Sandevistan Mk. 4 "Warp Dancer" cyberware (don't punch Fingers!) and 3 Sandevistan heatsinks. This is one of (if not *the* most) fun builds in the game. If on PC, there's an essential mod that really fixes the mechanics in this build to what it should've been by default: it's called "Better Melee". It contains not only fundamental fixes, but it there's also a module that gives Mantis Blade functionality (basically a leap-to-enemy attack) to any melee weapon, which makes katana builds super fun. Very highly recommended.4b) If on PC, get a trainer that has a 'no cooldown on skills' option.Being able to use your Sandevistan to time-stop constantly, combined with the "Better Melee" addon turns you into an anime Samurai. Freezing time, rushing a room slashing through and leaping to every enemy and thawing time to watch them all get dismembered simultaneously is oh-so-satisfying.6) Play a knife-throwing ninja.By default, the knife-throwing system is ridiculous and unusable, but if you're on PC you can get a mod called 'Enhanced Throwing Knives' that makes knife-throwing absolutely viable as a build and while the stealth shenanigans are not great in the game because of AI and the skill tree, it's still fun and a decent option if you prefer a less direct approach.;7/10;15 September 2021;9 out of 14 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;Worth the wait;The game was definitely worth the wait, plays and looks really good and the storyline is written really good huge props the CD Projekt red;10/10;10 December 2020;36 out of 73 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;It is playable and there is nothing completely broken, but it is also a huge buggy mess man;(REVIEWS AT LAUNCH) Honestly there isn't really a big thing that separates this game from other first person shooters. This isn't WITCHER 3, which had a huge lore and amazing world building to it. Witcher 3 has elements of other stuff but it is mostly its own thing in terms of weapons, magic, and story.Cyberpunk 2077 is basically Matrix mixed with Deus Ex, mixed with Bladerunner, mixed with Butcher Bay, and a little bit of Witcher 3's level system.The shooting is fine but I prefer Rage 2's shooting system. The one thing people will say about this game AT LAUNCH is the funny and sometimes gamebreaking glitches that happen. An example is. I plugged myself into a machine to hack it and then I froze and couldn't do anything, I've seen cars float in the air, dead bodies buried half into the cement ground, dead enemies disappearing after dying, enemies who are alive but just stand there looking at you, enemies getting their limbs stuck on a door and they begin convulsing, enemies who can disappear disappear underneath cars and get stuck there, and so much more.Oh boy, CD RED will probably fix these issues but yea, most people are right when they are talking about the problems. THIS GAME NEEDED ANOTHER 6 months - 12 months of development time. Honestly it should had never been released for PS4 & X-Box One because those are basically unplayable slideshows. This is a PC review using a GTX 2080S.The graphics are a mixed bag, the lighting, guns, and cars look good enough, but MY GOD the characters faces are a blurred mess. It seriously look like early PS3 faces. The characters tattoos are a huge ugly pixilated mess. It is unbearable to look at. The textures on the wall, candy machine, items in shop, posters all over the cities, and newpapers are completely horrible. It looks so pixilated.Overall at Launch I would say it is still a 7/10 because the world is big enough and the shooting is decent, just have a camera nearby because I have been taking pictures of glitches to show people.;7/10;11 December 2020;15 out of 29 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty;Thrilling & emotional - simply outstanding!;I've already spent many hours on the main game, completed every ending, every mission and anything there is. It was about time for the big Phantom Liberty expansion!And wow...! Phantom Liberty delivered in every way. The story of it is simply outstanding. Not even hollywood blockbuster can compete with that. If you going to play this for the first time prepare for a game full of action and an emotional rollercoaster. The main game itself was a 10/10 but with the Update 2.0 and PL, CDProjectRed really pushed it beyond amazing. I'm sure to say that we won't get an expansion this good in the next 10 years for any game.Some small bugs in there but nothing that influenced my 50 hours of playing.;10/10;10 October 2023;18 out of 19 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty;One of the greatest expansion packs ever made to an already fantastic game.;To start off i'd like to say that Cyberpunk 2077 is my favorite game of all time. Perhaps even my favorite piece of fiction. Everything about this world and its characters resonates with me, and Phantom Liberty is no different in that regard.This expansion tackles a lot of themes already present in the main game, especially with certain characters being direct parallels to already established ones, and it's executed beautifully.The soundtrack fits the world and the events that occur so well, It's hard not to get emotional just listening to it. The visuals are stunning. Just like in the main game, I found myself in photo mode regularly, it's hard to look away from the gorgeous cityscape.The world and the way it's presented was nothing short of perfect. The blimps in the sky with the pictures of the dictator(s), the huge neon screen on the side of the big skyscraper, the hanging corpses on the signs and bridges. The moment you enter Dogtown, you instantly know what kind of place you've just entered.I've also completed all of the new endings and I can confidently say all of them are beautifully written and each one of them is satisfying in its own regard. It was gut-wrenchingly hard picking which path I was going to walk.I'm so happy to see my favorite game become what it was initially intended to be."Let's light up the sky And fade into the night.";10/10;1 October 2023;35 out of 41 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty;Good expansion with flaws;This is a pretty good expansion, with a great and emotional story to add to the already emotional story of the main campaign. I think it isn't 100% needed to fully enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 (unlike Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion).There are some nice missions in this expansion, and some of the spy stuff reminded me a lot of James Bond and even a little Metal Gear Solid. The new characters are interesting and they all have two sides to them. It makes them all pretty unique.So the main story of this is pretty good, the downside is Dogtown itself. It really doesn't look any different from other parts of Night City, sure it looks a tad bit more "Mad Max" like, but it isn't like Witcher 3's Toussaint map, which was almost the completely opposite of the dark and bleak world of the main game. Dogtown isn't interesting, there isn't anything cool to do there, and I thought this expansion was gonna open up the map more towards the outer top right area (since it was blacked out in the original).Also Dogtown is extremely, extremely small, you can drive through Dogtown in maybe 30 seconds if you were to just go straight. I can't express just how tiny Dogtown is. Just imagine maybe 7 - 10 Night City blocks (squared).Anyways, it adds a new but depressing ending, multiple choice regular endings, and a few cool missions and action set pieces, especially one in an airport (that is all I'm gonna say).9/10 (I recommend fans to play this game, but casual players can probably get through Cyberpunk 2077 without going through this story);9/10;22 November 2023;6 out of 6 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty;Absolutely amazing!;I've done everything In cyberpunk, explored everywhere and ive tried to enter every building, done every mission a few times over and i can safely say this expansion is amazing, it adds to everything that made the game amazing in the first place, keanu gets more and amazing lines, idris elba does as well, some side missions had me stuck because i had to kill a character but their voice acting is so good i didnt want to. The new district is so amazing at catching a specific vibe they were going for, it makes you want to keep your gun out but even doing that is scary! And the story of the expansion is so amazing, it gets intense and adds a lot of lore, not just for V, not just for Johnny but the world too. Everything about it is amazing!;10/10;2 October 2023;14 out of 19 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty;Phantom Liberty puts spy thrillers on notice;Phantom Liberty is how you do DLC. It compliments but never erases the base game's experience. In fact, for me, Phantom Liberty's shorter, more concentrated length, themes, lighting, sound design, story, and just about every aspect completely eclipses the base game. Phantom Liberty ditches the petty grudges of mega corps and rebellions and ups the ante to the big leagues with assassination attempts on the President of the New United States of America (NUSA) and undercover operations against the tyrant of Dogtown.I cannot praise CD Projekt Red enough for just how deftly they weave espionage, thriller, and, surprisingly, horror so effortlessly that other developers should look on and take notes. Stealth, psychology, battles of sheer will, Phantom Liberty showcases newcomers Idris Elba (as Solomon Reed) and Minji Chang (as Songbird) in such spectacularly heartbreaking stories that will have you by the balls (or ovaries, and, ew, I've made myself uncomfortable).Twists, turns, you'll be exposed to it all, and, just when your nose is pressed right to the screen, CD flips from spy thriller to techno-horror and your expectations for both will never quite be the same (for this, I recommend siding with Reed when it comes, you will not be sorry). Update 2.0 for Cyberpunk 2077 was an apology for the broken state it released in, but Phantom Liberty is a promise to try and avoid those mistakes in the future. If it weren't DLC and 2023 weren't so packed with fantastic gaming experiences, Phantom Liberty would be a serious contender for Game of the Year. Heck, in some places, it still might grab that title.;10/10;5 January 2024;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty;By far the best DLC ever;I, like many people, had a bad experience with Cyberpunk 2077 during it's initial launch, but after these last three years, it's become one of my top favorite games, and Phantom Liberty takes everything I liked, and maxes it out. I can't explain how much I loved it, so try it for yourself if you're interested, there's so much fun to be had. Idris Elba is absolutely fantastic, possibly one of my favorite video game characters that I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. He's so multidimensional, and it truly adds to the realistic feelings and relationship V has with him. Phantom Liberty has so much side content as well, but I never felt overwhelmed by it, because it was always so much fun.;10/10;10 January 2024;5 out of 6 found this helpful.
CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty;A journey to remember;This game is worth every penny and worth the wait that it took to get fixed. The whole cyberpunk universe is such an amazing experience. Thank you cdproject red for fixing this game. It became one of the most amazing journeys. In a way, the cyberpunk game opens your eyes to real challenges of upcoming technologies and it makes you see first hand how society is related to technology vis-a-vis social interactions. Thank you Mike pondsmith for creating this beautiful world. I would recommend to unlock the secret ending, even if you had to play it 2 or 3 times. Lastly, i would like to point out that even though this game was released in a bad state, the phantom liberty expansion was just a proof how well CDPR were committed to this game. Huge thanks for that.;10/10;23 March 2024;2 out of 2 found this helpful.

She is very attractive and interesting. More than other DLC characters. But no...If you are thinking about buying it or not, then it's better to watch the walkthroughs and streams of this DLS.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Good/underwhelming;This was a beautifully made game. Amazing graphics, good ideas, brilliant design and colours and textures. The story was good, tedious at moments but very enjoyable. It was clever, violent, unpredictable and well paced, which is all I want from an assassins creed game. The ending was good but very unimpressive, for both animus and real world endings. Also I absolutely hate the fact that you have to buy another 3rd of the game offline. Just ridiculous, they make the add ons and extras look so interesting and conclusive and then charge you nearly what the game its self is worth to play them.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;More of the same and yet different enough to give it solid 9/10;When I compare AC Valhalla to AC Odyssey I have to admin one thing - while Odyssey represented the ancient Greece with all its beauty and "pristine", AC Valhalla represents Europe's dark ages and England in particular at ITS BEST. You can almost smell the blood & gore, the dirt, the mud, the cruelty and the darkness that ruled Europe between V and XIV century. Ubisoft simply nailed it!The graphics are incredible, I can walk England's fields for hours just watching the environment, the cities or the Roman Empire ruins. The story is griping enough to keep you hooked with memorable characters and there are more than enough side activities to perform in order to make you looking for more of "what's behind that hill" exploration. The combat is fluid and compared to previous AC games a bit different which brings some fresh air. Developing your viking settlement also brings sense into the material grind fest - i.e. plundering middle ages monasteries and also brings the feeling of a "virtual" community you're bound to.I have only few complaints such as: the voice acting - although it's traditionally good, more of the time it sounds like the actors are talking in a large hall rather than in the open field under a treeDifficulty - even at the highest difficulty, the game feels too easy - once you cover the "power" level for a certain zone and exceed it - you start simply feeling like a demigodAll in all - for me AC Valhalla is a solid 9/10 and must play for the fans of the previous games / the Witcher series;9/10;27 November 2020;6 out of 9 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;One of the Greatest Assassin's Creed Games Ever!;I've been excited for this game for a long, LONG time. This might shock you, but I really liked Origins and Odyssey. I didn't love those two games, but I can see why both of them won critical acclaim and why they went into the Game Awards for game of the year. Again, I enjoyed those games, but I don't love them. Assassin's Creed Valhalla is simply amazing and exactly what I've been looking for in this new direction they're taking this series.If you don't like RPGs, you probably won't like this game. If you don't like upgrading your character and grinding your weapons to become stronger, you probably won't like this game. If you're like me, someone who's been a fan of this franchise since Black Flag, then this is the type of game that will definitely win you over like it won me over. Assassin's Creed Valhalla is one of the greatest games in the entire franchise. I would go out my way and call it one of my favorite games of 2020.Valhalla makes you feel like a viking, but you can upgrade your character to play like an assassin. Stealth is back and better than I imagined. No, it's not the best kind of stealth and it's not just go up to somebody and assassinate him all the time. Blending in with people? Now that's what I'm talking about, and that's what was lacking from the past two games... and it looks really good.The storytelling is amazing. The gameplay and combat are great. The visuals are great on both the PS4/PS5 and the Xbox One/Xbox Series X. The voice acting is awesome (Come on... it's Cnut from The Last Kingdom playing Eivor? Who would say no?!). The music is masterful. The sound design is awesome. This game is just so awesome!Assassin's Creed Valhalla is definitely a game I recommend to every AC fan and RPG fans. It's one of the best games I've ever played in 2020, it's truly amazing. Even though, in my opinion, the Ezio games are so much better, Valhalla has enough elements to allow you to enjoy it. I wholeheartedly recommend gamers this game to play and enjoy it. 10/10. Amazing game!;10/10;10 November 2020;65 out of 103 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Fun & Engaging;I have to admit, I haven't visited the franchise in a while, as I didn't play neither of the two previous games. However, I've always been a fan of it for a while, having played 8 out of the first nine installments. As the last game I played was AC Syndicate, the new approach into a more RPG style came to me as a surprise (to be sure), but a welcome one! I am not a person who plays my games for a long time, few games can catch my attention for more than the campaign's duration, but AC Valhalla has been terribly fun, and I've just reached 50 hours of gameplay, although I'm each day more eager to continue exploring the riches of pre-unification England. For sure among the most fun I've had with any open world game. This new style brings a breath of fresh air to the franchise, opening more doors than it closes for the future of the saga. Can't wait to see what the future holds for Assassin's Creed!;10/10;6 January 2021;5 out of 6 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Very fun, recommend for everyone over 13;Storyline if very emmerse and engaging. The combat system can be better but I love it. The graphics are very good and the load times are better than in odyessy. The map is big and I didn't get bored. It doesn't feel like the map is just there for filling like in odyessy where you just get bored. The quests are pretty fun and the cities are fun to explore. I love to build my settlement and just explore the region. There are few sexual content which are mostly just missing but it's just a quick peck on the lips. I originally bought this for my son that is 12 but I enjoy playing it with him and I was playing late at night.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;A good concept lacking in execution;I have been waiting for this game all year and I'm sorry to say I'm very disappointed with it. It almost feels as though it's release was very rushed. The game is full of a lot of "nearly" moments. It nearly meets expectations with various features but falls short. Sadly, the combat is not great. Very clunky fighting. I was a huge fan of AC Odyssey and had high hopes for this game. Sadly it falls short. The worst thing is that there are so many things in this game (raids, battles...) that are so promising but certain things take away from it. The audio during battles is not great. When raiding a village, you expect to hear loud metal clashing, shouting from panicked civilians and war cries. However, the audio during battle scenes is very underwhelming, which detracts from the concept of raiding. Overall, this was a "nearly" game. With such great concepts and things to do, it "nearly" achieved them, but fell short.;6/10;16 December 2020;22 out of 28 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Not next gen;So far it's ok.To be honest it's a little boring and I dont think it's sets a good example for "next gen". I have it on Xbox Series X and I have come under multiple bugs were certain missions are unplayable. Npc animations are not the best I have seen arms moving the wrong direction, objects floating in peoples hands and arrows stuck in characters face during cut scenes. There has also been alot of sound synchronisation issues. The polish contrary to what review companies are saying is not there!The story so far is also not the best I would have liked greater character depth.Dont get me wrong I like the assasins creed universe I think the world they have created is good but so many other open world games are available and for a £60 price tag I expected a bit more.I think ubisoft like other companies should have delayed this project rather than use it a opportunity to be one of the only launch titles on boths consoles.;6/10;12 November 2020;31 out of 45 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;100+ hours opinion.;I read some comments, and think I played different game. But I guess everyone is seeing it in their own eyes. Let me start by saying this game is the worst of last three./+ Settlement upgrading and overall feel of home base. It was fun and interesting to find all these activities, to decorate it and so on. /- Shop system. How in the hell I can't see what kind of Tatoo or decoration I am buying before I buy it? /+ Weapon and Armor upgrades. Simple to understand and to use. Can use the same Axe during whole game if I want to and it won't be under powered. /- Arrows. The fact that I can't make arrows, but have to find them in the woods infuriated me more than it should have. /+ Voice acting. Played as Male. Loved it. /- Mistakes in dialog. I was called "SHE" more times than once or twice. Hard to imagine how simple things like that can slip during test runs. /+ Fighting it self. Quite simple and easy to do. Doesn't require a lot of practice. /- LOGIC This one is a big one. And I am not talking about reality VS game. Some examples:1. I climb a wall to open some gates and let my troops in, but somehow they already fighting on this side of the gates. 2. Prisoners have their weapons on them then I rescue them. I know you can do better cause in Odyssey prisoners would take weapons from racks after I freed them./+ Size. It is really big world to run around. /- MAIN story. No spoilers so won't go into details, but I was extremely disappointed how ending was.. blunt and dull. I was like: "What do you mean, "thats it?"" . /- SIGURD story. It has a big build up and felt it's gonna be something special but it as well was awkwardly disappointing. /- PRESENT story. I guess we are divided in those who like present and those who doesn't. I personally think that after Desmond they didn't find a proper idea. And now they are just holding on to it as strange identity thing, that I really hate. /+ QUEST for conquering. Most of them felt good and fun to complete. Enjoyed most of them. +/- RAID. I guess raids are like identity for Valhalla.and mostly they are fun to do. However had to load a game more than enough times to be annoyed by the bugs then could not get my crewmates to help me open door or chest. +/- SIDE quest. (Blue dots). Trying to engage you but most of them don't succeed in capturing your focus and interest. /- Hunting. the fact that i need to kill 2 or 3 hares just to get 1 hare foot is laughable, irritating and to be fair - cruel. Feels like devs decided to make ti grinding experience for those who wants to finish all hunter quests. (PS: Killed 5 black bears - didn't get fur even once.) /- Cinematic. I was so disappointed then at one point Eivor in the cinematic (and short fighting sequence that followed) was with different hair and beard style and even different color than the one I played with.Could really talk more but I think it will be enough. To summarize I will say that this game feels like no one played it after it was made, so there are so many bugs, glitches and simple mistakes that at some times I would just save and turn it off. I say that while understand that big and large games like that can't be without false. I played 100+ hours so I got my money worth for sure. However, I would not call this game triple A game. Not by the standards some other games raise today.;4/10;21 November 2020;55 out of 70 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Best one yet;Assassin's Creed Valhalla is amazing. This is the best one yet. I won't spoil it for anyone but if you love Viking's, Assassin's Creed, and war them this is the game for you. If you've ever seen the show Viking's then you will recognize some of the names in the game. From the raiding to the story this game is perfect in my opinion. You grow to love the characters and will say this is to me the best Assassin's Creed yet.;10/10;12 November 2020;8 out of 14 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;One of the best AC games in my oppinion!;This game is just awesome! Being a huge consumer of AC games (I finished AC 1, 2, 3, Black Flag, Unity, Odyssey and have 100% Syndicate and Origins) I am not disappointed by this one! Firstly, it is simply magnificent, the most beautiful to date and having an entry-level gaming pc, it holds up with high / super high graphic settings at almost constant 30 fps. However, the game keeps the same recipe in its combat gameplay as AC Origins and Odyssey (which I personally enjoy but I know that not everyone does ) so make sure you enjoy this type of gameplay, the same goes for the infiltration phases, which are rarely encouraged, in favor of a frontal attack (which is great during strong attacks, but I still miss the infiltration mechanics that we used to find before). In terms of history, I do not have a titanic progression for the moment but I can still say that for the early game the missions are well written, even if of course they do not compete against a The Witcher 3 or AC 2. The vocal interpretation of Magnus Bruun (who plays male Eivor) is in my opinion more than perfect! Finally let's talk about the world, which remains the key point of the success of ubisoft open world. It is in my opinion incredibly well done, as much for its breathtaking large-scale landscapes, its huge Saxon towns as well as the smallest details of a small abandoned hut on top of a mountain in a Norwegian fjord, this world is quite simply beautiful and alive, and knows how to surprise us and arouse our curiosity and our thirst for discovery. To conclude, if you enjoyed the gameplay of Origins and Odyssey or if you want to get started in the world of AC, this game is for you and I recommend it 100% !! However, if you are a hardcore old AC fan and have doubts about the gameplay of recent AC games, you can go your way, even if you miss the opportunity to visit in my opinion one of the most beautiful open worlds that video games have ever known (purely personal opinion).;10/10;14 November 2020;11 out of 21 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Not for everyone but a great experience;At this point Assassin's Creed has become the Fast and Furious of video games but I'm ok with that. Valhalla has an immersive story that brings in familiar music and gameplay from the beloved beginnings with new characters, stories, and freedom that is making this game the awesome game it is. I started playing as the female but changed to the male Eivor 30 hours in because while she has a good voice actor, the story does not flow well and I find it hard to become attached to female Eivor unlike playing as Kassandra in Odyssey whom I would simp for hard. My issue? There are too many places you can get your character stuck and have to reload. A few times is expected and funny but when it's consistent that's when it gets annoying. The ability tree is overwhelming at first but it gets easy to work with the more you play and discover how you are wanting to play stories and just as a dope viking assassin. There's a lot to explore and so many ways to approach every situation that it really is your way to play. It keeps me interested but I do prefer Assassin's Creed Odyssey;9/10;10 December 2020;5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Boring edition to the franchise;Yeah this one bored me. I didnt like a lot of the characters and the story just wasn't interesting unfortunately.In AC i prefer stealth play but a lot of the time you are piling in with your whole crew which takes away the assassin element.Lots to do for sure, so if you dont mind repetitive game play and like huge open worlds then this one is probably for you.;6/10;11 May 2021;7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Odyssey and origins was way better;I like it so far don't get me wrong, but this game is lacking something for it to be an actual assassins creed game. The equipment all the same, none of it has "special qualities" and if you equip a pointless rune it may or may not trigger that special rune ability, you are dependent on if you have ability stamina for abilities which yeah good luck,. Not very good really. Definitely not loving this version at all, and the DLC content, no meat to it, not worth the extra you pay for it.;8/10;4 January 2021;7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;FC Fans just don't know what they want;This is the purest Far Cry has ever been, sure it lacks in some areas, but this is definitely behind FC3 as among the best in the franchise yet. These so called die hard fans dont know what they want. The amount of content here and the world of Yara plus with Giancarlo Esposito, is amazing. Props to Ubisoft for stepping it up.;10/10;10 October 2021;26 out of 45 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;Revolution is a lie;.storyFar Cry 6 is set in the Republic of Yara. Fictional island that resemble Cuba. Our character is Dani, male or female is your personal choice and his background story is as thin as easily forgotten right after the exciting opening game's sequences. Dani is basically the tool, the Pistol of this Revolution against the new tyrant. Since Far Cry 3's Vaas, this series has been known for having great charismatic villains. This year's Far Cry has the honour of featuring Anton Castillo. His role is played by the famous Giancarlo Esposito. The Castillo family has been holding Yara in his hands for generations and thanks to Doctor Reyes invention, a drug called Viviro, the world avoid to put a word on the inner conflict between the Castillo and the rebels. Viviro is basically described as a drug that can cure cancer. Through the whole storyline we can see different characters taking over, most of them with a huge reverence on themes such as racism and LGBT+. Sometimes this all appears all over the place and out of context but we know, it's 2022, and this game wants to be inclusive even at the cost of being ridicolous. This said the game features great cut-scenes and all are pretty well acted despite the plot never really thickens and most of the villains just randomly die and Anton Castillo, like Pagan in Far Cry 4, has not much screenplay. Overall plot and characters are forgettable and just an excuse to go there and do this/that. Side-note: I have never seen so much swearing in a single game. Every single dialogue ends or begins with F words. Also it was a waste to not see Giancarlo Esposito more and with an extended role and dialogues..gameplayFar Cry is always being known for having giant maps and a shooting gameplay that doesn't take itself too seriously. FC6 unfortunately is a huge hole in the water because of bad game-design choices and a map that is too big and too empty and when you combine these two with a lot of backtracking between missions you can clearly see the fun is out of the game. Let's start by the fact that to accept a mission we need to go to the campbase each time and soonafter accepting we have to take a 5-10 minute walk in a map that is hard to navigate with a lot of verticality and a main character with no exploring skills. I said this because Dani can jump, yes, but most of the climbing is scripted and he/she cannot climb when it's not programmed to. Same goes for the grappling hook, whicht is a nice feature but hardly implemented in the course of the game. With such a huge map you expect a good placement of checkpoints and fast travels: that's not happening. More than in a handful of occasions I died and had to walk all the way back to the mission..and FC6 is probably the first time I see an open world game where I cannot change the time of the day. Let's talk about the main missions. Most of them require the player to complete basic tasks like killing a target or collecting intel. Some of them required me to find some sort of collectibles or find specific prompts that were not marked on the map, so, although I like the exploration it ended up being quite frustrating. Missions features always a similar pattern with Dani looking for something, getting ambushed, killing the horde and having to deal with a chopper or a tank that we kill with a single shot of Supremo. This is basically a special move, an Ultimate, to destroy huge threats at once. Far Cry 6 quits the good old skill tree and the outcome is a widely classic gunplay that results very stale and basic, without crazy twists that are left to just a few mods for our beloved guns. I wish they took the risk to create some more creative ones. Sure we get special weapons that fires CDs and fireworks but I liked some crazy skills as well to give some more variety and style to the game. Enemies AI is on of the worst I have ever seen with soldiers charging you with all themselves or completely forgetting you are even there. Most of the challenge lies in the fact that the game is divided using the (in)famous rank level and this might left you out some areas for some time unless you are happy to take lot of damage from dumb enemies. There are lots of checkpoints to conquest and missile bases to destroy to open flyzones but they are so boring to reach, having to walk a lot between them, that it is just not fun. Most of the mini-games are pretty common, copy pasted, unfun stuff. I am talking about race games, hunting and fishing. I really enjoyed Cockfighting though, a very easy copy of Tekken but I am sure there was a lot of controversy about it...soundVoice acting is okaish. Most of the dialogues have a bad, bad writing and are full of swearings and hardly fun or enjoyable. Anton Castillo and his Son, Diego, have probably the best depth scripts but even this doesn't shine with so many games out there focusing on great storylines..graphicsYara is gorgeous and Ubisoft did a lot of work to create a map with lots of vertical options. Far Cry 6 is one of the best optimized game for PC and it features PS controller layout and tons of accessibility options. Most of the character models are well detailed and animated and Giancarlo Esposito is simply a 1:1 game model of himself.Ubisoft tried to revive Far Cry once again but it is probably time to put it to sleep for some time. Hiring Giancarlo Esposito might have lured some people to buy in this new episode of the franchise but I am sure they have been disappointed and will think about it twice next time.;6/10;3 November 2022;5 out of 7 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;Exceeded My Expectations;Far Cry 5 was my introduction to the series when it became one of the free monthly downloads last year. I wasn't overly keen on the story but loved the open world setting and the gameplay itself. That is what got me excited for the latest release, and I have looked forward to it all year.Well I can say that it certainly is not a disappointment. Firstly, the scenery is absolutely beautiful, and has been intricately detailed, so even when you are in the back of beyond, there is always something to see or do, or a cave to explore, or wildlife to hunt, or do as I do, which is just to explore and observe the breathtaking views. Although the map is huge, every area has some kind of landmark, whether it be part of the story, or just there to explore, and does not have that empty dead space of huge maps, such as the Just Cause franchise. There has clearly been alot of effort put into the design and layout.Secondly, there are loads of weapons to choose, all individually upgradable by collecting scrap items, scattered around the map, as well as unlocking unique weapons in hidden chests. Although the upgrades don't seem as in depth as other specific first person shooting games, there is still plenty to keep the majority of players happy, not to mention the ridiculous and crazy guns you wouldn't see in any other game anyways.The vehicle choice is adequate with the usual planes, helicopters, boats, cars, trucks in previous games, but I feel they easily could have added alot more choice for a game of this size. It was nice to see the mini hovercraft, and strangely enough, horses too.As for the story, it is very long. I'm around 30 hours in and I couldn't even tell you if I'm half way through or not. But I love it so far. There are numerous characters you cross paths with, some likeable, some not so much, but they are all part of the exciting journey. There are some very nice and unique missions throughout the whole game and what I personally enjoy the most, are the ones where you have to think strategically. You cannot go in all guns blazing in every mission because you will literally die every 2 minutes. As the story progresses and enemy soldiers become harder to kill, you are almost forced to take a stealthy approach. Some players may not like that, but I really do, and I'm sure others will too. Having the ability to play co op with a friend will make a huge difference in how you handle missions, as well as being generally more fun. I have only played solo so far but had great times with friends in FC5.There is so much good to say about this game and I can't praise it enough. I would score it 10 but unfortunately it's not a perfect game for me. As good as I think it is, there are some things that prevent it from a perfect 10.The radio stations for starters are diabolical. I think there's only 3 songs that I recognise and I do love listening to good music in games.Vehicle choice as I said earlier. The white player blip/arrow on the radar is horrible, as it merges with other white icons making it a nightmare to see where you are. The game freezes intermittently for 10-15 seconds, launching your car in the air. (Could be an old gen issue). The enemy is very over powered, constantly hitting you before you can even see them. They run whilst fully locking on and shooting, randomly throw a grenade whilst shooting and you are getting hit left right and centre. It can be very frustrating, especially when you have an objective to carry out whilst fighting off endless enemies, reloading, healing, dying and restarting all over again. And the enemy spawns aren't the greatest. There is definitely room for improvement but over all I have been very impressed. I'm very excited to see how the story ends and then work through the side missions and treasure hunts. Last thing is, there are alot of haters out there putting this game down for no good reason, so if you want an honest opinion, go to a small online streamer. Those guys will tell you exactly what this game is like.;9/10;11 October 2021;16 out of 27 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;middling, don't buy at full price;I got the game on sale for twenty dollars. Finished the game at about 34 hours. Overall a competent game but it's middling and soulless. Flat and repetitive gameplay and plot. Very little endgame payoff. Very meh ending. The environment looks quite nice but the world is barely interact-able. It has all sorts of base-building and RPG elements but none of them seemed to really matter at all.On sale, I think there is enough content there to keep you occupied for some time. Only buy it when it's on discount and don't expect to be blown away. I would have been angry had I bought this game at full price.;6/10;2 June 2023;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;What More Could ya Want?;The game is super solid. Insane graphics, interactive and fairly intelligent NPC's. The plot is very well done and hardly lacks any major factors, similar to its predecessors. Mechanics are amped up a notch, Driving feels entirely new and has weight and physics to it now, Gun play is a fresh breath! Would highly recommend. Beginning is very gritty and eye opening for some, but something that draws you in to fight for what is right! Eye candy views, customizable weapons, and a croc that eats people... what more could ya want?;10/10;10 October 2021;26 out of 52 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;Weakest in the series so far;Greetings from Lithuania."Far Cry 6" (2021) is a very uneven game - at least it was for me. At the beginning first few hours were boring. Later it picked up and i started tio highly enjoy it, and even was thinking its going to be one of the best games in the series. But soon a spell went off and it ended on being so so game.Best things about this game: graphics, acting by Giancarlo Esposito, gun play and some exploration. Unique gear sets were also pretty unique for the series, but soon I was only using few of them. I did complete the story but was disappointed by it for it being to generic and predictable. Ending was pretty brutal (no spoilers), but overall it was mehhh.The worst thing about Far Cry 6 was its generic approach to basically everything. I played all parts and Ubisoft really needs to start improving this formula because it become very predictable and stiff. If they won't change things up drastically for next installment, i won't return for inevitable 7th part.Overall, "Far Cry 6" is not a bad game by any means, and at most part its a pretty good one. There are few great things about it, some OK ones, but mostly its boring and predictable. If you played any of previous instalments, you already played part 6.;7/10;6 June 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;The worst story and characters in a Far Cry game to date.;I must admit i had pretty high expectations for Far Cry 6, but i was severely disappointed by the finished product. Don't get me wrong, Far Cry 6 still features plenty of the same exploding action and beautiful nature we are used to find in the world of Far Cry, but they made a mistake when they removed the skill tree from earlier titles. It just doesn't work as well as it should. I find it annoying to change shoes, pants or headgear just to be able to do certain things. (I just ended up not using any of the features) Not to mention the fact that you have to shoot enemies 20 times to kill them if you have the "wrong ammo type for the enemy" by simply adding a feature like in Far Cry 5 where you could change the arrow for your bow on the fly it would be way better. What really killed the experience for me though, was the fact that all the characters seemed to be written for gaming journalists and the Twitter community, you know.. The worst part of the community on Twitter. Every single character was extremely annoying and very hard to like. I didn't care about any of them. I would complain about the story being so short but in this case it's a blessing.;5/10;7 November 2021;45 out of 57 found this helpful.

Feels like watching a Mexican telenovela for teenagers in Canada.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;The best ubisoft game of all time;Star Wars: Republic Commando is very special game foe me and Far Cry 6 is a very special game for me from now on. I've been playing the Far Cry series since the 3rd game and this has been my favorite among them, and I really enjoy playing the game. Especially the hitting feel is very good. You can understand what the main character is going through very well and you feel that he is a stronger character than the previous characters. But after a while, repetitive operations can be a problem for some people. Moreover Far Cry needs a new thing.The villain is also regular Far Cry villain like Pagan and Vaas. 6nd game is average of 3rd, 4nd, 5nd games but the top.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 6;Where did we go wrong...;Very concerned about Ubisoft as a company. Far Cry 3&4 are some of arguably the best games to ever hit the market but it seems they've become a version of COD where every game progresses and plays the exact same. The game has great upgrades in feel and look, but that's a requirement because of it being made more recently. Story is bland, and most importantly the villain isn't someone you dislike, which has been a staple of the far cry series. Glad I bought it on sale but I wouldn't even recommend it for that.;3/10;22 July 2022;11 out of 12 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Great City, Weak Gameplay, Unfinished Systems;Overall this is a solid Watch Dogs Games. However, the Missions are repetitive and the main villains are a bit bland. There is no character customization, besides of outfits, at all. I would love to change hair or something on my chosen characters. The biggest achievement is also the biggest issue in this game: You can recruit anyone in your team and all of them have some kind of background story. It is a great system, but it really lacks depth: You could build a whole Clone Army with the same face, only the abilities change - and this is the main aspect to choose people. However, you can also stick to one character if you want - but besides clothing you can not change a thing. So the biggest issue? You can not identify with "your" character. It is disposable and you just jump to the next one. You will not get attached at all. There is no personal history or story. All the gathering stuff is fun at first, and very similar to "The Division 2", but do not expect it to be as good as in the other game. You get text files, audio files and rare old things you can gather. Oh and some masks. Overall, even though you can get outfits and masks en masse in the game itself, it is clear that the best looking items with the best textures comes directly through the Item Shop - you can buy some ingame money, helper to show all locations of collectibles and complete unique outfits. I have to admit, I am only 30 Hours in, but I still try to find an outfit ingame - let´s hope it is not only available through cash shops items. There is btw also no way to earn any Shop Items with playing the game. Not even a gambling system or so.And doing the missions? There are 3 ways: 1. You just shoot through 2. You sneak around and subdue anyone by yourself or with the help of traps. 3. You spider your way through the mission (though have to admit you can not do all with the spider).One more thing about collectibles: Do not expect that you can listen to an audio file while walking. The System needs you to stay in the menu and on that specific file to play.And no matter when and where you go, every place is full of people. At night 3am in a small dark walkway? No worries, you are not alone and 30 people are all around you.The ingame map is ok, but also needs polish, POI´s just vanish if you are to far away and if you are to much zoomed in it gets angled to visualize a 3D Map. Needs getting used to, but needs some polish.Overall: London looks great, systems are not polished, customization options are missing, no attachment to your played character, Missions are similar and repeating after you have done the first few and only the story behind it is different.I only give 7 Stars, for the City itself and the character system they tried to build. This game is more a concept art, but sadly not finished and needs so much more finetuning. 6 Months more for these things and it should for sure get a 8 or 9 Star.;7/10;29 October 2020;21 out of 27 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Ok;It's an ok game in my opinion. I think the story is pretty boring and predictable. Before the big reveal I had already figured out who was behind the bombings. It's not a bad story but I just didn't care about it. I didn't care about the things I had to do. Didn't care about any of the characters. Such a shame cuz I think the game has great potential. When it comes to the gameplay, it gets a bit better. I think it's fun but they could have done a bit more if you ask me. All the missions are basically the same. You have to go somewhere, hack your way into a building, do the same puzzle you did every mission before this one, fight off some enemies, escape and try to loose the cops. There was I believe only one mission that was different from the rest. Best mision in the entire game.I'd give this game a 6,5. I think they could have done way more with such an interesting concept.;6/10;11 November 2020;9 out of 14 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Playable, Yet Unambitious;Watch Dogs: Legion is about as good as you'd come to expect from this series. It's not a bad game however, it is just really lazy and underdeveloped.Gameplay wise, it is very much identical to Watch Dogs 2 however it implements new features such as multiple playable characters (known as operatives) and these characters will have their own routines that they will live out (or so it feels like at first glance). To recruit an operative, you can just go up and talk to them (help them with a problem or liberate a borough if they don't like DedSec) and they will give you a mission - usually go and collect an Ambulance or protect them from an assassination attempt. They will then return the favour and join your cause. Beforehand, you can check these operatives skills and abilities (for example hitmen can carry lethal weapons and are generally more maneuverable in combat, and doctors and police officers can give you access to restricted areas) However, once you upgrade your skills from the main menu, you will only need to use certain operatives throughout most of your playthrough. Making this mechanic interesting, but underdeveloped.The game's main setting is London, the cultural capital of the world - home to many different walks of life. Which has unfortunately come to disarray after a planned terrorist attack occurs and is blamed on DedSec (the main protagonist faction of the Watch Dogs series), and the group soon disbands. It is up to you, and your operatives that you recruit and play as, to conquer London from Albion - a private, corrupt military group run by Nigel Cass (who soughts to bring down DedSec) and find out who set up DedSec for the terrorist attacks.Just to mention in this review, the voice acting in Watch Dogs: Legion is on par with Bethesda games such as Oblivion and Fallout 3. And it feels that there are even less varieties of voice actors than in those games - most of my operatives speak with an Irish accent, and there's another large group that speak in Jamaican accents. Not to mention the dialects sound too over-exaggerated for a proud member of the British Isles, such as myself.Additionally, the music in this game is nothing really to mention - it's primarily made up of UK Grime / Rap and Punk Rock. Again, not much in terms of variety.If you ask me, I'd recommend this game only to people who are interested in the Watch Dogs series, sandbox games, open world environments.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Solid game;This is a refined, well tuned experience that could make watch dogs one of Ubisoft's most popular franchises. But there is one thing, pretty important. Youtuber Ubicentral talked about this in his final impressions video. The story is dark, maybe darker than the first. But with play as anyone (which is amazingly exicuted) comes a problem. If you play as a group of grannies, or have characters with bad voice acting, the story will NOT be good. But that's my only complaint with play as anyone. No matter how much I miss the characters that made the first 2 special, it's amazing to think that a game, that was considered Ubisoft's no man sky, has made such a powerful entry into the open world shanath arena to compete with the other open world gamesEdit: here are some more things I didn't have time to say. Dying feels like it has some actual weight. Even without permadeath it's still more impactful to die here than your companions in far cry 5 because you play AS these characters. The amount of fan service in this game is just the right amount. Things like default which we all expect to Aiden, wrench, a assassins creed character, and a Iana looking chick as DLC. Can't wait for online and more in the future. Also please update the uniform system. Have enforcers that only they can notice you plz? Worth a shot.;7/10;4 November 2020;8 out of 14 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;One of the best games of 2020;During quarantine I've spent a lot of time inside playing games and replaying the watch dogs series in preperation for this game. I just have to say only 4 hours into the game and I'm like shocked by how well this game is made. You can be anyone. Everyone has a backstory. The mechanics for hacking and even strolling in London is very cool. I have to say well done ubisoft well done.;9/10;30 October 2020;25 out of 29 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;People are so used to games being in America;A review on here complains that Watchdogs legion teaches kids to subvert the government. Way to miss the point!Its the duty of citizens to question the government, its the lack of questioning that causes the takeover in the game. Now, more than ever, as Brexit comes closer, we must question. Who will take over and what are their intentions.The game is solid although I would have preferred a main protagonist, the mechanic itself is a remarkable feat, technologywise.The lore is rich if you read the text files and take in the surrounds.Like many, I guessed what was going on but its no easier than 1.Much fun can be had comparing the characters to their real life counterpartsRichard Malik- Rishi SunakEmma Childs- Cressida DickNigel Cass- Tim Spicer and AegisGoogle these people and you'll see what I mean.Watchdogs legion suffers from not showing its story through America but its time the world outside of America was shown. It may be hard to adjust but when you do you'll find a funny, dark and engaging political game;Not Informed;17 November 2020;8 out of 16 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Good idea but bad delivery (PS5);I have literally never, ever played a completed game with so many bugs. From movement of the character, to NPC behavior to number of my characters actually being outside the city upon "activation" and unable to enter, you name it. I loved the first two games so much but this was a disappointment.Also I feel that they came up with 10 dialogs and at some point it becomes so annoying to hear the same lines over and over and over and over again.One of the currencies in the game is also totally useless.You can only buy clothes with it and that also becomes annoying at some point, especially if you are playing on permadeath mode.I like the idea of building a "legion" and managing it but that is about it I like in this game.Even after all said above, if there is a new game I will give it a.go in honor of the first two. Hopefully Ubisoft will do a better job.;6/10;6 April 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Worst of the 3 Watch Dogs games;This might not be fair since I didn't complete it, but I have played some of 2, and played a lot of Watch Dogs (2014). This is the most disappointing of all of them.What I loved about the first one was the action was cinematic, the story felt gritty, and you weren't overloaded with game mechanics.Legion absolutely felt overwhelming with mechanics, no one character to identify with, jolty-as-hell movements that felt like smooth action scenes were impossible. Movements in general felt rubbery rather than impactful or cinematic.The only redeeming features was adding a little to the fighting mechanic, some of the visuals and city design, and toning down some of the cringe hackerspeak they overused in WD2. Parkour was more wack though.;3/10;30 May 2023;2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Troubled by Its Own Ambitions;I'm a big fan of the WATCH_DOGS saga. I loved the storytelling and design of the first game and absolutely adored and found myself addicted to the second game. Although, the first game and second game feel very different from one another. The series did always have a bit of an identity crisis. But Watch Dogs: Legion takes it to a whole new level. Which is unfortunate.Watch Dogs: Legion's biggest problems stem from its new additions. The recruitment system especially. The recruitment system ends up ruining the story due to the lack of a cohesive lead character and a fairly weak supporting cast. It also doesn't really spice up gameplay that much and barely does anything to add to the sandbox.The story itself, character issues aside, is actually pretty good. Not the best in the series, but I will say it's a bit stronger than Watch Dogs 2's, despite me loving that game to death. The premise and how the story unfolds, as well as the overall narrative design is quite good and compelling enough. But, again, the main characters don't pack much of a punch. The villains that you face off against are fairly entertaining, some of them comical.The gameplay is what you expect from a WATCH_DOGS game. If you ignore the poor recruitment system, Legion has some fun and occasionally challenging gameplay. It also might be the hardest WATCH_DOGS game in the series.Overall, Watch Dogs: Legion is a good game, but could've been better if its ambitious additions were a bit more fleshed or at least we'll executed.;6/10;8 July 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Watch Dogs: Legion;Watch_Dogs: Deletion;Not worth AAA price for such a shallow and short campaign. It's easily forgettable, apart from 1 or perhaps 2 missions. Graphics mean nothing to me if it isn't backed up by the gameplay and BOY! I loved WD1, WD2 was a banger of vibes but this is a major downgrade to gameplay quality (the missing underscore in the title also set off some flags). So many hacks, gone. Phone menu and apps, gone. 3D printing your arsenal, gone. I don't want to list everything, so there you have a few.Online is a buggy mess and the player base is so few that you often reencounter familiar strangers. Most of the hardcore players have stopped playing and the Online player base is now just mostly made up of newcomers. Matchmaking is a pain, where you have to wait for other players to complete up to the same mission you're on, and unless you've reset your mission progress to the beginning, it's now very rare you'll be matched.I did enjoy some of the 'you can play as anyone' system but it could do with a major boost in quality. Bloodline was good and probably the only good I got from the game. I had a 1-2 year hiatus from Ubisoft games, and they published almost Cyberpunk 2077 tier of buggy games but don't quite fix them like that game. I don't think I'm going to recover from this Buggysoft experience anytime soon.;1/10;22 November 2021;5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Weirdly addicting;3 years since Assassins creed Valhalla, AC Mirage goes back to somewhat of its roots with the toned down rpg elements and more approaches of stealth. However it does feel like I'm just playing a re skin of Origins. Baghdad, while beautiful on my console is just boring.The dialogue is atrocious. I hope they get new writers for the next game because the acting and dialogue is just plain awful. You can tell they're not even trying to act. Character animations seem like they haven't been worked on since origins. Hopefully this is the last of this engine because I don't feel any emotional attachment to characters that are blatant npcs. Unlike Ezio and his family.There's loads of parkour options but the buildings aren't as tall as previous games and there's no giant monuments like pyramids. Although I do like the smaller map. It feels like I don't need to just fast travel everywhere.The combat is very clunky, the standard enemies are fine and perfectly balanced however the fast bounty hunters are almost impossible with their incredibly fast attacks and insane damage. Brutes are easy to kill with a few dodges.;8/10;12 October 2023;13 out of 20 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;A Step In The Right Direction;This entry in the Assassin's Creed franchise provides a fairly compelling answer to the question of what a modern take on the gameplay style beloved by many from the classic AC titles would look like. Save for some clunkiness in the melee combat mechanics, the hybrid model works quite well. although, I would still like to see the scales tip slightly more classic if they attempt this style of game again (and I hope they do).The game's biggest weakness is its story, but that seems to be a side-effect of its short length. With more screen time to flesh out the side characters and get to know the allies and villains of the game, they and the plot itself could have all been more compelling. As it stands now, Mirage's narrative is a nice extra chapter in Basim's story to supplement his character arc in AC: Valhalla, but this story on its own does not contain nearly as much substance as the earlier games it is paying homage to with its mechanics.All told, Mirage is a good game that's worth playing if you're a fan of classic Assassin's Creed. If Ubisoft continues to refine this new take on the formula over future instalments, I would be happy to continue playing them.;8/10;16 October 2023;11 out of 20 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Keep trying Ubisoft, you're on a good path;I was too excited about this game, hoping that Ubisoft finally decided to go back to its roots and give us the good old Assassin's Creed. But my excitement waned after the first few hours of play. Although, unlike Odyssey and Valhalla, Mirage brought a much smaller map and a not so boring environment with RPG elements ... but too many bugs, boring story and lackluster missions simply decided to give this rating. It's unbelievable that after 15 years Ubisoft can't recognize that they have gold in their hands and commit to making a game worth paying attention to. If they don't already have the talent and good writers who will make a good story, then they can simply go back to the past and use the old formula and make a good game. The only good thing left in Mirage is that there is more focus on stealth missions and a more closed type of map than on a large open world and rpg style gameplay. The graphics of the world are well done and really look beautiful, but the characters look like they are from the Playstation 3 era. The bugs annoyed me a lot and there are a lot of them on PS5 (I don't know what the situation is on other platforms) and that's why I repeatedly wanted to I stop playing. For example, it often happened to me that I would go to a merchant or a blacksmith to do something and I just couldn't click to interact. Likewise, in some missions I had to interact with NPCs, but for some reason it was not possible, so I had to reset the mission or do something else and return to the mission to continue. The combat is very clunky and the enemies are very stupid. What disappointed me the most was the story, totally without any imagination... boring! I would like one day Ubisoft to team up with Naughty Dog on at least one project and make a good story in AC games... The only thing that makes me happy, in the end, is that AC followed in the old footsteps and that maybe in the future we will play the good old ones Assassin's Creed. Not to forget, thumbs up to Ubisoft for not charging full price, the game cost $50.;6/10;23 October 2023;6 out of 12 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;So "'wannabe old and classic AC game" that becomes more a copy than game;I had expectations for this game. I really did. And here is an honest review form a person that supports Ubisoft that likes the rpg games and every ac game. This game feels so boring that I didn't even bother to finish it. I never write a review for something if I haven't finish it.. But it's the first time in my life that I feel I have really better games to play. And you know something is wrong when you feel you are wasting your time from the first 5 hours. And I see that other reviews match my opinion on the topic. Mediocre. Simple enough. My theory is that Ubisoft put so much effort pleasing the crybabies that didn't like the rpg Assassin's Creed that they forgot they need to make a good game for the people that just want to play a banger that they are going to remember for the rest of their life. I understand this wasn't the big project ubi was preparing. I think Codename red is that. This game is like an anniversary gift to the old schools but it just ain't a good game. They tried so hard to copy the old games and that you can see from the game itself. Kind of Disappointed to be honest. Ubisoft please . Continue making good games. Because you are. Stop trying to do things to please the nostalgia meat riders. I honestly don't like what I am about to say but I don't recommend you to play this.;Not Informed;5 November 2023;5 out of 8 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Fantastic Assassin's Creed game;I have played all of the main Assasin's Creed games many times and I LOVE this game!!! I found the story to be quite interesting and the world and atmosphere alone are worth playing this game for! The focus on stealth is exactly what I like about this franchise and the tools make for a very interesting and fair stealth experience which (yes I know) really makes you feel like an assassin. They also made combat more interesting but also more difficult which encourages you to use stealth even more. Basim and his different robes look great and the blackbox missions, fantastic music, the many hiding spots and the more parkour-friendly open world make for a combination of the best features in the franchise.I finished this game in about 26 hours and I'm not at all bored by it. In fact I kind of want to replay it again right now, unlike Vallhalla which I didn't like nearly as much as Mirage. It is really impressive how they made this game feel really different from Valhalla despite using the same engine, UI and similar gameplay systems. How they made it feel good again is a mystery to me but I love it.I would highly recommend swapping (on xbox) RT (right trigger) with LS (left stick). This makes the game feel so much better as you have more control over whether you are sprinting or not and it feels like the good part about the older games. it makes you feel heavy. The tool wheel is perfectly usable on the left stick but you could also switch that around if you prefer something else.In Mirage you'll be eavesdropping and tailing targets in some missions as well which I personally loved about the older games. The assassin fantasy takes center stage and even the larger story about the isu stuff, which I never really cared about until Valhalla kinda, is also really interesting to me here.The voice acting and camera movement during dialogue and its animations could really use an overhaul though. Social stealth and blending options are here and they're great, but a lot more could be done with them. The parkour and combat also still suffer from the crappy animations from the previous few games but you can't really fault the game for this too much.To me this game is much more than just a "trip down memory lane" which I'm a little bit sick of hearing by now. I think this is a very competent game which deserves its place in the series. Hopefully this wasn't the last game with this level of quality Assassin's Ceed-ness because this confirmed to me why I love these games.;9/10;18 October 2023;10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Really Good, but Not Classic;Assassin's Creed Mirage was a giant leap in the right direction after 3 massive open world RPGs. It took elements of those games and elements of the classic games before Assassin's Creed Origins. Assassin's Creed Mirage was about 20 hours long vs the 60 hours for Assassin's Creed Odyssey and 85 hours on Assassin's Valhalla, both of which were argued to be too long. The story was fairly average until the end when it got way better. The intro felt slightly rushed and the combat don't feel like a classic Assassin's Creed game not an RPG Assassin's Creed game plus the addition of the new teleportation mechanic. Fortunately, stealth is back and it is perfect. The developers really nailed that. So all in all, Assassin's Creed Mirage is a good game and worth your time, just understand this is not a classic Assassin's Creed game.;8/10;1 November 2023;5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Other than that the stealth is incredible the world building is amazing and other than the fact that it's short the story was good. But overall I enjoyed this game and i think any fan should try give it a try.;9/10;21 February 2024;2 out of 5 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;A partial return to the better days of Assassin's Creed;Assassin's Creed was one of my favorite franchises. When the first game was coming out, I was extremely excited about this new ip coming from one of my favorite developers. Mixing the genres of stealth and action with new social stealth mechanics.But what truly made Assassin's Creed standout was the characters, the stories. I will always remember the emotion I felt during the end of Assassin's Creed Revelations or the memorable music like Ezios theme song. It's iconic. Ubisoft truly had made a generational hit. All these years later, the Assassin's Creed franchise has been reduced to nothing. Gone are the great well written characters, gone are the great emotional impacting stories, gone is the memorable music. What do we have in its place? Soulless, cheap, cashgrab titles that focus more on wasting your time rather than providing a meaningful experience.Now what of Assassin's Creed Mirage. Is it truly the return to form that Ubisoft promised? Well, to that question, I answer as a whole no, but in small partial ways, I say yes.So what does Assassin's Creed Mirage get right. Well, the atmosphere, Ubisoft truly did a wonderful job at bringing us back to the better days of this franchise as far as the world is concerned. The look is there, the feeling is there, and the games character animations are actually surprising well done, with almost no glitches or issues.Probably the best part of this recent addition to the franchise is the costume design. The outfits you can wear are beautiful, personally myself. I was rocking Altairs' original assassin's outfit no one can beat the og! As for you, Ezio fans, don't worry. Ubisoft has you covered. You can unlock his outfit, too.Having Altairs outfit was a tremendous plus for me because not only did it look fantastic in the games world, but it literally helped me role-play like I was back in the golden days of this franchise Believing myself to be Altair once more was such an amazing feeling. Then I had even more fun when the edition of the game I had came with a Prince of Persia costume pack. So I then also role-played like I was playing a new Prince of Persia title. I miss that franchise, too. But even with all this fun, I was able to have it doesn't hide the fact that this game is just so painfully average.The voice acting is boring, the characters are boring, the writing is boring, the story is ok, but I barely cared for it. However it did I must confess to having an interesting twist ending. But I can tell you right now it wasn't the story that got me through the 17-hour experience of this game.The world is well for lack of a better word dead. The npcs in this game are not reactive towards your actions. Obviously, they react to your killing, but what I mean is they lack any reaction to seeing a man cloaked in white climbing walls and jumping off roof tops. They don't say anything like past npcs did in the original Assassin's Creed titles. It's not a big deal, but it added to the grounded feeling those past games had.The side objectives are ok and can sometimes lead to interesting things, but like recent Assassin's Creed entries, they're just busy work intended to merely expand the games time. While the rewards from said objectives are useful, I just didn't care enough to do them so much.Disappointingly, the stealth mechanics in this game I found to be extremely choppy and half baked. Getting caught in instances and scenarios that left me thinking, "wtf, how is that possible?" I eventually gave up on stealth and said screw it, I'll just kill everyone." But the combat system is no better. The best I can say for it is that it's slightly better than the combat in Odyssey or Valhalla, though I barely touched Valhalla because a couple of hours into that game I could tell it was another Odyssey except with Vikings, and I absolutely detested Odyssey. I forced myself to complete that atrocity!The parkour mechanics also felt choppy. I found myself on multiple occasions to be fighting the playable character in going in one direction, but the animation forced him in another. But to be fair, these issues have plagued the franchise since the start. So I can't really deduct points on that. Though you'd think all these years later, Ubisoft would have it fixed by now.The nicest thing I can say about Mirage is that at least I didn't have to force myself to get through it, but after 11 hours, I was eager to be done. However the biggest problem with Mirage is that it requires a lot of "let's pretend" like let's pretend I'm back in the golden days of Assassin's Creed, let's pretend these characters are interesting, let's pretend I'm actually caring about anything in this game. If you are a fan like me and loved the original Assassin's Creed games as I did, then you will understand that this is not the return to form that was promised.Now Assassin's Creed Mirage isn't the worst game in the franchise I can happily say, but it doesn't live up to the legacy of the original games that Ubisoft promised this title would go back to. Respectfully, I can say that Ubisoft did abandon the big open world, the boring rpg mechanics, and return to the days that we played in more of a sandbox with multiple avenues of completing mission objectives. But there's nothing exciting in these mission objectives. Literally, one mission objective was to get some flowers for an npc. How exciting! And I'm sorry, but I can't take anything seriously when the characters in the game themselves just don't seem to care. Literally felt like the voice actors phoned it in. But I will give Ubisoft credit in saying it seemed they did cast what looked like an entire Middle Eastern cast, so I can appreciate that.Lastly, I will say that as a positive, this title is not a full priced game, $49.99 for the base game, then $59.99 for the deluxe edition. So, I am genuinely surprised by that price point. But considering this title is no where near as big or as long as recent Assassin's Creed entries I understand why but even then I'd rather play this smaller more compact game that the inflated nothingness that Valhalla and Odyssey were.Overall, Assassin's Creed Mirage is a mild disappointment. It has some things that, as a fan of the original titles I can enjoy, but it relies heavily on your ability to ignore all the bad. This is why my final score is a bit difficult because I want to be generous, but at the same time all the games faults are blatant, yet I did have fun in the role-playing capacity that I had with Altairs outfit, still though I shouldn't have to play make believe to feel like I'm playing Assassin's Creed in an Assassin's Creed game.So I will choose generosity and give Assassin's Creed Mirage a five out of ten. For merely being the most playable Assassin's Creed since Origins. But I will put Ubisoft on notice here by saying you have a chance for the next time you do a title like this to truly go back to the golden days of Assassin's Creed. Please go back to the roots that made this franchise great, I want to believe in you, Ubisoft. Make Assassin's Creed great again.Final score: 5/10 3/5Played on Xbox Series X and Ubisoft Connect on PC.;5/10;9 October 2023;25 out of 39 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Short with nothing new.;I had high hopes for this game, following Odyssey and Val Halla, but was very disappointed. I honestly wish that I'd not wasted my money.The storyline was very short, with nothing in terms of character development or adventure.Once again we were uncovering a hidden/ancient group of cultists, just like the in Odyssey, but outside of that was nothing.If you're looking to buy this game, I'd say don't waste your time. I wonder if this game was just a short term money maker, while they develop the next real adventure?Very disloyal to the lifelong players of Assassin's Creed, by teasing with vague elements of the original games.;3/10;16 November 2023;8 out of 11 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Two Steps Back;Every step forward this series has made with the last two releases seems to come with two steps back. Mirage is no different. From overly difficult, clunky combat, to a lackluster story, to twenty minute puzzles that end up only rewarding you with "gear schematics" for gear you don't even use. Every system seems to have taken a backslide into the realm of irritating and inconsistent. The whole game feels rushed and poorly thought out. Half of the skill on the skill trees are unimaginative and only questionably useful. Compared to Odyssey, which I personally consider the best entry into the series, this game feels like we're back at Brotherhood - not a terrible game in its own right, but a far cry from the masterpiece that was Odyssey. I know they were trying to make homages to the original games, but they picked all the wrong places to make them. The clunkiness, the bugs, the tepid story telling - these are not the things people remember fondly about the old games, but that's what we got with Mirage.;4/10;13 October 2023;15 out of 28 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Heading in the wrong direction.;I started playing the Assassin's games when Origins was released and I've sunk hundreds of hours into the ARPG games, (Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla), since then and loved every minute. I also tried the older games in the series as, according to Assassin's fanboys, the earlier games are the GOAT, but they just aren't. They're clunky, slow paced and the game mechanics are awful, just like they are in Mirage. Which isn't surprising, as this was touted as a return to the roots of the franchise in a pathetic attempt to appease a loud minority who hated the direction the new games took. So, now we have a mediocre game with terrible combat, QuickTime events, skill trees with only a few perks, a short completion time and a tiny map. The only saving grace is that Ubisoft didn't charge a lot for it.I hope that Shadows is a return to the ARPG style of Origins et al, and that Ubisoft disregard the keening of the minority who are stuck in the past and, when faced with a fantastic game with a large map full of side quests and filler content markers, are unable to realise that they dont have to interact with everything: that they're free to concentrate on the main story and complete the game in 20 or 30 hours instead of whining about the extra content on the Internet, or that they're free to just not buy the newer games in the first place if they don't like the gameplay.The world has moved on, things change, listening to dewy eyed fanboys in rose tinted glasses barking about the good old days only results in games like Starfield and Mirage two of my worst purchases in recent times.;3/10;22 May 2024;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Trash;I simply struggled for 3 months to convince myself that it's worth playing and I can't play, I gave my money for nothing, the same repeated missions over and over and over again, useless and annoying missions, I'll never buy another assassin creed. The game is very weak, the stories and the gameplay and the missions are repeated endlessly and you end up hating the game..gamers wants easily accessible gameplay without nerves and to change the missions for the hell of it, because I'm damn tired of looking for cards and dummies in the map. When you assassinate someone,wow what a tricky mission was this, this assassin creed rubbish should cost you 20 pounds maximum not what they ask me for them.;1/10;2 January 2024;8 out of 14 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Graphical Equivalent of Gollum;I don't know why, but Ubisoft haven't evolved on the graphics on the Assassin's Creed series since Origins.It's as dull as a ps4 game released 10 years ago. Shameful really. Apart from that, the story is almost twilight level bad and predictable with mediocre to laughable voice acting.The bad out of the way, the assassin approach in this game in direct contrast to the past 3 RPG titles, is a welcome change. It brings a sort of mix of the rpg and the old AC vibes. It feels rewarding to be stealthy. The upgrades and tools also make for a good change of approach on your missions and it's fun for a good handful of hours, if you can refrain from cringing over the voice acting and bad facial expressions.6/10.;5/10;11 October 2023;11 out of 21 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Weirdly broken game;Downloaded the game they're offering - like 90 minutes to play the game before you have to decide weather to buy.I was done less than 30 minutes in.First issue was he wouldn't run up one of those triangular wooden things leaning against a wall.Literally WOULD NOT RUN UP IT. Ran around it, but if I tried to make him run up to thing he'd vear off. After wasting 45 seconds trying to get him to do this simple task, I gave up. But I realized this showed a lack of quality control in the development of the game.Then, a few minutes later I was trying to steal whatever the Templars had in that box AND HE WOULDN'T KNEEL ANYMORE. Tried hitting the button over and over.NOTHING.I need him to sneak.He won't sneak.Done.I get it that quality control is lacking these days.But this game has been out for months now. And you'd think they'd want folks to have a nice experience while this shoehorned "secret" story unspools for 90 minutes.But no.Will literally never buy anything else in this universe.And this from someone who's put well over 400 hours into Assassin's Creed Odyssey.;2/10;19 April 2024;2 out of 3 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Mirage;Total and utter garbage;The developers lied this is no step in the right direction of what assassins creed fans actually want we want the games to go back to how assassins creed 2 was the graphics were way friggin better this has still got stupid RPG stuff in it which we never even asked for even when origins came along and odyssey and Valhalla seriously who in their right mind asked for a stupid RPG genre for assassins creed it doesn't go with the parkour or stealth or assassination's seriously Ubisoft do you even know how to make your own franchise anymore a franchise you've been making since 2007 you're telling me you've somehow forgotten how to make your games funny stuff.;1/10;17 October 2023;11 out of 34 found this helpful.
