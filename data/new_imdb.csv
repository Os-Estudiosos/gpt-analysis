0;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;A Cup of Tea that has Turned into a Mug;"I remember when I first saw this game on TV when the Xbox One was first revealed. When this game flashed on screen during an ID@Xbox show reel, I became interested in an instant. That was back in 2013, and skip forward a few years later, I have yet to buy an Xbox One or any of the ""exclusives,"" even when most of them are on PC. That changed when this game FINALLY released, and the best part is, the wait is worth it.Now, before I get too deep into the gameplay, I have to say that unlike most journalists in the field these days, I'm not gonna do the idiotic ""#Cup Souls"" thing or even compare this game to Dark Souls in the slightest. While Dark Souls can be challenging, a more accurate comparison is most likely an NES game, which can actually be more difficult. Just like a NES game, more precisely Contra, it's an easy-to-play Run-N-Gun game, thanks to the simple tutorial that only a certain game journalist would find hard, that becomes hard thanks to ever spawning enemies and projectiles everywhere. Luckily, the game is still fair, and it even feels rewarding beating the bosses in the game, which is mostly what the game is. The controls are tight and responsive, though I have changed the dash to the Right Trigger for better access, and never have I felt like they were fighting against me. Back to the bosses, though, they will give you a beat down. We're talking about bosses that will fill the screen with projectiles and enemies, and they will require your whole attention span and quick thumbs to beat them. This game is a great time, solo or co-op, but if you're not a fan of hard games, it won't be for you.Now, for the one thing it quickly got attention for, the graphics. Seriously, we can gush over a game for having the most ""ULTRA-REALISTIC"" graphics, but I find this game to have the most impressive graphics I've ever seen. This game sets out to emulate the look of the 1930s cartoons, and it emulates it to a T. The game sprites run at 24 fps, just like the cartoons of old, but still provides a rock solid 60 fps during gameplay, except for some very rare frame dips. The music and sound also adds to the graphics as well with the soundtracks mix of jazz and ragtime (if you don't believe me, just look up ""Dice King theme"" on YouTube), and you can even hear crackling sounds during the quiet times.Overall, this a hard, yet awesome game that emulates the aesthetic perfectly. If you have an Xbox One, this game is a must-have, and even if you're getting the game on PC, which you have a choice of getting it from Steam, GOG, or Microsoft Store if you want the ""Play Anywhere"" version, this game can pretty much run on a toaster.";10/10;8 October 2017;16 out of 18 found this helpful.
1;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;You could say this game is my cup of tea.;Cuphead is brilliant, it is the pinnacle of indie gaming. Different aspects make this a master piece. Recently with indie games there have been a fair share of absolutely shocking and poor games. I feel like recently trying to find a good cheap indie game is like searching for a diamond ring in a metric tonne of pig crap. Cuphead is this ring and I'm wearing it proudly.The first aspect that makes this brilliant is the visuals. The old Disney inspired visuals get me excited. They have that nice old Disney feel and definitely are made by the attention to detail (Cupheads little gloves are adorable). The map you walk around to get to each level is very nice, it may be a little simple to begin with but as you progressive, boy does it look good.The second aspect I love about it is the sound track, can't really describe it, go listen to it yourself on YouTube. It has a nice classic sounds to it. I wouldn't listen to it on my bus journey but it does add to the atmosphere of the gameWorth a buy, do it immediately, wont regret it!Joe Beaumont;10/10;16 October 2017;12 out of 14 found this helpful.
2;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;'A Great Slam and Then Some!';Cuphead is a slice of video game heaven and surprisingly appealing piece of animation gold. Having been in development for the better part of a decade, Cuphead burst onto the video game market just in 2017, and it's resulted in a resurgence in the internet's love for 'The Golden Age of Animation' and the works of the great Max Fleischer. Does the game emulate those cartoons of a bygone era pre-dating World War Two? Yes. It absolutely does just that and then some! Yes the game's frustrating for newcomers to the run and gun genre but the sense of gratification and accomplishment you get from beating any one of the bosses in-game is incredible.This game takes pages from gaming classics like MegaMan, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario World and even Contra. it even pays homage to 'toon classics like Popeye, Betty Boop, Disney shorts from the 20s and 30s, has nods to the Looney Tunes shorts, and even Tom & Jerry. Cuphead is a masterclass in 'cultural remixing', fusing video games and animation into the perfect combo package. What is there not to like about something that has THIS many callbacks while being its own thing as well?Cuphead is a game for the ages and will introduce newcomers to the run-and-gun genre, as well as persuade some people to play MegaMan sometime in the future.;10/10;29 January 2018;8 out of 10 found this helpful.
3;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;One of the best Arcade titles of the 8th Generation 9/10;"Cuphead has been a massive long time coming But, finally arrived for XBox One and The PC I'm not going to over sell this game to anyone It is absolutely a amazing accomplishment in where gaming has gone since the days of the seedy arcades and Atari 2600 But, It does have a elephant size negative against itGraphics Flawless there is nothing and i mean nothing like this that's been out there (Besides the handful of Laserdisc arcade title from the 80's) More games need to be like this it's pure Art in motion The animation is a sight to see Audio: much like the art style is frozen in the 1930's this too is a sight to hear The art style and audio presentation make this game feel old but, at the same time it's also refreshing and new The Story is better then i would've ever guessed Not even going to spoil it while it's nothing life changing it's very slick and works for this time period it's set in The only real negative (The difficulty is over the top brutal) If you have young kids save your money buy Raymen, Yooka-Laylee, or even Ori and The Blind Forest This game will make any kid cry...... or break a expensive controller The game is too ""hard"" I'm not sure why the developers didn't even add a difficulty option I've played some brutal games growing up but, this is on a whole new level of being hard for the sake of being hard This is going to turn a lot of gamers off and if you plan on going all in (pick up a glass make a swear jar) you'll going to need the money in the jar after you break your controller from anger or just the massive abuse the controller takes) No matter what if and when you finish the game you're controller will be bruised and beaten much like youIf you want a relentless challenge you'll dig this game If you are unsure try and play the demo to get a feel for what's in store for you If the game wasn't so stacked against the player I'd give the game a 10/10 But, it's to hard as a kid i loved Ghost and Goblins and Ghouls and Ghosts (Beat both games) this is harder then Ghost and Goblins in my opinion so it gets a 9/10";9/10;9 October 2017;4 out of 6 found this helpful.
4;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;Very Fun Game;Cuphead mixes the classic feel of the 30's with platforming brilliantly.;10/10;17 June 2019;4 out of 6 found this helpful.
5;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;Buy it.;"On September 29, 2017, a small, indie game developing company Studio MDHR released ""Cuphead"", a widely loved shmup/platformer that was not only a love letter to fans of classic early cartoons of the 1930's, but also a throwback to the insanely difficult side-scrolling games of the '80s and '90s, such as ""Contra"" and ""Astyanax"".I love ""Cuphead"", absolutely love it - it's not just my favorite video game of this decade this far, but one of my favorite all-time video games, period. I bought it for Easter this year on the Nintendo Switch and I've played it to death ever since. I'm absolutely in love with it.The game is undoubtedly a masterpiece of not just video gaming, but also animation - it is an absolute delight, from its stunning hand-drawn visuals and beautiful watercolor backgrounds that feel right out of an early Disney animation, to its catchy and upbeat jazz scores that accompany the levels that become more intense as the levels themselves get increasingly difficult, to its difficulty that encourages you to continue and try harder rather than just give up.If you like classic side-scrolling platformer/fighting games, buy this game. You won't be disappointed.";10/10;9 July 2019;4 out of 6 found this helpful.
6;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;When nostalgy and gaming experience collides;"This game is an awesome retro-adventure, in a very exciting way. Game is 100% ""focus on details"" high-quality, a true journey to the 30's, The music the animations and the effects will influence your mood in a good way.It would require above-average skills with similar video-games, most likely a few levels would be a little headache for even an experienced gamer , however some people would like to tag this production as a ""rage-game"", at some level it appears to be true.You will need all of your skills to beat the bosses that's for sure.";Not Informed;7 November 2017;4 out of 7 found this helpful.
7;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;A Cupful of Fun;"I'm a fan of the run and gun subgenere and a fan of animation, like any good brew mixed it makes a nice cup of tea. This is the kind of game I honestly never thought would happen in a million years and I'm glad someone finally had the guts to make something like this.There nothing to say to much in plot which by it's nature is really a clothesline for the action which is common for every run in gun game, nor anything to say in it's format which isn't anything I haven't seen already in the run and gun subgenere. but what makes this game stick out is in both visual presentation and execution in action.The visual animation in this game is just fantastic, it really looks like a lost cartoon from a bygone era. Obviously inspired by the animation shorts from Max Fletcher, Popeye, Disney, and many more. each of the scenes from the game down to the character animation could even go into a art galary. However the visuals truly exceed in created a weard and wacky cartoon world, it a world that just a visual buffet, the word normal doesn't exist. So much happens and so many things you just discover that would make you think ""What the Frak?"" but at the same time be amazed that you just want to see more. Music in the game is also really good, it really fits the nature of this game as this kind of music was in the old cartoon shorts. most of the music is composed of old orchastratic and piano tunes and old jazz.But it's of course the gameplay that to me really is the best thing about the game. You do have the typical run and gun aspect however what makes this unique is the fact that most of this game consists highly of boss battles divided into three or four stages. I really love this, it's sort of a mix of both the run and gun and fighting game genere which is something I don't see often except in the game ""Contra: Shattered Soilder"". Just like in the fighting games you always trying to beat your current opponent, just to get to the next one to deliver a beat down.It's kinda the same principle here but with the run and gun principles mixed in. Like in the fighting games you can't expect to beat your opponent completely. also like in the run and gun's you can't expect to get it right the first time, which is why like in both those games your going to see yourself die again and again. However don't fret about it, where there is a will there is a way and that way is preserverence. When you keep at it, you actually do get better and even discover the opponents aren't really that hard at all it just seems that way at first, but once you figure it all out then you can blow them away easy (well kinda). I really like the bosses and the boss fights. Each of the bosses are memorable it is just a colorful guest list. from a pirate that looks like Bluto from ""Popeye"", a giant Queen Bee that can perform magic and turn into a plane, a set of alcoholic drinks, a medusa mermaid etc. The boss fights are great because each of them are always something different mainly in format which consists of platform hoping, moving platform, contained area, shump segments, etc. This keeps the boss fights always fresh as each fight is always something different and unexpected, which causes you to make quick adjustments and utilize fresh tactics to winning. Two of my favorate boss fights are one in the theater against a crazed actress which I thought was cool since I'm an actor and theater is part of my speciality. though ironically fits the nature of the game since running plays always consist of change in scenes and acts. The other is a dial game where you parry the die and the dial moves you to a space that contains a boss, much like that board game level in the game ""Gunstar Heroes"".What also gives the game appeal is it's throwback factor for both animation and gaming. Just looking at the visuals it really threw me back to a time when I was a kid watching the cartoon shorts and having the time of my life. Same with gaming when I played with my NES or went to the arcade which consisted of a lot of hard games. I'm now an adult and playing this game just put me in touch with that inner child of mine and made me smile.Though this game might not be everyone's cup of tea, this game is more for vetern fans of run and gun games whom all know the risks coming to the teritory. If your a fan of run and gun and hard games and are looking for a chalange, this game is for you. if not then this game may not be your cup of tea.Cuphead is a cup filled with fun.Rating: 4 stars";10/10;20 December 2017;3 out of 5 found this helpful.
8;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;Never knew such a masterpiece could exist;This game literally has everything going for it. The 1930s art style is awesomely done in this game and the way the characters move remind me of those old Mickey Mouse cartoons that my parents would show me when I was little. The bosses in this game are wacky and cool looking, plus they are pretty challenging. Then we have that beautiful soundtrack that just fits this game so perfectly. There are also cool run and gun levels, awesome weapons and charms, and also pretty cool looking isles. This game is a masterpice, but just be warned that this game is no walk in a 1930s park.;10/10;3 May 2020;3 out of 5 found this helpful.
9;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;Somehow nostalgic;Though controller breaking frustrating, still charming with fun colorful visuals and catchy tunes. I was born in 2004, and yet this 1940's too somehow feels nostalgic. Favorite boss is the mermaid, and my favorite character was Werner Werman.;8/10;15 July 2019;3 out of 7 found this helpful.
10;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;Full of Nostalgia and Beauty, Cuphead is a Unique Title That's EVEN MORE DIFFICULT Than You've Heard;"Seeing the first trailer for Cuphead, I immediately swooned. The marriage between that animation and a videogame was something that seemed impossible. It was a big moment of ""how did no one think of this before?"" With it being an Xbox release and not having the confidence to try and play this on PC, it seemed like I wouldn't get the chance to ever give Cuphead a shot. The PS4 edition was a big surprise and despite the warnings, I picked it up and battled my way through. Was it worth the wait? I think it depends on the type of gamer you are. I'll be covering the pros and cons below.Visually and acoustically, Cuphead absolutely lives up to hype. This game is so unlike any other big release on the market. Not only is it unique but its got all the polish and there's little out of place. The animation is exciting and well designed throughout. Cuphead feels authentic to the cartoons of yesteryear its paying tribute to and if I hadn't watched so much material on it ahead of time, this game would have floored me. I also really enjoyed the music and all of the work with the sound. The score is very orchestral but there's jazz influence and each fight brings some new catchy beat that's going to have your toes tapping while you're screaming at your TV or computer monitor. I also want to credit the gameplay (I'm going to talk about the difficulty later) for also having a different flavour. The game is mostly boss fights with a few platforming levels sprinkled in and I think there was a considerable effort into making each one memorable. Is every level equally stunning or fun? Absolutely not but I remember each fight and something that made that one different.Part of the aura surrounding Cuphead is the reports of how difficult it is. Go on the internet, there are many videos of let's play gamers screaming, crying and yelling. I thought it couldn't be that bad.... Could it? I was full of hubris to think I could do better. This game is RIDICULOUSLY HARD, I spent hours trying to beat each boss. Not just 20-30 minutes, 2-3 HOURS at a time for the more difficult ones. There is so little margin for error and no breaks when playing Cuphead. Reviewers reassured gamers that the feeling when beating a boss made up for all the anguish, it wasn't that way for me. I became so desensitized to failing that after I beat one, I sighed and moved on to the next. Kahl's Robot took 3 different sessions just for me to beat it and the Run & Gun levels weren't any easier. The difficulty isn't fun and it goes beyond any normal expectations for a ""difficult"" experience. Between the time invested, the frustration, the repetition and the anguish, I was miserable most of the time I was playing this game.This is one of my shorter reviews and that's reflective of the kind of experience I had with this game. Was there plenty of stuff I loved? Definitely, it's an ambitious product with style to burn that both critics and more tolerant gamers have showered with adoration. But I didn't truly enjoy any moment playing this game past the opening credits/prologue. I respect this game and its creators. they should be praised. But I will never play this game again, its too difficult to recommend and it wasn't worth the time I invested in it to beat it. I'm not trying to whine or go on about my experience, if you look at the stats, they reaffirm my take. On average 10 PERCENT of people who played this game actually finished it. That statistic tells the story of how TRULY accessible this game is and if you loved this game when you finished it, I tip my hat to you. I've rated it based upon both the pros and cons and arrived in the middle. Don't be like me and just assume you're just going to fly through this game. Buy it if you're interested in a REAL CHALLENGE, if you're more of a casual gamer, watch a let's play and have a few laughs instead.";7/10;13 November 2020;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
11;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;Favorite game of all time;Cuphead has both spectacular graphics and amazing music. The gameplay of all the different and unique bosses are extremely entertaining. Beating one feels like climbing a mountain. Highly recommend trying to find all the secrets of the world especially the 4th barber shop singer. Even if you don't normally like games of this genre I still would recommend you try it.;Not Informed;24 June 2019;3 out of 5 found this helpful.
12;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;Eh;This game is good. The only thing I am not a fan of is how hard some of the bosses are. Everything else is great. The art style, most of the bosses, and the storyline.;9/10;31 May 2020;1 out of 5 found this helpful.
13;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;The Most Hardest Video Game;I'm not gonna lie, this is probably the most challenging, the most hardest, the most difficult game I have played. But you know what, it was actually all worth the entirety of it. Cuphead is a magnificent game that takes the challenging gaming to a whole new level. It has given an excellent tribute with an engaging story that develops Cuphead's journey and top notch graphics that's faithful to the classic cartoons. But in order to make this into a cartoon game, make the gameplay intense, exciting and difficult to give time for the players that would unexpected what would happen on each level and on each bosses. If you are a fan of cartoons and even of video games, or if you want to try a challenging game, I absolutely recommend this game. As much strategy we would use to beat this game, the more of how excellent it will get. Not only would I consider my favorite hard game, but also one of the best indie games I've played. The past decade has been big for indie games, and this is no exception.;10/10;30 July 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
14;Unity Technologies;Cuphead;There's only one thing that brings Cuphead down;After the success of Arcanum, it's starting to show that series based on games can be good, and this is no exception. Cuphead, apart from a few minor things, does everything right. The animation is absolutely superb. Hats off to you. The music is also great, and the intro is especially good. The main duo Cuphead and Mugman are absolutely iconic and their characters are, in my opinion, really great for an animated film. The plot with the devil is also a luxury. It all works so wonderfully and actually the only thing that spoils it for me is the filler episodes. I mean the episodes that don't move the main plot anywhere and are just such a bonus. Granted there were only a few of them and they're mainly around fifteen minutes long so you get them right away and they weren't downright bad either, but they were still more of a nuisance than a benefit in my eyes. I can understand the writers' intention to make the series a bit longer, since each episode is already short and there are only 12 of them. It's a shame though, because it brings the series down unnecessarily. Otherwise, I have nothing to complain about and for me this is a great series that I liked right after the first episode and it became my favourite as far as game adaptations go. I like cartoons in general, so no wonder. For me, a great series that I recommend to fans of the game, but also fans of animated series in general.;8/10;19 February 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With this game being my first video game review, I think it deserves the honor. The hand-drawn animation style is truly the selling point of this game to me, but the difficulty to each level and amount of raging there is to this game is probably not healthy, but oh so rewarding. The last isle you have to defeat (including the casino) was probably some of the hardest 2D animated video game levels I've ever played.

20;Unity Technologies;Hearthstone;Imbalanced game with no care for user experience;"This game was fun and interactive when it came out, however, expansions totally killed its magic. Developers decided to add imbalanced cards and use them to force players into playing expansion-specific deck archetypes. Any element of fun just got lost. The game is no more decided by skillful play and careful consideration of opponents deck, but merely by draw luck, as cards and their specific combinations are so strong that one card drawn card can basically kill an opponent on its own. The game of course not only doesn't offer any counter-action for the most powerful cards, but the developers even went out of their way to ban them (the cards which had the potential to counter some of the most powerful cards) from the game.It doesn't pay off to create a unique deck and surprise opponents with non-standard cards, because the difference in cards' power-level dictates what cards can you play to be successful.In other words: I really enjoyed the game up to the expansion Journey to Un'Goro, but afterward, it became an unfocused mess. In my opinion, it's not worth getting into at this point.""Battlegrounds"" is a fun mode, but super luck dependent and the Arena suffers from the same issues as competitive: snowball effect can kill you without having a chance to react.Update: problems of luck and hyper-powerful cards are increasing every expansion. Your skill and experience don't matter in the slightest. Encountering 12/12 on the third turn against the druid, losing to single cards, opponents generating basically an infinite amount of cards from thin air, and insanely powerful cards which cost 0 mana (meaning there is no limit how many of them you can play during your turn) absolutely soured my experience with Hearthstone. Trash. Not worth the time investment.";Not Informed;14 November 2021;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

GREAT go for it!Do you not have time for that and just want to get through the story? GREAT no problem, both will serve good competition.While extremely hard in areas which can be either good or bad depending on the player there are items so easy to miss that you might not have a chance to get them without outside help.Even though the title and story overwrites the majority of later Crash titles it does it in a celebratory manner instead of erasing it from existence.Long story short, the game is fun, unique, beautiful and hard!;9/10;29 October 2021;3 out of 5 found this helpful.

They managed to keeo the core of Crash Bandicoot, yet added som touches and abilites to make it really fun and modern.The levels are well designed with great music and cool features with a lot of different obstacles and hazards.I think anyone who played the games since the 90s is going to find this game very entertaining, and the platforming allows new players to have fun with Crash straight away.For anyone who is on the journey to platinum trophy, like me, we are up for the biggest challenge yet. Good luck! (We're gonna need it);10/10;10 October 2020;7 out of 14 found this helpful.
30;Unity Technologies;Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time;One heckuva time!;This game is a blast start to finish, so many levels to play, things to collect and bosses to master!

31;Unity Technologies;Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time;Was having a lot of fun...until;So some of you might remember how much I loved the N. Sane Trilogy, even though I'd never played a Crash game in my life before that point. And so I was looking forward to this game, and really, really enjoyed it...for a while.See, while the game is really well animated, has a lot of great level design, and Cortex is still a great laugh, there is a roughly equal amount of level design that really made me angry, I didn't find most of the humour all that funny, especially not when compared to the N. Sane Trilogy, and by god...the completion requirements.And before anyone gets snotty about me thinking that it's necessary to 100% the game when it technically isn't, well you're completely correct. However, the game taken at its normal pace and only playing it through to the end without collecting everything will only take you around four to five hours, but the ludicrous amount of stuff needed to 100% the game, unlike the original trilogy, is just thoroughly not worth it.Over 400 gems, including hidden ones, flashback tapes that can be serious pains to finish, and all in some of the hardest levels ever made in the entire series up until now, and when you add all that up, what it results in is the fact that unlike the N. Sane Trilogy, I would only ever recommend playing this through to finish it, not complete it.If you do that, it's just as fun, if not more so than the N. Sane Trilogy, but through all the repetition if you're aiming to complete it, the humour that occasionally falls flat, and the frustration overtaking the fun far too often, I can't say I'm anywhere near as likely to return to this one as I am the N. Sane Trilogy any time soon.Oh well, it was fun for a few hours...;6/10;9 December 2020;8 out of 12 found this helpful.

33;Unity Technologies;Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time;For fans... a little idealized;"At one point ActiBliz seems to have got tired of simply collecting money from CoD and decided to squeeze the nostalgia a bit, so, after years of absence, aborted projects (two TV series) and failed experiments (Mutants), here it finally comes a new game about the silly but charismatic peramelidae that raised the 80s/90s generation and that had become the ""Mario"" of the Playstation. To take charge of it was ""Toys for Bob"", which had previously tried to badly include the two mascots Spyro and Crash in the infernal circle of games with scannable figurines, then ending up making them simply two more monsters among the many available. However, T.f.B undoubtedly remained the team with the most experience with this IP and also with a good propensity for cartoonish style, together with ""Vicarious Vision"" who previously dealt with porting their games for less performing consoles. Paradoxically, T.f.B had to do the remaster of the Spyro trilogy, which perhaps needed more skill given its more exploratory nature, while Vicarious had the remaster of the Bandicoot trilogy. The results were objectively good in both cases, the iconography was recovered and transposed adequately and even if the wrinkles of time on the playful side were visible, they proved to be still enjoyable games. It is also true, however, that rejuvenating games is not the same as creating them, and in hindsight, if only one sequel had to be made between the two sagas, it would have been better to give T.f.B the Crash trilogy, both to maintain greater stylistic coherence and to assimilate more the essence of that ip.Crash 4 is a successful project, but not perfect in my opinion. The doubt that came to me is which group of players wants to like it. I believe that T.f.B has misunderstood his audience. Historical fans no longer have the reflexes and the free time of the past and with the new ones the platform genre, traditionally cartoon and colorful, is no longer popular, so it is difficult to create a new passionate generation, even more if you rediscover a dated vertical structure, which suffers as originally from an imprecise perception of depth. Not that you have to do everything open-world, on the contrary, but neither should we avoid taking steps forward.Crash games have always been a bit challenging, but T.f.B wanted to increase the load on the player's shoulders. You can't wear the guise of a video game for enthusiasts, if you are then forced to recommend the mode with infinite lives and more numerous checkpoints, it means admitting that something in the balance has gone wrong. Furthermore, the checkpoints are not always put at their best and sometimes the additional ones appear instead in the ideal points or in useless points, such as the Bonus platforms which act as checkpoints in turn. Difficulty makes but it can also kill the fun and sorry to say, there's too much severe trial-and-error. Half a dozen times, without a couple of extra tiki masks I don't know if I would have been able to continue the game.Interesting was the inclusion of three additional characters to diversify the gameplay. In general it is risky, but fortunately they tried to keep the jumps as a fundamental mechanic. However, the characters introduced are not perfect. Dingodile is a Tank-type, based on the directional vacuum cleaner. It's fun to use with boxes, but rather clunky, although you get used to it over time. Tawva was probably the most controversial, given the typical tough-girl liberal-chich twist. With the excuse of the universes, she does not respect and consequently does not noble the original character, however it must be recognized that in the movements, although essentially only a more physical reinterpretation of Crash, she is the funniest of the three. However, the grappling hook should be improved, because to reach the boxes sometimes you have to position yourself millimeterly and the hook does not seem flawless even in large jumps. Finally, we have the historical nemesis of the peramelidae, Dr. Cortex who with his transforming pistol is probably the worst of all. He's not as slow as Dingodale, but he's stiffer and more inaccurate at hitting enemies, and his short dash suspension can be problematic on fast platforms. One thing that annoyed me was that their stages in the middle give way to Crash and Coco, you practically retrace half stage already completed and this takes away a lot of sense from their presence, not to mention that there is a jump narrative between Tawna and Dingodile in the Entropy area.Many have complained, understandably, about the length of the stages, but I have to say that up until the futuristic world it wasn't a burden for me. I also made the ""inverted"" versions and I kept an average of 3/4 diamonds out of 6, managing to unlock half of them in the penultimate dimension, as well as collecting skins for Coco and Crash, at least until the snowy world, then the request for 8 /9 gems was starting to be really too expensive. Nothing extraordinary, just enough to have fun and feel like I didn't waste the game. Mostly I used Crash, because even if in this game the two brothers are equal, I consider him the only true protagonist, however, I noticed that for Coco's skins there was a sort of fear in creating her outfits pretty, since the only one that could be defined as feminine is 1920s style and has funereal tones. Not that it matters in any way, are purely aesthetic elements, what matters is the gameplay but... let's say that, overall, so even including Crash, many skins aren't really that great.Currently I stopped the game in the second stage of the last world. Unfortunately I have to admit that the flames on the swirling platforms, were where my patience snapped. Expecting the worst, I had decided to take a few days off... and as often happens, you end up dedicating yourself to something else.At first glance it seems that T.f.B wanted to compete with the legacy of ""Naughty Dog"" and mainly emulated the first Crash, recognized today as the least balanced, also due to design defects, defects which, however, given its sections shorter ones were less heavy. Rumors say that it was a misinterpretation due to the habit of testing levels, which led to increasing the challenge, especially collecting. A better test might have done well.What is certain is that the release was too close to the trilogy, the sales scarce compared to excessive expectations and the cancellation of another project for an animated series means losing new potential fans. Even the attempt to make cash with the ""Gaas"" Team Rumble honestly does not bode well. I sincerely fear that we will see our dear Bandicoot friends again not any time soon. Well... unless Microsoft succeeds in acquiring ActiBlitz and has a more aggressive policy. Currently it seems complicated.";7/10;27 January 2023;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
34;Unity Technologies;Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time;Ridiculously difficult yet addictive game!;I had this for Christmas- I loved the crash series, so was excited to try Crash 4 its about time.The graphics are amazing and the little jump Landing locator is a nifty feature and proved very useful.The levels had some retro feel to them while being fresh for this generation of gamers.But the difficulty OH MY GOD. It is so frustrating but so addictive, you can't just give up you have to finish it.The power suits are a good feature too, and the more lower suits you unlock the more difficult the game becomes. Trying to switch quickly between suits to get past space. The final level..... took me A-LOT of tries I just kept getting frazzled in the castle! But when I completed it I felt like I'd really accomplished something! Its a fantastic game, don't aim for 100% you'll never do it or die trying.;9/10;2 July 2022;1 out of 3 found this helpful.
35;Unity Technologies;Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time;Unnecessarily Difficult;By far the worst game designed. Whilst the graphics on each level are absolutely amazing and creative, the level design is abysmal.A small percentage of levels you complete are fine and capable of doing in a few deaths. However, a large number of levels are ridiculously difficult. The game is designed around doing the levels at a fairly quick pace but a lot of the times you have to die in order to understand what you need to do next. And when you have to die to see what comes next and you're really far from your last checkpoint, it's very demotivating.A lot of levels have too much going on. Unless you have the reaction time of a superhero, you are not going to beat a level without dying. Checkpoints sometimes are so far away and you have to continuously cry and hope you reach it before the controller is launched across the room.Unless you crave frustration, anger, boiling blood and shouting, this is not the game for you.;1/10;14 February 2021;14 out of 22 found this helpful.
36;Unity Technologies;Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time;What the hell were the game developers thinking?;I've always been a big fan of Crash Bandicoot and the cast of characters. Granted Ive only played the original trilogy and outside of that a little of Crash Bash, CTR and Mind Over Mutant. They were great but cant beat the original trilogy for obvious reasons. They were fun and challenging with some really cool level designs. Also when it came to the difficulty for the original trilogy, they were tough but fairCrash Bandicoot It's about time is sadly the worst Crash Bandicoot game ever made and worst one in the franchise, Im sorry. A lot of the level designs are beautiful and can tend to be quite fun at times. However when it comes to the difficulty it is off the charts. When I started playing this for the first time two weeks ago I was only 4 levels in and was already struggling. Like seriously? That's never happened to me when I played Crash 1, 2 or 3But wait. It gets. As I progress through every level in every time rift world, the difficulty gets harder and harder until it goes from challenging to tedious. I hate everything that is tedious. When the difficulty of the game or anything else is tedious, it's not fun nor worth the effort in finishing. I was determined to beat the game and then throw it in the trash because it wasnt fun to play Crash 4 everytime I put the disc in, it was work and a real choreVideo games arent meant to be chore or work, they are meant to be fun. Yes games should definitely be challenging at times because otherwise every game would be boring and not worth playing. However when it came to Crash Bandicoot 1 the very original game as hard and difficult it was, it was still fair. But not Crash 4 It's about time. It's not fair at all or challenging, just tediousI got to the second to the last level and after two weeks of raging and slowly no longer having fun and losing interest, I gave up and threw it in the trash. I already knew how the story ended anyway when I watched the gameplay from a Youtuber back in late 2020. The second to the last level was the last straw when it required you to balance and time every mask you use in it while avoiding lasers and trying to platform. To many lasers, TNT, Nitros and trying to change from mask to mask hoping you'll make it through trial and error was not worth it. This level Im talking about is Cortex Castle, look it up and see for yourselfHell, I stopped caring about trying to get most of the boxes and look for gems by the time I got to the 5th time rift world and just wanted to beat the level through trial and error no matter how many times I died and I did. But Cortex Castle was the last straw for me. Never againIt's a shame because I liked the story for Crash 4 and where some of the levels you can play as Cortex, Dingodile or Tawna. Those were great. But the insane tedious difficulty that kept getting more and more ridiculous from the second world and up just killed and ruined it for me. Hey fair play and much respect to those that not only beat but also got every box and gems. Kudos.;3/10;31 March 2023;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
37;Unity Technologies;Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time;This is not Crash Bandicoot;So disappointed with this game, ive been a nonstop Crash fan since the first release, played 1-3 probably few thousand times and every Crash game to date.This game is so ridiculous in a way that it caters ONLY to the hardcore gamers. Crash 1 was legit hard but average players can still beat it and have fun. The difficulty of this game consists mostly of 2 things: The length of the maps and the camera angle behind Crash which is so zoomed out that its hard to control where he will land, thats why they added the location marker under Crash which i thought was a decent fix but poor design nonetheless.Best Crash games have Crash zoomed in more (just like some of the maps in this game like Nitro Processed which is actually one of the few maps that i liked).The length of the maps are so ridiculous because its EVERY map and they are so tedious that each hindrance is just repeated again and again. It feels so lazy, uninspired and uncreative, because most maps actually have 1-2 good ideas that the whole map consists of.ND did this sometimes like in Crash 1 but it was mostly the 2 stages of going over the bridge which were relatively short because they were so brutal.Here its every map and they are so ridiculously tedious.The audio for this game is very boring, best songs are poor remixes of the masterpieces from ND.The only reason i give it a 2 is because of good graphics and cutscenes. I thought they were the best part about this game and i liked how Dingodile was expanded and become a retired good guy. Kinda like Crash Bash.Anyway i regret purchasing this game on sale because i've already uninstalled after beating the game because i just dont wanna go through those maps again. I liked that they added content and more characters but alot of it is just lazy (like reverted diamonds and different colors for bosses) or super hard like finding all the stupidly well hidden boxes while not dying - Just isnt fun at all.I had a miserable time beating this game because i dreaded every single level where Crash never got to breathe or slide or anything. Every map is clustered with endless hindrances every step and thats just not Crash and never has been. The masks were remaked from Wrath but i consider that game vastly superior. Its the true 4.I've never been this critical of a Crash game and i played Titans which were terrible but i knew that at time and i wasnt hyped for those releases.;1/10;11 December 2020;8 out of 21 found this helpful.

The story was good, tedious at moments but very enjoyable. It was clever, violent, unpredictable and well paced, which is all I want from an assassins creed game. The ending was good but very unimpressive, for both animus and real world endings. Also I absolutely hate the fact that you have to buy another 3rd of the game offline. Just ridiculous, they make the add ons and extras look so interesting and conclusive and then charge you nearly what the game its self is worth to play them.

40;Unity Technologies;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;More of the same and yet different enough to give it solid 9/10;"When I compare AC Valhalla to AC Odyssey I have to admin one thing - while Odyssey represented the ancient Greece with all its beauty and ""pristine"", AC Valhalla represents Europe's dark ages and England in particular at ITS BEST. You can almost smell the blood & gore, the dirt, the mud, the cruelty and the darkness that ruled Europe between V and XIV century. Ubisoft simply nailed it!The graphics are incredible, I can walk England's fields for hours just watching the environment, the cities or the Roman Empire ruins. The story is griping enough to keep you hooked with memorable characters and there are more than enough side activities to perform in order to make you looking for more of ""what's behind that hill"" exploration. The combat is fluid and compared to previous AC games a bit different which brings some fresh air. Developing your viking settlement also brings sense into the material grind fest - i.e. plundering middle ages monasteries and also brings the feeling of a ""virtual"" community you're bound to.I have only few complaints such as: the voice acting - although it's traditionally good, more of the time it sounds like the actors are talking in a large hall rather than in the open field under a treeDifficulty - even at the highest difficulty, the game feels too easy - once you cover the ""power"" level for a certain zone and exceed it - you start simply feeling like a demigodAll in all - for me AC Valhalla is a solid 9/10 and must play for the fans of the previous games / the Witcher series";9/10;27 November 2020;6 out of 9 found this helpful.
41;Unity Technologies;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;One of the Greatest Assassin's Creed Games Ever!;I've been excited for this game for a long, LONG time. This might shock you, but I really liked Origins and Odyssey. I didn't love those two games, but I can see why both of them won critical acclaim and why they went into the Game Awards for game of the year. Again, I enjoyed those games, but I don't love them. Assassin's Creed Valhalla is simply amazing and exactly what I've been looking for in this new direction they're taking this series.If you don't like RPGs, you probably won't like this game. If you don't like upgrading your character and grinding your weapons to become stronger, you probably won't like this game. If you're like me, someone who's been a fan of this franchise since Black Flag, then this is the type of game that will definitely win you over like it won me over. Assassin's Creed Valhalla is one of the greatest games in the entire franchise. I would go out my way and call it one of my favorite games of 2020.Valhalla makes you feel like a viking, but you can upgrade your character to play like an assassin. Stealth is back and better than I imagined. No, it's not the best kind of stealth and it's not just go up to somebody and assassinate him all the time. Blending in with people? Now that's what I'm talking about, and that's what was lacking from the past two games... and it looks really good.The storytelling is amazing. The gameplay and combat are great. The visuals are great on both the PS4/PS5 and the Xbox One/Xbox Series X. The voice acting is awesome (Come on... it's Cnut from The Last Kingdom playing Eivor? Who would say no?!). The music is masterful. The sound design is awesome. This game is just so awesome!Assassin's Creed Valhalla is definitely a game I recommend to every AC fan and RPG fans. It's one of the best games I've ever played in 2020, it's truly amazing. Even though, in my opinion, the Ezio games are so much better, Valhalla has enough elements to allow you to enjoy it. I wholeheartedly recommend gamers this game to play and enjoy it. 10/10. Amazing game!;10/10;10 November 2020;65 out of 105 found this helpful.

It doesn't feel like the map is just there for filling like in odyessy where you just get bored. The quests are pretty fun and the cities are fun to explore. I love to build my settlement and just explore the region. There are few sexual content which are mostly just missing but it's just a quick peck on the lips. I originally bought this for my son that is 12 but I enjoy playing it with him and I was playing late at night.

44;Unity Technologies;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Fun & Engaging;I have to admit, I haven't visited the franchise in a while, as I didn't play neither of the two previous games. However, I've always been a fan of it for a while, having played 8 out of the first nine installments. As the last game I played was AC Syndicate, the new approach into a more RPG style came to me as a surprise (to be sure), but a welcome one! I am not a person who plays my games for a long time, few games can catch my attention for more than the campaign's duration, but AC Valhalla has been terribly fun, and I've just reached 50 hours of gameplay, although I'm each day more eager to continue exploring the riches of pre-unification England. For sure among the most fun I've had with any open world game. This new style brings a breath of fresh air to the franchise, opening more doors than it closes for the future of the saga. Can't wait to see what the future holds for Assassin's Creed!;10/10;6 January 2021;5 out of 7 found this helpful.
45;Unity Technologies;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;A good concept lacking in execution;"I have been waiting for this game all year and I'm sorry to say I'm very disappointed with it. It almost feels as though it's release was very rushed. The game is full of a lot of ""nearly"" moments. It nearly meets expectations with various features but falls short. Sadly, the combat is not great. Very clunky fighting. I was a huge fan of AC Odyssey and had high hopes for this game. Sadly it falls short. The worst thing is that there are so many things in this game (raids, battles...) that are so promising but certain things take away from it. The audio during battles is not great. When raiding a village, you expect to hear loud metal clashing, shouting from panicked civilians and war cries. However, the audio during battle scenes is very underwhelming, which detracts from the concept of raiding. Overall, this was a ""nearly"" game. With such great concepts and things to do, it ""nearly"" achieved them, but fell short.";6/10;16 December 2020;24 out of 30 found this helpful.

50;Unity Technologies;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;100+ hours opinion.;"I read some comments, and think I played different game. But I guess everyone is seeing it in their own eyes. Let me start by saying this game is the worst of last three./+ Settlement upgrading and overall feel of home base. It was fun and interesting to find all these activities, to decorate it and so on. /- Shop system. How in the hell I can't see what kind of Tatoo or decoration I am buying before I buy it? /+ Weapon and Armor upgrades. Simple to understand and to use. Can use the same Axe during whole game if I want to and it won't be under powered. /- Arrows. The fact that I can't make arrows, but have to find them in the woods infuriated me more than it should have. /+ Voice acting. Played as Male. Loved it. /- Mistakes in dialog. I was called ""SHE"" more times than once or twice. Hard to imagine how simple things like that can slip during test runs. /+ Fighting it self. Quite simple and easy to do. Doesn't require a lot of practice. /- LOGIC This one is a big one. And I am not talking about reality VS game. Some examples:1. I climb a wall to open some gates and let my troops in, but somehow they already fighting on this side of the gates. 2. Prisoners have their weapons on them then I rescue them. I know you can do better cause in Odyssey prisoners would take weapons from racks after I freed them./+ Size. It is really big world to run around. /- MAIN story. No spoilers so won't go into details, but I was extremely disappointed how ending was.. blunt and dull. I was like: ""What do you mean, ""thats it?"""" . /- SIGURD story. It has a big build up and felt it's gonna be something special but it as well was awkwardly disappointing. /- PRESENT story. I guess we are divided in those who like present and those who doesn't. I personally think that after Desmond they didn't find a proper idea. And now they are just holding on to it as strange identity thing, that I really hate. /+ QUEST for conquering. Most of them felt good and fun to complete. Enjoyed most of them. +/- RAID. I guess raids are like identity for Valhalla.and mostly they are fun to do. However had to load a game more than enough times to be annoyed by the bugs then could not get my crewmates to help me open door or chest. +/- SIDE quest. (Blue dots). Trying to engage you but most of them don't succeed in capturing your focus and interest. /- Hunting. the fact that i need to kill 2 or 3 hares just to get 1 hare foot is laughable, irritating and to be fair - cruel. Feels like devs decided to make ti grinding experience for those who wants to finish all hunter quests. (PS: Killed 5 black bears - didn't get fur even once.) /- Cinematic. I was so disappointed then at one point Eivor in the cinematic (and short fighting sequence that followed) was with different hair and beard style and even different color than the one I played with.Could really talk more but I think it will be enough. To summarize I will say that this game feels like no one played it after it was made, so there are so many bugs, glitches and simple mistakes that at some times I would just save and turn it off. I say that while understand that big and large games like that can't be without false. I played 100+ hours so I got my money worth for sure. However, I would not call this game triple A game. Not by the standards some other games raise today.";4/10;21 November 2020;55 out of 70 found this helpful.
51;Unity Technologies;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;One of the best AC games in my oppinion!;This game is just awesome! Being a huge consumer of AC games (I finished AC 1, 2, 3, Black Flag, Unity, Odyssey and have 100% Syndicate and Origins) I am not disappointed by this one! Firstly, it is simply magnificent, the most beautiful to date and having an entry-level gaming pc, it holds up with high / super high graphic settings at almost constant 30 fps. However, the game keeps the same recipe in its combat gameplay as AC Origins and Odyssey (which I personally enjoy but I know that not everyone does ) so make sure you enjoy this type of gameplay, the same goes for the infiltration phases, which are rarely encouraged, in favor of a frontal attack (which is great during strong attacks, but I still miss the infiltration mechanics that we used to find before). In terms of history, I do not have a titanic progression for the moment but I can still say that for the early game the missions are well written, even if of course they do not compete against a The Witcher 3 or AC 2. The vocal interpretation of Magnus Bruun (who plays male Eivor) is in my opinion more than perfect! Finally let's talk about the world, which remains the key point of the success of ubisoft open world. It is in my opinion incredibly well done, as much for its breathtaking large-scale landscapes, its huge Saxon towns as well as the smallest details of a small abandoned hut on top of a mountain in a Norwegian fjord, this world is quite simply beautiful and alive, and knows how to surprise us and arouse our curiosity and our thirst for discovery. To conclude, if you enjoyed the gameplay of Origins and Odyssey or if you want to get started in the world of AC, this game is for you and I recommend it 100% !! However, if you are a hardcore old AC fan and have doubts about the gameplay of recent AC games, you can go your way, even if you miss the opportunity to visit in my opinion one of the most beautiful open worlds that video games have ever known (purely personal opinion).;10/10;14 November 2020;11 out of 22 found this helpful.
52;Unity Technologies;Assassin's Creed Valhalla;Not for everyone but a great experience;At this point Assassin's Creed has become the Fast and Furious of video games but I'm ok with that. Valhalla has an immersive story that brings in familiar music and gameplay from the beloved beginnings with new characters, stories, and freedom that is making this game the awesome game it is. I started playing as the female but changed to the male Eivor 30 hours in because while she has a good voice actor, the story does not flow well and I find it hard to become attached to female Eivor unlike playing as Kassandra in Odyssey whom I would simp for hard. My issue? There are too many places you can get your character stuck and have to reload. A few times is expected and funny but when it's consistent that's when it gets annoying. The ability tree is overwhelming at first but it gets easy to work with the more you play and discover how you are wanting to play stories and just as a dope viking assassin. There's a lot to explore and so many ways to approach every situation that it really is your way to play. It keeps me interested but I do prefer Assassin's Creed Odyssey;9/10;10 December 2020;5 out of 8 found this helpful.

66;Epic Games;Fortnite;Either you love it or hate it;"To me, Fortnite is a cash grab for epic games, designed to be colorful, bright and fun. As I get into my 30's, I find myself less & less interested in playing newer video games. They're getting way too complicated to follow along with anymore. A vast majority of games being made now are what I like to call ""Interactive movies"" where players can follow a storyline and not actually play a game. Back in the 1970s & 1980s, those were games, there were no storylines or if there were, they didn't really matter. I have grown tired of playing interactive movies at this point.And this leads me to admit that I have been playing Fortnite since 2019 now and I still like it. The game is simple enough for me to play, and anyone can pick it up and play it. The storylines don't really matter, they're there in case you feel like going along with them. The original characters are colorful and cute, and the well-known heroes & heroines are there to draw in the older crowd. While a Gen Z might be content with the colorful characters introduced every season, older players like myself often choose to run around the island gunning down bots as Kratos from God of War, Master Chief from Halo, Ripley from the Alien films or the Predator from the 1987 film.However, I'm a grown man so I don't get to practice this game much compared to some of the other players, many of whom are in another stratusphere of talented at this game. Fire one shot at them, and they're building a fort that looks like those old lego commercials where the smiling kid is putting together the set, but the footage is sped up ridiculously fast. Compare that to the numerous bots included to fill out the island to make 100 players. Picking off a bot feels rewarding when you first play but after a few weeks of playing, the bots are a joke. Picking off a human opponent, it's either a challenge or ridiculous, but picking off a player with a username that advertises a Gaming channel on youtube? Satisfying.However, I see how Fortnite is part of the modern era of gaming - it's free to play, but it's full of content that you need to pay about 10$ every 3 months to enjoy. That's how we've gone from paying $50-$60 once for a game, and it was ours, forever if we wanted to keep it. The game's creators made a big chunk of money once from the game, and that was that. Now, They make the game ""free to play"" but nickel & dime the player. In some ways, that's fair, because piracy has often eaten into a gaming company's profits. In other ways, some players have paid hundred for battle passes every 3 months and V-bucks for the endless special content that is advertised. Yeah, it's cool to play as your favorite superheroes and TV & movie characters, Some you can unlock for free, but others can cost well over $10.I get the hate for this game too. Everyone has a right to hate Fortnite for what it is, and how some ""sweaty"" players can ruin the game for someone just trying to have fun. If you don't take it too seriously, and you're content with the battle passes, which are loaded with added content, you can still have fun. I'm not a ""hotel with WiFi builder"" like some players are, but if I can make it to the last 10 players on the map and score a few eliminations before getting picked off by a sweaty player, i'm not mad. Once in a while, I can win matches, sometimes against sweaty players.Fortnite is not for everyone. If you hate it, maybe colorful online shooters are just not your thing. Let the people who enjoy them, enjoy them.";8/10;4 February 2022;6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Chapter 1 is by far the best chapter ever, best map, best guns, best graphics. Everything about this part of Fortnite was perfect. They ruined it later though in S10. Ian season 10 they decided to add robots that shot a million missiles and shotgunned you to death. This was the downfall of fortnite. The game literally added a teaming device into SOLOS!!!

78;Epic Games;Gears of War;One of the ultimate multiplayer military strategy games;In GEARS OF WAR you control Marcus Fenix, a disgraced squad leader of the forces of the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG). After his cohorts help him to escape from prison, he takes his squad to attempt to thwart the onslaught of the Locust Horde and to destroy their network of tunnels within Planet Sera. An optional second player can join in and control comrade Dominic.In this third-person shooter, you must make judicious use of all available cover in order to succeed without being wiped out very quickly. When under cover you can shoot from behind it either by poking your head out to have a look at what you're shooting, or you can blind- fire (meaning that you can just poke your gun out without having to look, which is safer but lacks the accuracy of viewed firing). You can also roll to one side or the other to hopefully get to the next bit of cover quicker, if you are on one side of a door you can quickly spin to the other side, or you can jump over your cover (if it's low enough). There is even an option to run lower and more quickly towards the next bit of cover (provided that it's not too far away), which can be advisable if you are in the open too long as being lower and quicker makes you harder to hit.You have a multitude of weapons at your disposal, most of which have limited ammunition (which can be picked up if it's lying on the ground, or you can top up a lot of weapons for which you do not have full ammo). There are various kinds of pistols and other handguns, although really these are only advisable if you don't have a bigger gun to use. Bigger guns come in a variety of sorts, with possibly the most well-known one being the Lancer, which has the much-talked-about chainsaw bayonet for close-quarters combat. Whereas with some of the other weapons you can strike with the butt of the gun, with the chainsaw bayonet you can rev it up and enjoy something of a guilty pleasure as your character swings the blade into the foe, ripping its skin apart and sending dark red blood jetting upwards, even spraying your screen! (Don't worry, you can still see through it and it does quickly fade). There is quite a bit of gore in GOW, but by far the chainsaw bayonet is among the goriest imagery in the game.Other bigger guns include (but are not limited to) the shotgun and the sniper rifle, although its chamber can only accommodate one bullet, so you have to reload after every shot.Reloading presents an extra facet which, when mastered, will allow quicker reloading and more powerful shots. When you start to reload a reload bar appears, with a meter running from left to right. when it reaches the right of the bar your gun will be reloaded. However, if you can stop the meter when it's within a small marked section of the bar which is about a third of the way across you will gain the aforementioned quicker reload and the accompanying benefits.Also available are frag grenades, although you can only have up to four of these. When you use these you can either just throw them or you can aim using an on-screen arc that shows where your grenade will bounce and where it will explode.There are also some other more powerful weapons, which I won't give away, but these should understandably be saved for the more troublesome foes.When you take a hit you start to see a red cog appear on the screen. the more complete it is the closer you are to dying, so get under cover quickly! If it turns into a fully intact cog with a skull in the middle the screen goes bright red and you are dead (unless you're in multiplayer mode, where another player can go up to you and revive you).Graphics are dark and moody, sometimes genuinely scary and very gory. There are bits later on where a small swarm of creatures known as Kryll will kill anyone who strays into shadowy areas for too long. Sound is equally cool, although some of the dialogue has voices that aren't quite up to the same standard.Gameplay is simple enough to pick up, and all the various actions are well thought-out, with one button being a context-sensitive button, where your character might flick a switch, kick open a door or turn a valve. Before too long you will be ducking under cover and taking pot- shots at the foes like a seasoned COG war veteran.If I did have one minor complaint, the scenes in rocky sections (e.g. caves) seem too artificial, almost as if they had been designed to contain cover (I know they have, but it still seems artificial). In the building-related scenes the cover is justified and logical (e.g. church pews in churches, fountains outside, pillars, bits of broken walls, windows etc), but when you see conveniently-placed rocky outcroppings to hide behind it somehow detracts slightly from the immersive experience that GOW otherwise offers. Another complaint involves the grenades in multiplayer mode. some details of the aiming arc can be off-screen if playing using two-player split-screen, which can make them harder to use than normal.However, GOW stands out as a brilliant game in its own right, and is probably the main reason for investing in an XBox 360, especially in multiplayer mode.;9/10;1 January 2007;12 out of 12 found this helpful.

You fight an alien/monster horde called the Locusts, and old-school shooter style, there are large bosses you must kill every so often.

85;Epic Games;Gears of War;Gears is the best xbox360 game that i have ever played;Gears Of War is the best game on xbox360 maybe even best game I've played all year.With the best graphics i have ever seen on any system.The environments and surrounding ruin of cities looks great like an actual bombed out city.The A.I. in G.O.W is decent not to great though they are kinda dumb all they do is attack and take cover.Sound is awesome on it the guns sound great and the voice acting is really good done by professionals.The story is great just too short for my liking but its well done and when the soldiers talk they talk like real soldiers would by making jokes and trying to keep the morale up.Its a little sad to say but the way the soldiers act in this fictional war game is more real than they act in a real war game(my friend in the army told me thats exactly the way him and his company act).Actual game play of G.O.W is very easy and simple to get into and the firefights you'll be having are amazing just intense fire fights with taking fire and returning fire a decent variety of weapons makes the games fire fights fun.Taking cover is crucial to game play but its not as bad as it may sound you don't have to take cover for minutes at a time there are plenty of chances to run out and gun the Locusts down.All in all this is a great game worth buying if your a shooter fan or want a fun game to play its a most own for any 360 owner if they like action games at all.;10/10;15 January 2007;7 out of 8 found this helpful.

The single player, while the story wasn't exactly amazing, and the campaign wasn't exactly that long, the game play is amazing. AMAZING! ""Stop and pop"" is the way to play this game, as once said by Cliffy B.The campaign is relatively easy on the lower difficulty, but when you ramp up the difficulty to Hardcore or Insane once you've unlocked it, this game will make you tear your hair out in frustration. I've beaten the game on Insane, it was difficult. Very difficult.The multi-player is better. I don't even know how that's possible. But it is. The thrill of pulling off that head-shot with the sniper rifle or killing three people from the same blast from the Hammer of Dawn, it never gets old.Oh, the Hammer of Dawn is a giant space laser.The only complaint is that you can't break the chainsawing animation, so when you clearly could've dodged the blade in real life, you aren't allowed to move, unless it glitches, and even then, you die when they're not near you.Overall this game will make you tear your hair out.

87;Epic Games;Gears of War;Chainsaw Charlie;"Some twelve years after its initial release, I've finally found the time to sit down with a copy of ""Gears Of War"" and give it a playthough. Please note, I'm playing the original 360 version, on an Xbox One via the backwards compatibility, and not the remastered release. My initial feelings about the campaign weren't, if I am honest, that great. A jumbled back story I soon decided to ignore led to a dull abandoned locations and repetitive encounters as small groups of enemies lumbered from ground to fall fairly quickly. The cover mechanic was cumbersome and fiddly and the game was really buggy, prescribed actions failed to kick in and on one occasional I climbed up a ladder which then glitched me to the middle of the roof and I had to restart. However, the further I got into the game, the more it improved. Generic corridors opened to towns squares and houses that needed to be defended from the (admittedly still pretty recurring) invasions. From there, the enemies and weapon types mix it up and bit, but it's the boss fights that remain the most memorable aspects of the game. I did get a better grip on the controls, although throughout the entire playthrough I kept snapping into cover when I was trying to jump out of the way. The active reload was a good addition though and it's one of the best game mechanics I've experienced - when you get the reload spot on, in the heat of battle and take down an enemy. I never did really get a handle on who the characters were and what we were really supposed to be doing but ignoring all that and just going in the direction it seemed to want me to go, and shooting what crawled from the ground became entertaining enough. And then, almost too quickly, it was over. The campaign was probably around ten hours for me, on the standard difficulty setting and trying to look around as much as possible for the cogtags. I can only imagine what the experience was like to play the game for the first time in 2006, but in 2018, though it lacks the wow factor to compete with an AAA game now, I don't regret finally catch up.";7/10;11 September 2018;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
88;Epic Games;Gears of War;Great graphics, weak storyline and game play...;Don't get me wrong Gears of War is a good game, but its not as good as people say it is, it doesn't live up to the hype, the graphics however are beautiful and are a joy to watch, the cinematic scenes are cool to,but the game play gets a bit boring, you find yourself doing the same through out most of the game, ducking covering, shooting,walking, ducking covering ,shooting, walking. if u never get bored of shooting the same enemy through out then this is the game for you.Its not a terrible game though, I would call it good, but at times boring.Some of the weapons are really cool and great to use like the hammer of dawn, some of it is really artistic and creative to,once again it is a good game, not a great game.;6/10;29 September 2007;4 out of 11 found this helpful.
89;Epic Games;Gears of War;If you own an XBOX 360, you are lost without Gears until you buy it!;I am not a major gamer, but when I heard about Gears of War and that it is better than the Halo series, I bought it. The graphics were superb, the music was outstanding and matched the game-play. WOWOWOWOW the game-play! Freakin' amazing weapons.... the chainsaw gun..... the Hammer of Dawn! Gears of War is a game that will be a classic. The actual storyline is a bit too short, but the nice thing is that once you beat the game, you can play again on harder levels. Gears is the most addictive game i have ever played other than Guitar Hero II. Even if you die in the game, you'll want to jump back into the action. I would give this game 9 1/5 out of 10 and if you would like more information or help please look at my comment board;9/10;1 January 2007;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
90;Epic Games;Gears of War;Revolutionary and brilliant!! 10/10;"This is a classic game. This spectactular shooter became an award winning game that totally lived up to the hype. So good that they made two sequels, one prequel and a spin of (Gears 4). Gears 5 is also in progress and four novels have been written. Television series/documentaries exists about this game. In our gaming history GoW is piece of art and history. Gears is one of the most memorable and and celebrated series/sagas in the world of gaming in our history. Gears is the father and the invention of the cover based shooters. Gears of War was the start of a new era of gaming mechanics.Gameplay: Shooting have never felt better. Tons of kick-ass shooting and tactical military-content. As I said the invention of the cover system. This game is built up by cover, you can hide behind everything. Quickly jump from one place to another. Or run while crouching to avoid bullets. This running and the fast swap between covers are very useful and fun to use. Controls are easy but very useful and good. I mean gameplay is the best part of this game. Gunplay runs smooth and feels great together with some heavy cool weapons. The gore and the chainsaw kill are amazing. Gameplay is so fun and i still return today to play this game. Bosses are nothing special, but it brings variety and joy to the game. This game is meant for co-op which is much better and funnier. Especially the split-screen which is nice to see. If you have a lovely sibling, parent, boy/girlfriend or just a friend at your home it's feels good to be able to bring up a game and socially play together at one couch. 10/10.Graphics: 2006 this was the best looking game and it still holds up. The graphics looks promising. Detailed environments and character models. A dark and gritty atmosphere lies over this game and I love it. It is fitting to the world we play in and the story. Cut scenes are also very cinematic which is nice to see. When you're not enjoying the gameplay you can enjoy the cutscenes which looks good. For being 2006 and still holds up today there's nothing you can complain on. 10/10.Story: Well there's not much going on in the plot. The game starts up pretty quick and rushed without any explanation of what's really going on. I mean Marcus prison sentence could be explained a lot more. I know the sequels, the books and the remaster fixed this criticism so I'm not seeing this as a huge problem but it made me confused when I first played it. This game was gameplay-focused after all. The story that exists is interesting I must say. The trailer really made me buy this game. Marcu Fenix is breaken out of prison and sent on a mission to destroy the Locust stronghold. This is a dark tale of humanity struggle and a desperate fight for survival and peace. Gears of War brings a depressing tone to a dark bitter story. Running around in a city were civilisation and lives are gone is scary and they made it so well done. Marcus and his team feels real and believable. The humor is fun but not too comic or excessive. I know that fellow soldiers talk like that in real life to hide the fear. But running around and listen to their small dialogues is enjoyable. Their adventure and the problems they face on the way makes this little ""road movie""-feeling and the heroic ending gave me goosebumps. The final train mission was the best. 9/10.Multiplayer is super fun.This game is a masterpiece and one of my all time favorites!";10/10;21 June 2019;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
91;Epic Games;Gears of War;Great game, weak story.;Gears of War's biggest weakness is a interesting but bare bones plot but what it makes up for it is it's addictive and (very)gory intensely fun shooting action.What Epic Games has done is nothing short of brilliant and although not really original, the core gameplay mechanics are very well-done. Besides the critically-acclaimed Halo series, the focus on cover makes for some really exciting and strategically intense firefights. The graphics are really nice, detailed, and has a dark, gritty, medieval-industrial/Gothic hybrid feel that fits really well with the atmosphere. The voice acting is a little cheesy but it's supposed to be this way. It feels like the action flicks of the '80s and '90s.However, Gear's major flaw is the story. Nothing is even remotely explained. not even the real reason for why the bad guys want to destroy humanity. None of the characters are developed, even the Locust Horde and their leader, General Raam. The lack of any real development sucks what little life remains from the characters and it makes it a little depressing.Gears of War is a great action game marred only by a weak, paint by numbers plot with emotionally devoid characters.;8/10;21 January 2010;4 out of 6 found this helpful.
92;Epic Games;Gears of War;A duck and cover shooting military game.;I do not usually care for this type of game unless there is something interesting going on. In the case of this game it is the fact you are going against an army of monsters that are coming from within the earth. So that right there means it will not be the typical shooter or bland army game. So you have your super tough soldier you control, released from a prison because at this stage in the conflict the military needs all the help they can get. So you now must battle your way through the locust horde to reach various mission objectives all with the sole purpose of destroying the opposition. Fear not, though as you have other soldiers on your side, helping you with their firepower as well. You also get a vehicle to drive and plenty of weapons, though I really loved the default weapon best. A machine gun with a chainsaw bayonet. The sniper rifle was also cool. Plenty of monsters to shoot too, as you have your basic foot soldiers, your giant nearly indestructible monsters, bat type creatures that avoid light and others. So even though usually this type of game is not for me, this one was rather fun and exciting.;8/10;10 July 2007;3 out of 5 found this helpful.
93;Epic Games;Gears of War;More fun with 2 people but still great;This game probably shows one of the best graphics ever for a video game. Sound effects makes the game-play intense. But the best part of the game is online gaming and best of all CO-op. Gears of war is also the best 2 player game I've ever played. If u have trouble with a level, ask a friend and both of u can kick ass. Here are the pros and cons Pros: Graphics are absolutely gorgeous and one of the best i have ever seen -Sound effects are great -reloading is fun -chainsaw is hilarious -Best co-op ever -Great voice acting and cast Cons: Gameplay is very mediocre -Not that fun with 1 player -story isn't well presented;7/10;9 August 2007;2 out of 7 found this helpful.
94;Epic Games;Gears of War;Superb.;Gears of War is probably the best game on XBox 360 and definitely my favourite games.Every thing in the game has been done brilliantly and there's nothing i would change i'm not really a massive gamer so i can't say a lot but the game play and story are all excellent and i enjoyed every moment playing it, the co-op multi-player was great too.The graphics like most XBox 360 games are great and i really liked the characters and the locust hoard were really well designed, the idea of a chainsaw on a machine gun was cool and i love how the blood splash's on the screen when you use it.I would recommend Gears of War to anyone who likes third person shooter/horror games and would say it's the best around on console at the moment.I hope they don't make a Gears of War movie because most that get turned into movies are rubbish like Doom which wasn't that good.9 out of 10;9/10;1 November 2007;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This addition to the game has so many bugs. People faze through builds constantly. Also the timing is extremely important, and in this game the building can be inconsistent. Also, the lightsabers are by far the worst addition to the game ever. It feels like the creators were trying to make the game more fun for beginners, which is commendable. However, all it has accomplished is a random sequence of killing or getting killed by these weapons. It takes no skill whatsoever and it's extremely imprecise.;3/10;8 January 2020;8 out of 13 found this helpful.

115;Epic Games;Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2;Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2: Addictive classics renewed;PlotA remaster of the first two games in the Tony Hawk's franchise. It's set to bring back original levels, pro skaters, tricks, modes, and songs from the iconic soundtrackCastThe usual roster of Hawk associates such as Chad Muska, Kareem Campbell, Bob Burnquist and Eric Koston and weirdly Jack Black as Office Dick.VerdictI grew up with Tony Hawks games and became positively god like at them due to a combination of the hours I put in and them and myself just naturally clicking with the game and the controls. The thing is I never truly fell in love with them until THUG & THUG 2 namely Tony Hawks Underground and the wackiness of it all by comparison (Especially THUG 2). The trouble is that set the bar so high that coming back to Pro Skater quite frankly makes them look bad by comparison.Don't get me wrong these are fantastic titles and as a remastered bundle they're essential for fans of the series but for me it makes me frustrated that this will also likely be as close as I come to playing the Underground games again which are simpler superior in my opinion. They're Saints Row 3, these titles are Saints Row 2 and I mean that analogy in multiple ways.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1&2 are great titles, easy to pickup but brutal to master.RantsI miss the good ol' days with couch coop games, Tony Hawks was one of my most played. The trouble is I'd mastered the game to such an extent I was unbeatable so friends found themselves adjusting their strategy and would sabotage my combos by crashing into me.

122;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;Great game, but...;it's extremely DIFFICULT. I have been playing this game since it was like 2 years old, and I still haven't been able to beat it! That proves how wimpy modern N64 platform games have become, since I am able to easily defeat its 1996 counterpart.But the graphics for this game and its sometimes-cartridge-partner, Duck Hunt, seem quite advanced for 1985 and 1984 (respectively). At least compared to games like Excitebike (1984) and The Legend of Zelda (1986). The music is nice (although the dungeon and the castle music gets repetitive) and sound effects are cool. Once you've beaten this game, there's no need to play it anymore, but if you haven't, like me, you'll be wanting to keep playing until you beat it, and frustrated if you fail.But this game is the same age as me, and I still play it at my friends house if they're hogging the Super Smash Bros.

In a lot of these ""lush, 3-d environment"" games, it seems that fun and challenge have been sacrificed to the great god of graphics. I suggest that the game makers of today do some researching of the past.";10/10;23 December 1999;3 out of 3 found this helpful.

125;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;What makes this game a classic;I'm sure most people my age remember one or more situations like this: some guy your parents knew was celebrating his birthday and you went with your parents to the party. A lot of the other people also brought their kids and after a while you were all gathered in one room. You didn't really know each other that well, so what were you going to do? Well, the kid who's room it was had a Nintendo (or later Super Nintendo) or one of those pirated machines that played Nintendo games. The answer was: you played Super Mario! Everybody agreed that it was a fun game and everybody knew how to play it. It's simply the game of my generation.But what made this particular game so important and well liked? First of all, at the time it arrived it was revolutionary  the first side-scrolling platform game ever and it was the game that made both video games and Nintendo popular. The story was good even if it was simple: You are Mario the plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom and you are on a mission to save the princess that have been kidnapped by Bowser. At the time this game was released they usually didn't bother to come up with interesting stories for games, so it's not like today when a lot of games have complicated story lines. It wasn't hard to figure out how to play, jump and land on an enemy's head and you will kill him, but it still wasn't that easy to beat. (Of course it's easier know that I'm soon to be 21 and have played it as many times as I have.) Last but not least, the music suited the game perfectly.Something that to me is a sign that this is a good game is that it's still fun to play now when I'm almost 21, even though it was a game that was meant for kids (like all games that were released at that time) and the graphics are very out-dated. This is a game that a lot of people still play, it's been re-released both to Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance. Of course a lot of people download it and play it on emulators  even though Nintendo doesn't like that.For someone of my generation playing this game today is like re-living only the happy times of your childhood. When I played it as a kid I wasn't someone sitting in front of the TV playing a video game  I was Mario and I was on a very important mission to save the princess!10/10;10/10;11 July 2005;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
126;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;Perhaps The Only Perfect Video Game Ever Created;"After receiving my first Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, I instantly became hooked on one game in particular: Super Mario Brothers. It's relatively new style of play (side-scrolling) in combination with an original story and the perfect difficulty arc (anyone can beat the beginning levels, but it takes a true pro to complete the game) made it the game that I played over and over again. Whether it was screaming in frustration due to the Hammer Brothers, hearing in disbelief that the Princess ""was in another castle"", or the sheer joy of beating that next castle, I played the game over and over again. Of course, being such a young child, I was never quite talented enough to complete the complicated jump moves or decipher the complex mazes (towards the end) well enough to actually beat the game. Yet, I still had a heck of a time trying!Flash forward (LOST-style) 10-12 years later: Having been introduced to the NES at such a young age, I continued by brand loyalty to Nintendo by playing the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Gamecube, and Wii. I had a lot of good times with those machines, but one day I got the urge to fire up the old NES again, for old times sake. Within moments (well, not exactly moments, as it took some blowing on the connectors and jiggling the game up and down) I was instantly transformed back into that excited six year old kid who couldn't wait to come home from school and play Mario. This time around, with a little practice, I was able to conquer even the final Bowser.While playing the game at that older age, though, I was amazed at the purity of it. It was original (which can't be said about most SNES games), it was straight-forward (not like Donkey Kong '64, for example), it's difficulty arc progresses in a logical fashion (not like GCN, where in many games you have to be a master gamer to step right in), and the game's internal bugs are cute and looked forward too, not annoying and troublesome as is sometimes the case on the Wii.Thus, taking all those things into consideration, Super Mario Brothers for the NES is, at least in my opinion, perhaps the closest thing to a ""perfect video game"" as has ever been created. Not only did it practically save the entire gaming industry, but it also gave hours of entertainment to people across the world. To me, only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (for the '64) can challenge Mario Bros. in terms of overall game quality.So, if you are a nostalgic video gamer (like myself) who is a bit frazzled by the current obsessions and skill levels, I would highly recommend dusting of the old NES box and popping in Super Mario Brothers (it often comes on the same cartridge as Duck Hunt). After a few moments of dickering, a few tries to re-master the old skill-sets, you will NOT be disappointed.";10/10;12 March 2017;3 out of 3 found this helpful.

135;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;One of the early games for the Nintendo system, opened things up a lot.;"This game is basically simple fun. You play as plumber Mario and if you have a friend as Luigi traversing the lands of the mushroom kingdom trying to rescue Princess Toadstool. What set this one apart from other early Nintendo releases of the day is the varied levels and game play. Unlike say the game ""Duckhunt"" where you simply point gun at the screen and shoot and repeat or other games where the levels are basically the same and repetitive this one had different levels that really set things apart. Different enemies attack you and you have your boss type enemy at the end of a long journey through a set number of worlds in the kingdom, the end level always being a castle that contained a lot of lava and spinning fireballs. You also had to use strategy to defeat Bowser at the end of the levels because if you actually got through the castle with fire powers you could simply waste him with fireballs. If you were at least big it was fairly easy to get past him to get the ax that would send him into the lava, and if you were small you may have had a chance getting underneath him. Yes, by collecting a mushroom Mario would get bigger, and if you add a flower on top of that he hurls fireballs. You also got to go into underground type levels and ones underwater. Thankfully, unlike some characters in the video game world, Mario and Luigi could hold their breaths forever apparently in this game. The game was not entirely perfect, it was rather boring facing off against Bowser every time at the end and I thought the inclusion of Luigi was rather pointless as he was great in ""Mario Brothers"", but that game was a co-op game this one is not and you simply see him only if you have a friend that does not mind alternating turns. Still, it was a fun game certainly more so than say that horrible ""Gyromite"" game.";8/10;1 March 2010;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

137;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle! - Toad;"Incredible. The concept of a nice plumber (albeit an Italian stereotype) saving the princess instead of a gentleman or prince is quite original and good. Sort of the graphics were nice back then and are still excellent to this day. Generated three iconic power-ups from across the ""Mario"" series. Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman. Great music too. Top theme is very well known even if you have never played this game. Thank Nintendo for this amazing game. Flaws: Unlike ""Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)"" you cannot rewind. The game doesn't even have a continue unlike Sonic, if you lose your lives you HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN! At least there's a cheat that makes you pick up where you left off in the world.Fun fact: If you've lost all your lives, press and hold the ""A"" button on the NES until the title screen, and while holding, press Start on the NES.

138;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;The Best Video Game Ever Made;Bar none, Super Mario Brothers is the most purely enjoyable game of all time. Why? simply because you can play it for years on end and never get tired of it. Sure, it may not have the most in depth storyline or gaming options, but that just makes the game better. There's nothing to worry about except for beating bad guys and racing against the clock. Even the gameplay is perfect. Never once have I ever hit a glitch that ruined the gameplay.This game is truly a classic from all of our childhoods that made gaming fun. Screw GTA, Halo, Guitar Hero, and Pokemon... nothing will ever beat Super Mario Brothers... old school.;10/10;28 December 2008;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
139;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;Forever influential and forever fun;"At this point, I'm sure most of us are aware of just how dire the video game market was back in the old days. While the Atari 2600 was a very important and legendary console that's rightfully looked back fondly, the games only sometimes followed suit. and unlike the Nintendo Wii and DS, this was something the 2600 could NOT afford. This was all evident with the video game crash of 1982. Some blame games like the disastrous port of ""Pac-Man"" or the poor movie tie-in which was the infamous ""ET: Extra Terrestrial"" for Atari 2600 (which, despite it being poor, really isn't as bad as people say it was, in my opinion), but the real blame came from 2 things.One being hardware limitations, as the 2600, despite it being awesome, was undoubtedly very simple compared to anything afterwards. This made any and all games naturally constrained from really being anything all too special, which was fine in the late '70s, but when there's virtually no improvements to future games afterwards, it got stale quick. This transitions to the second thing, which was the overbearing quantity. To put it simply, there were way too many games for the console, and not enough of them were any good. Mix that with the fact that the 2600 was the first ever mainstream video game console to take itself seriously, and it's no wonder people thought it was all a passing fad at the end of the day.But in 1985, that all changed. Nintendo, formerly a card/toy company, not only threw their hat in the ring, but did a perfect job at it, as the Nintendo Entertainment System (or the NES) took everything Atari failed at, and made one of the best video game consoles of all time. all while geniusly marketing it as an entertainment system to help consumers trust that video games are awesome after all. Of course, that would only mean so much if the showcase game wasn't great.And great it was. ""Super Mario Bros"" is, without a doubt, the most important video game of all time, as it not only showcased how great a game could be with properly great vision, but also how great it could be when it's properly using the hardware it's running on. Putting aside the hardware logistics that helped this game even more, the game itself is an absolute joy. With excellent and iconic level design, responsive and fun gameplay, visuals that, while not the best we would see on the console, are much more full of life than any video game beforehand, and the iconic and forever memorable music, this game ticks every box, and would act as an essential pillar for video games as a whole for the rest of time. as evident by the fact that it's still infinitely fun and charming to this day-a moniker no other video game beforehand could use.Really, there's not much to complain about here. Some could make the argument that this game has aged, and is not as amazing as the famous plumber's future installments, but considering how this not only saved the industry, but also perfects the notion of enjoying expansive games that keeps the player hooked from start to finish even to this day, this game deserves nothing less than all of the credit. If you haven't played this yet (for some reason), I implore you to do so. Even for how slightly basic it is compared to later games, it's an important part of video game culture, and a still incredibly fun reminder on how amazing games can get once the guys behind really know what they're doing.";10/10;8 December 2022;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
140;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;One of the best Nintendo games I've ever played;SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, in my opinion, is one of the best Nintendo games I have ever played. Even though I've never owned a Nintendo system or games, I've played this game many times before. To be honest, I enjoy it very much. In addition, even though I've never made it to the last level, I still enjoy the game very much. When and if you can get a Nintendo Wii, this game should definitely be on your list of downloads. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the people at Nintendo know how to keep video game fanatics entertained. Now, in conclusion, if you're a video game fanatic, this is definitely one you'll want to play and own.;9/10;19 July 2007;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
141;Nintendo;Super Mario Bros.;Superb Mario crushes !;What can be said that hasn't already been said about one of the most deservedly lauded video games of all time? I received a NES (The Dunk Hunt) tie in console for Christmas of 1988. This followed months of me playing the game in my local Macro wholesalers, whenever I got the chance to go. It was a world away from the Spectrum games I was used to playing. It loaded instantly, not 10 minutes after I set the cassette playing. It loaded every time, and didn't crash if I looked at it the wrong way. It was in full colour, with better audio than I'd heard before and utilised a natural tactile controller that remains iconic today. And it is a brilliant game. Though not the first, it defined and perfected so much of what the platform genre would become. Level design is peerless - throwing another curveball at you every couple of levels, varying the challenge though never unfairly. Visually, of course it's not much to look at compared even to some later NES games, let alone something on a modern console. The music however, though basic, is probably the most iconic game soundtrack of all time. I still think that the best way of playing the game would be via the original NES console and using an original NES controller - but regardless of which version you play, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the true classics of gaming.;9/10;13 April 2018;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
142;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;Truly unique.;"IMDb isn't really a site designed for people to rate video games, but this entry is too much fun to not talk about, so I'll write a review anyways. If you look deeper into my ratings you'll notice how I gave all the Zelda games I've played a perfect 10. I love the series' storytelling, quirky characters, engaging puzzles and charming level designs, but I do often wonder if these games deserve such a high rating. They do slightly suffer from repetition (Ganon must have multiple lives!), and there are a few irritating glitches that can hinder my overall enjoyment. Which is fine because, after buying the Nintendo Switch and trying this game out for a few good hours, I think this game is worth all the hype. And what hype it has!In short, this game is an absolute blast. Open-world games have been done before (Skyrim), yet every little detail, every little technique, and the various ways you could go about on your adventure make this huge world feel fresh and exciting. There is so much to do in this game, and it never gets boring! Link could climb up steep cliffs, transport to towers, paraglide, and enter ""Shrines"" to solve puzzles by using magic in clever ways. Even the horse-riding was fun! I love how immersive this world is, because everything (graphics, controls, gameplay) is so flawlessly executed and so absorbing. It breaks a few video game conventions we're so used to, making this game an exciting, entertaining ride filled with smooth game-play and fun characters. I haven't gotten too deep into the game yet, so I can't really comment on the main storyline too much. So far it has the typical Zelda formula, but with an interesting techno-twist that doesn't feel misplaced. The character interactions are natural, and the quests push the story forward instead of making them feel like filler. So far a good start.Overall, this game is innovative, breathtaking, challenging, imaginative and endlessly addicting. I believe this is one of Nintendo's most well-crafted games they've made, and I'm not saying this out of pure nostalgia. If you're a Zelda fan, a casual gamer, or someone that thirsts for adventure, this is a great choice.";9/10;9 March 2017;44 out of 51 found this helpful.
143;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;A True Masterpiece that may be the Greatest Video Game ever made!;"Easily one of the greatest games of all time, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild delivers a satisfyingly beautiful presentation on scale, world building, story, gameplay, and design. Most of my gripes are buggy graphics and such that have more to do with the Switch's shortcomings as opposed to the games'. And even gripes that are the game's fault are done purposefully to make the game better. If you play this game you will certainly not be disappointed.That was the short version, long version of why this game is awesome along with a plot synopsis will continue now.Synopsis: A century before the game begins, the peaceful kingdom of Hyrule was attacked by an evil entity known as Calamity Ganon, who is the game's version of the usual Zelda villain Ganondorf. Princess Zelda and her knight Link, fight the evil Ganon but lose, and Link barely escapes with his life. He's placed in a bed of water inside a cave for a hundred years and when he wakes up with no memory of what happens, he has to fight to defeat Calamity Ganon and his minions to purge Hyrule of its darkness.Okay so first the plot. I'm not too familiar with the canon storyline of Zelda, but from what I've heard the game's storyline is completely original, at least in its structure. I really like how it got the elements of Zelda's story and broke them up into little parts and built up in its own unique way.And surprisingly enough for such a simplistic children's story of good versus evil, it's very compelling. Link's memories become somewhat of a mystery and how he is in a world he has to defend but not remember becomes very interesting. Sure the whole ""You don't remember me but you should"" angle from almost every NPC becomes pretty flat, but I'll admit that its very compelling.What limits the stories RPG elements such as the bog standard story and robotic NPCs are pretty much forgotten. I mean, the game is just genius. The music is atmospheric and engaging, what should make the game boring and forgettable such as the conventions of video game RPGs and fantasy instead make the game more classic. The combat sticks to the average shift and strike sort of method but still remains very very fun. There were times when I was on the edge of my seat, just slamming the respawn button to get back at an enemy in the game who defeated me.Speaking of which, this game does not treat you like a baby. It doesn't hold your hand through a two hour tutorial, the handling of mechanics is very straightforward, and most of all the difficulty. On a scale between a Disney Channel online game and Dark Souls, Breath of the Wild is somewhere in the middle. It's easy enough that you can progress without being a hard core gamer, but hard enough to want you to keep getting stronger.Likewise, there's something here for everyone. Hard core RPG fans can enjoy the rich worldbuilding and character design. Fantasy nuts can really enjoy the brilliantly created setting. And people who like fighting games can enjoy the very fun combat angle which is a very refined system which is based both on the player's skill and items. Everyday people who aren't too into gaming and just want to escape for a little can enjoy how investing the gorgeous graphics of the game are.My gripes actually have reasons for them existing. I really don't like how weapons can break because its annoying to get a really cool or powerful weapon just for it to break two seconds later. However it prevents players from creating an overpowered build and flying through the game. I also don't like how the loading screen had awkwardly scratchy transitions and how riding at full gallop on a horse can make the bottom part of the screen sort of have an annoying 'ghost effect'. Again, this is the Switch's fault, not the game's.Another gripe I have is the reliance on more powerful weapons as opposed to skill. To defeat stronger bosses you just need better arrows, which can be bought with the game's currency rupees. But this is just pretty tedious, grinding away at weaker enemies and selling their drops to exchange them for arrows.Again this can be blamed on the simple fact that the game is an RPG, grinding is a simple facet of every role playing game. But it also limits the game heavily, you kill monsters to get drops, you sell drops to get rupees and spend rupees to buy arrows which defeat stronger enemies. You spend rupees on arrows pretty much. While limiting, I prefer this to simply having a purely skill based system which obligates newer players to just give up instead of grind when they reach an area of the game with too strong a boss.Another gripe is that there is no simplified progression system to track your progress. Sure there's a 'Quest Log' that tracks how many quests you completed but still, on the game as a whole there is no way to know how many items you've obtained, there's no EXP system to boost your stats and most of all, and out of all of the game's content, how much of it you've experienced. Really enjoyable games such as Chasm, Assassin's Creed and even Lego Star Wars had clearly defined systems that let you know how much of the game there was left to uncover.But like my other gripes I understand this entirely. In order to let the player create his own adventure instead of having a streamlined system tell him how much is left to uncover, he or she has to do it on his own, a surprisingly smart system for forcing the player to tackle the game on his or her own terms. Like Skyrim, the player does not have to follow the main story to progress through the game. He or she can take on side quests, dungeons and simply explore the game's magnigicent setting. This, like the removal of the average 'game percentage' aspect really allows the player to have the best experience possible.The game gives an engaging experience on every level imaginable, from the simplest design to the most complex. The original game 'The Legend of Zelda' followed Link on his journey to reunite the pieces of the tri force, but this game focuses on Link's journey to defeat Ganon to free Hyrule from his grasp. The game does not retcon the whole series, but instead uses its elements in a new and intelligent way. It uses canon elements like building blocks to create its own beautiful masterpiece of a story and game. Unlike most RPGs, there is no leveling system, but instead...shrines which have replaced dungeons. Each shrine includes various obstacles, puzzles and enemies, at the end of which is a statue that gives you a Spirit Orb and a full health regeneration.Every four Spirit Orbs lets you become stronger, either giving you an extra heart, or more stamina, which you use to run, glide and climb. There are over a hundred unique shrines with their own design and that in itself is genius and scrupulous game design. Can you imagine that? More than a hundred specially designed rooms, each with their own loot and obstacles. This really is a masterfully crafted game, with tons of effort and creativity thrown in. Little bits of fun here and there such as little 'Children of the Forest' or spirits, which have the most unique and interesting design, occur almost nine hundred times. How amazing is that? Nine *hundred* seperate encounters with unique spirits, each that give you seeds to max out your inventory. That is just one of the many aspects of the game that make it the most engaging and well designed video game ever made. The sheer amount of effort and ingenuity put into this game really shows, from the plethora of uniquely designed characters and monsters, items, dungeons (shrines), bosses, and puzzles.I've never wanted to play a game that I hoped never ended except for this one. And when I finish it, I will probably play it again and again. And if you try it, you probably will too.";10/10;31 December 2018;26 out of 31 found this helpful.

145;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;Legend of Zelda Breath of Fresh Air;I have spent my whole life playing the Legend of Zelda series loving each entry of the series, however over time I have noticed that the series has become far too formulaic and after Skyward Sword hand holding was taken way too far. Which is why I am glad to say that Breath of the Wild has taken every bit of the formula that was monotonous and threw it completely out of the window.For the first time since the first entry way back in 1986 you have complete freedom of how you want to approach the game. From the very first moments you see the world unfold around you it won't be long until you get to explore the large and vast world of Hyrule.After you complete the very brief tutorial of the game you can go wherever you want and do whatever it is you want to do. Feel like going straight to Hyrule castle to fight Ganon? Go ahead but don't be surprised if your ass gets completely handed to you.One thing to note in Breath of the Wild is that the difficulty of the game when it comes to combat has become increasingly harder and you must learn to adapt to new ways of handling these encounters as you play. There were many times I would be killed again and again forcing me to keep loading back into the same confrontation which forced me to change my approach.With all my praises of this game the one complaint I habe is the story itself which given the scope and scale of the game I expected to be much more. I soon realized the true story of the game is your adventure and when I came to think of that I didn't mind so much that the story wasn't stronger as my adventure and my journey throughout the game was so fun and compelling that there were times where I didn't even notice the story so much.I really hope to see where Nintendo can take the franchise from here and with their new approach to the Zelda formula I hope to see many Zelda games with this level of freedom in the future. A definite must own for Zelda fans and even those who are curious or new to the series.;10/10;1 September 2018;19 out of 23 found this helpful.
146;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;Zelda just keeps getting better and better installment by installment.;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an amazing game that will surely be seen as a go-to definition of open-world gaming comparable to Grand Theft Auto or Super Mario 64. and even a little Skyrim-esque in parts. Breath of the Wild feels like a Zelda game, but also feels like an adaptation of the games by Hayao Miyazaki's team at Studio Ghibli. This game is unimaginably gorgeous to look at and play. Its scope is nearly quadruple that of Ocarina of Time (and I freaking LOVE Ocarina of Time), and it's such an enormous game that I wonder if I'd dare to say that it's even BIGGER than G.T.A. V. Also it's the launch title that made the Nintendo Switch SOAR to the top of the charts!Get this game if you're a human being with a pulse and who has a strong love for all things video-games.

148;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;One of the best games I've ever played!;A huge problem with previous Zelda games is the limited freedom. Nintendo completely changed that with Breath of the Wild.As soon as you walk into the endless world of BOTW, EVERYWHERE you see you can visit, heck if you want to, you can run in and defeat Ganon without anything! It truly is a change to the Zelda series. The story-line is great and the cut-scenes with voice acting make it seem that much more interesting. Plus, with the Switch, you can play a major console game on the GO! (Beat that Horizon Zero Dawn and any other Switchless console/PC game.)Another great thing about BOTW is all of the side quests, shrines, korok seeds, DLC and MORE! So when you finish the main quest you haven't finished the game. There are still places you can visit and hundreds of things you can do among all of the side quests, DLC, etc.No game is perfect, it does have some flaws such as the occasional drop of frame rate however it has improved and doesn't disrupt the experience.Overall, it's an excellent game for young to old, zero Zelda experience to an Ultra Zelda Fanboy and non-gamer to hardcore gamer.;10/10;19 August 2017;12 out of 15 found this helpful.

150;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;This game makes you feel guilty for spending so much time indoors;This game places you in the middle of a massive land so detailed and beautiful that it truly depresses you that it's not real. There are areas where the temperature goes down or up and you have to deal with it. It rains and that affects things like climbing (speaking of climbing, you can climb almost every surface in the game). You have stamina which makes you have to think about how you will get from point a to point b. The game makes you think the way you would if you were truly in the wild.On other notes, the story's great, the npcs and all fun, the combat is excellent, and the shrines are a real treat. But the best part about this game is the freedom you feel of simply being in the great outdoors where you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want.;10/10;27 September 2021;4 out of 4 found this helpful.

153;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;I don't know how I feel about this game;While most of the Zelda games have had quite a bit of world-building and exploration, they took this to a whole new level here. The world and exploration is more vast. I hope Nintendo continues with the open-world idea. I was eager to explore more of the world with this game. The world is immersive and you can cook your own food, run into people, encounter shrines, build your own house and town, and other challenges...there is a lot of things you can do in this game.I guess I'm in the minority here, I don't understand why people dislike the Divine Beasts dungeons, I thought it was a neat concept to have you control the divine beasts while also figuring out the puzzles in the dungeon. But I think it's because I'm a sucker for puzzles. Too bad you can't go near them after you defeated the bosses. I mean, what if there's a chest in there that you may have forgot? I love most of the champions and how they give you powers after you complete each Divine Beasts.Gameplay aside, the story was so-so and again too dramatic. The story was nearly non-existent, there is like no established story except for you have to defeat the Divine Beasts, find all the memories, and defeat Calamity Ganon. I didn't like the idea of Link waking up from a hundred-year sleep with amnesia and some of the characters such as Zelda, Impa, and Revali were annoying characters to me. Zelda is an overemotional brat who pressures herself, takes her stress out on Link and cries too much. Some people do complain about how stoic Link is in this game and it makes me wonder why Nintendo downgraded Link's expressions in this game after the last few 3D Zelda games had a more expressive Link in my opinion.Some things didn't make sense such as the Master Sword killing you. The ending didn't make sense and it didn't seem to wrap everything up. It just ends with Zelda and Link looking up at the sky and how did Zelda survive a hundred years and hold in Ganon for this long? Wouldn't that be tiring for her?I don't know if I should recommend this game or not, it's okay but the story seems pretty short and non-established. I do feel it's overrated. Also, Zelda and her relationship with Link was off-putting. I don't ship Zelink and not in a million years do I want them together.;6/10;13 March 2018;11 out of 35 found this helpful.

At 36 years old i fell in love with Zelda and i cannot wait for BOTW 2.;10/10;5 September 2019;10 out of 13 found this helpful.
157;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;Impressive to a First Timer;Though I didn't really grow up playing Zelda on the NES or SNES I've come to fall in love with the series over the last couple of years, from the music to seeing some of the games, I thought what a better time to finally make the plunge and play the game than with the hotly anticipated BOTW for Nintendo Switch and Wii U. I chose the Wii U version.Of course the story is pretty simple, Gannon is evil, now stop him and how you do that is largely up to you. The routes you take, the quests you do, the story you watch take shape through your actions or lack of actions. I've never been a big puzzle game person and BOTW will offer some puzzles ranging from tutorial to head scratching that requires some deep thought on the best way to solve. Many of these puzzles do have multiple ways to solve it.The vast open world wastes no time getting down to business with nothing more than a pair of shorts you are thrusted and expected to figure things out. Thankfully the game is very intuitive it's not hard to pick up on what needs doing and how to do it, quickly, especially in combat. As the game progresses you continue to explore the large and vast world of Hyrule and figure more challenges and obstacles, much through trial and error.Traveling is time consuming, you will spend a great deal of time moving from place to place. There is always something to see and do, finding a shrine to solve a puzzle or uncovering more of the map by climbing large towers. Doing the shrines is optional but will benefit you in the long run by allowing you to increase health and stamina to better handle the obstacles.Combat while intuitive is more often a hassle than a reward. Weapons are puzzling fragile and break after so many uses. While weapons and shields plentiful, you're still limited by what you can carry, unless you want to embark on quests to expand your inventory by finding tiny little needles in the large haystack of the world. Breaking weapons is all to common as even with the best weapons you're still only doing chip damage on tough enemies and bosses.Cheap one-shot-kills also seem oddly common, even when equipped with armor getting a single arrow in your side or a lucky swipe from an enemy you'll be dead before you hit the ground. The game can still be forgiving in this sense, when you are knocked on your knees you'll have a decent moment to get back up to defend yourself before more damage can be done. Save scumming can help prevent excessive setbacks and the auto-save system works as well as it needs.I can't speak for the Switch but the Wii U version suffers lag and even momentary lockups at times. I know this game has been in development for a long time and I know game consoles like the Switch aren't made overnight so no doubt R&D and development had to have been working on since the early days of the game's production but the fact the issues are happening when the Wii U has been on the market for several years, this is a first-party-in-house development by Nintendo just screams amateur hour.BOTW is a visually impressive and fun game with a few minor irritants. The frustration though does lead to more and more desire to continue and push on instead of surrendering and that is the mark of a great game.;9/10;14 March 2017;14 out of 20 found this helpful.
158;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;My favorite of the 3D Zelda games, perhaps my fave period;I enjoyed the 3D games such as Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess. however, I also found them to contain flaws. Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess I found the dungeons over huge, Majora's Mask I felt was too repetitive and then Windwaker I found to have a very bland over world as it just took forever to sail to places. Skyward Sword I could not even get through because there was a really good game in there, but it was plagued by the WII's shoddy controls. This one though was just great, not perfect, but closer than any of the other 3D perspective games I have played. My other super favorite Zelda game is the one for the Super Nintendo, Link to the Past. This Zelda game is more about exploring and I enjoy doing that a lot. There are dungeons, but they are navigated easily and it doesn't take all that long to get through them and I did not need a guide to navigate them! A real treat and a great entry to the series.The story has Link awakening from a slumber with no memories. He gets a device called a Shieka Slate that helps him navigate the world and he sets out on his quest to stop Ganon who is at it once again! Link must find shrines to increase his power, he must free the guardians to gain powers and help aid in his quest to defeat Ganon and he must help the lands become free of terror that is Ganon!The game play is mainly exploring as you get to got where you want after you get through the first plateau and get the glider. Granted, it becomes easier getting places the more stamina you build up as this Link has amazing climbing abilities! It is fun just searching for towns, stables to spend the night and checking the map and seeing if anything looks interesting to explore. You can find this little guys called Koraks that give you seeds that help expand your inventory and you can find shrines to help you can heart containers and more stamina plus there are fairy fountains to help increase the strength of your inventory. Weapons break in this one and at times that was a bit annoying, but not as bad once you get the master sword. I also wish Nintendo had a trophy system because it would have added more motivation to complete quests, as you do not get all that much for completing most quests, usually just rupees which are kind of plentiful in this one.So, definitely my favorite of the 3D perspective Zelda games and perhaps my fave period. I loved the exploring aspect of the game, though I did not really take advantage of the horse riding in this one. I was afraid I would miss too much riding the horses. It is fun finding new places in this one, as I said I would open the map and try to figure out an interesting place to go during my quest. Where a shrine might be hidden or a Korak may be hiding. I liked freeing the guardians and gaining powers that would help me survive longer or explore more fully too. Just an incredible game, I like this format and hope they do a variation of it for another Zelda, but perhaps add a few more typical dungeons to change it up.;10/10;12 March 2019;10 out of 14 found this helpful.
159;Nintendo;The Legend of Zelda;Obvious;I mean this game is a masterpiece, anyone who says otherwise has probably not even completed the great platue.Got a friend who tried the game once, then I asked how he liked it, and then he said it was boring. I asked him how far he was into the game, he said he didn't know. I asked him if he had gotten the paraglider and he didn't know what it was. And then I said he hadn't even completed the tutorial. Lmao.Then I got another friend that I let borrow my game to try it. A week passes and I ask, how did you like it? He responded I played for 10 minutes and then didn't want to play more because he said he didn't like the graphics. Bro what?;10/10;5 May 2023;3 out of 3 found this helpful.

162;Nintendo;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury;Only a Bowser's Fury Review;Based on what I've played from Bowser's Fury, if nintendo took this route with future 3d Mario games, I wouldn't mind. The music is very diverse and fits the theme of which segment of the game you're playing, the team-up with Bowser Jr. Is interesting for the Mario series, and the collectables feel like they serve a role to the story rather than being things to collect to enter the next level or 100 percent the game. Super Saiyan Mario is also hilarious and badass. This review is more vague because the game is still fairly new.;10/10;31 May 2021;6 out of 6 found this helpful.

164;Nintendo;Metroid Dread;Would likely rate a 9.5 but will round up for the obvious passion behind the product.;Amazing game start to finish. The exploration, the mechanics and boss fights. If there would be two critiques the first would be to improve the soundtrack, it was a common critique I had with Samus Returns, the remakes of previous metroid songs are excellent but new material lacks the same emotion as previous entries. But where they may dip a bit in sound they exceed in graphics and mechanics. Both Samus Returns and Dread feature stunning attention to detail in environments and bosses are mechanically brilliant both games featured some of my most memorable boss encounters. though my favorite franchise boss would still be quadraxis from Metroid Prime 2. I'd say give this game a try you will get frustrated at times but this is matched or exceeded by the feeling of victory when you master the encounter.;10/10;12 October 2021;6 out of 6 found this helpful.
165;Nintendo;Metroid Dread;One of my favorite games!;Metroid has always been my favorite video game franchise. I was happy when Metroid Prime 4 was announced, and was hoping for an update this past E3. I forgot to be disappointed when there was no new Prime news, because Dread was announced! I LOVED this game! I am not the best at games, but I have always loved the challenges the Metroid franchise provides. It pushes me to be better. Dread is a hard game, but with practice anyone can figure it out! I love the art design, and the story. The music was good for atmosphere, though forgettable. All in all this is one of my favorite games of all time! Worth the wait, and the price tag!I will see the story is at its best if you have at least played Super Metroid, and Metroid Fusion. Though you can probably just watch a quick story break down online prior. While the story recap at the beginning of the game was informative, it didn't capture the emotion of the story in my opinion.;10/10;14 October 2021;6 out of 6 found this helpful.
166;Nintendo;Metroid Dread;My favorite game of all time.;Dread has most fluid gameplay and fast paced gameplay of every game I've played. Puzzle elements are nice and simple, this game is linear without it being linear. There are no points of the game where I felt extremely lost. If there is one gripe I have with the game is that the E. M. M. I are very good at killing you. The E. M. M. I sections are a bit too frequent but not by much. I would recommend this game to anyone, just make sure that you don't have anxiety or scare easily.;10/10;29 October 2021;6 out of 6 found this helpful.
167;Nintendo;Metroid Dread;My 2021 Game of the Year!;The only adventure I've gone through with Samus was Super Metroid and I greatly enjoyed it. However I was immediately dethroned for me by Metroid Dread. The visuals are positively stunning, the bosses and enemies are a tough challenge, the secrets you can find in every corner are rewarding and give you a sense of accomplishment and power, the music is brilliantly done, the game is (for the average player) around 8-11 hours long which means when you master it you can breeze through it in a few hours. This narrowly claimed my game of the year (with Halo Infinite being nearly, nearly as good of a game) but honestly, it deserves it and I am patiently (not really though) awaiting for Metroid Prime 4... I'll just have to wait about six years, but it'll be fine!;10/10;19 February 2022;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
168;Nintendo;Metroid Dread;A Fantastic Return;After 19 long years, Metroid Dread has finally arrived, and it's everything fans of Samus Aran's 2D adventures could have wanted. Excellent controls, phenomenal visuals, and an interesting story combine to make a challenging, but rewarding package. 19 years was a long time to wait, but this title is good enough that it almost makes up for that.;10/10;13 October 2021;8 out of 10 found this helpful.
169;Nintendo;Metroid Dread;Good action game, okay Metroid game;"Metroid Dread is an extremely fun action adventure game, with fluid combat and snappy movement. Beams are fun to use with the 360-degree aiming. The slide move is a welcome addition that keeps the momentum going. The bosses are challenging but satisfying to beat. They require you to learn the pattern, and master the fight. But it is slightly disappointing as a Metroid game. Notably, the atmosphere is not very prevalent. I wasn't as immersed in the world, and the soundtrack was less memorable (though it did grow on me). Areas were more distinct and interesting looking than Samus Returns, with good variety, but I just wasn't immersed like the other games. The counter indicator and constant (loud) combat with smaller enemies took the focus away from exploring an alien world. I felt that there weren't as many moments with a moody, oppressive atmosphere that I just wanted to soak in. The game is also fairly linear, even though it takes you through many different areas. You go on a relatively straight path, with little option to do another area first (like in Super Metroid). This could've worked if the game had a more intricate story (like in Metroid Fusion), but there isn't much of one to be found. However, the planet is still extremely fun to explore, thanks to items being placed in every nook and cranny. With fun puzzles to solve to get them. The speed booster in particular had lots of satisfying item puzzles, that took advantage of the movement. The power-ups were all useful, and fun to use. It might be a nitpick, but the graphics look sort of plasticy, and the art style is less grimy and detailed than say, the Metroid Prime games (which were also 3D, on notably less powerful hardware). The backgrounds do look phenomenal, and there's plenty to see, but I felt like the character models could've looked a little bit better. I prefer Metroid to have disgusting, scary looking enemies, but I felt like there was a little bit of missed potential for that here (though that's definitely a nitpick). The EMMI sections were satisfying, and intense. The fights with the robots were especially engaging (partially because of the dynamic camera angle). However, they certainly didn't build much dread, and didn't have as oppressive of an atmosphere as I would've liked. They stay the same throughout the whole game, with little variation to keep you on your toes (to be fair, each one uses a different power-up). They always stay within their zone (which all look the same), and they all have pretty much the same design (just with different colors). Compare this to the SA-X in Metroid Fusion, which showed up unexpectedly (on a first playthrough), in various environments, and you didn't know when it would appear next. I felt that there was a missed potential to really play into that ""dread"" the game is named after. What if one of the EMMI broke out of its zone unexpectedly, or were infused with the X and took on a more disturbing design? I just felt that there could've been more surprises with them. Though again, I have to admit they were fun, just not ""dread"" inducing. Bringing up the story again, I felt that it was less impactful then the two previous numbered entries. The cutscenes were very well choreographed, had lots of personality, and we're action packed. But there wasn't much of a narrative, even compared to Super Metroid (which was on the SNES). There were twists to be sure, but nothing was built up. Some new characters were introduced, but they barely interact with Samus, or offer much personality. Even the mandatory sections were Samus must talk to Adam, offer little in the way of character interaction, or expand on the world. The dialogue between Adam and Samus is missing the personality and charm that Fusion had, though to be fair, there is technically a reason for that (if you've beaten the game, you know what I mean). I also think 1-2 text based monologues (like Fusion), would've been decent here, since Samus is seeing the race that raised her, unexpected alive and well. I would've liked to hear a tiny bit of her thoughts. Though definitely not like in Other M. But overall, nitpicks aside, this is still a great game, and I'm glad Metroid is back. It was extremely satisfying to play. I just hope the next entry, will be slightly more atmospheric, than this one.";8/10;5 March 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
170;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;Great game if you can keep your cool.;"So, World of Warcraft... is it a great game you can spend days, weeks, months and even years on? The answer lies somewhere in between. I've had some really really great times playing wow and I've had some really really boring moments. The secret to loving WoW is to keep it somewhat at bay, do not let it ruin your life. I admit there were some weeks and even months where I did nothing but play WoW. And because of that I got so sick of it I hated myself when I was playing. WoW is highly addictive and it can consume you. I have friends who have done nothing but play WoW for over a year. 10+ hours of gaming every day of the week. I know for a fact that for lots and lots of people this is what they do. You always want that next thing which is slightly better than the one you've already got. You want to see your character looking all hot and being able to churn out lots of damage or keep the members in your party alive so you can prevail and yell ""Victory!"".I've had many great times and met a lot of great people during my time in Azeroth and Kalimdor. I started out as Horde and it'll always be dear to me to see trolls, taurens, undead and fellow orcs. But this game takes its toll. You have to decide on how much time you want to spend on it. Level 1 to 60 is great for casual gamers who play some hours a day a few days of the week. And then when you hit level 60 you can just chill out and do the 5-10 man instances for the best and nicest blue gear possible from them, and have a hell of a good time doing it with good friends. But after you've done all that you have three choices. Option 1: Continue with that character and get him/her in a raiding guild to do some ZG/MC/BWL/AQ/Naxx and outdoor bosses. But this is not for everyone. Here you have to spend about 5 hours on each raid night and often several days of the week. And few people will not see the valid logical reasons for this. There must be a better way to spend your real life time on. Option 2: You continue playing but on another character. Either you want to try out the opposite faction or just another class so you can experience the game from a different point of view. Downside here is that the game won't feel as fresh as before and leveling can become a bit boring as you've done most of the quest before. Option 3: Simple. You logout and cancel your subscription and you quit playing WoW. Here you say to yourself, it was a great game and fun while it lasted. But it's time to move on.World of Warcraft is a great game if you can manage to control your game time. You meet great people and it's fun to see your character getting stronger and wiser. But after a while (after level 60 sometime) you find yourself at a crossroad. It's up to you which road you want to follow.";9/10;18 August 2006;52 out of 64 found this helpful.
171;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;Redefining video game addiction;Blizzard has always delivered a quality, well-thought-out product. World of Warcraft is certainly no exception. When this game was announced, it already had many fans (prospective players): those who played the original Warcraft games (of which there were three).This game now has 50.6% of the entire MMORPG market (according to http://www.mmogchart.com/) at the time of this writing. Blizzard is doing something that most other MMO creators have yet to do consistently: stay on top of the problems. Yes, it has some things that need to be fixed, but far less that any other MMO I've played.The world in which this game is set is absolutely stunning and brilliant in complexity as well as it's immersive nature. Players choose sites between either the Horde or Alliance, then select a race followed by a class (i.e.: a warrior, a mage, etc). The Warcraft series has already developed a full, rich lore on which the World of Warcraft can draw it's own story line.I know that Wikipedia isn't always overly accurate, but I must say, if you're curious about this game, I'd say read the Wikipedia article.;9/10;7 June 2006;20 out of 28 found this helpful.

174;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;The most AMAZING Online Computer Game ever Created;Only Two words sum up World Of Warcraft, Sheer Brilliance. This is unlike any game you will ever play. You will be hooked as soon as you start to play as this game is SO darn addictive !! World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online game that enables thousands of players to come together online and battle against the world and each other. Players from across the globe can leave the real world behind and undertake grand quests and heroic exploits in a land of fantastic adventure. At long last, the world of Azeroth, first glimpsed in Warcraft 1 and further enhanced in subsequent strategy games, is realised in glorious detail and ready for the arrival of millions of prospective players. World of warcraft is 20 times better than all current MMORPG's, simply because it is 20 times more FUN.There are a few reasons why WOW is ten times MORE FUN than other MMORPG's. Attack cities and kill its leader with 39 other people. Lots of PvP, Lots of fun. Warsong gulch is like capture the flag in Quake except its an RPG game instead of a First Person Shooter. Endless hours of fun there. The Battlegound Alterac valley. 40 vs 40 PvP-zone that is huge and even has PvP-quests in it. Hours of FUN. A huge pvp arena where fighting is too the death. A chest is dropped in an arena every 3 hours and opening it is interesting as pvp is free for all in there and everyone wants to open it and will do everything they can to stop you. MORE FUN. Instance Dungeons for level 60's like Stratholme, Scholomance, Black rock depths, Lower blackrock spire, upper blackrock spire. Dire maul north, dire maul west, dire maul east, Molten Core, Blackwing lair and so on and so on. Plus all the high level elite bosses roaming around the world that takes 30-40 people some effort to take down. More instances and brand new content added EVERY month in new patches (this is the reason why we pay our monthly fee, and we are well rewarded). A talent system that enables you to define you character from everyone else and also an Ability to redo your talents whenever you want which lets me do what I want when I want and the way I like it. OK this game does have it's downside's. Don't all games? The main problem with this game is the company that created it. Servers go offline with no warning, some servers can have bad lag at peak times, and most of the servers are full with queue times when you first log in. The customer service from Blizzard Entertainment is Auful, but it is getting better as time goes on. Also, a lot of younger players play this game and some more mature people will find this difficult, as playing with 12 year old children that spam the chat channels is not their idea of an Online game. If this does not appeal to you, play Everquest 2 instead. As a final word, World of Warcraft is the best Computer game available for the PC to date, and seeing its huge amount off success across the world, will be for a long time.;10/10;1 October 2005;40 out of 63 found this helpful.

I also like looking for all of the homage to things in the real world. If you look at the trivia section in IMDb and have a look, some of them are really obvious but you don't see them.Best game i have ever played. But the game takes over your life.

It's a whole new world and with patches constantly updating and expanding the world it takes place in, there is no end to the future it has in front of it. There is no game ever made that can even come close.

177;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;Classic Was Great Then, Very Good Now;Excitement, adventure, and amazement unfolded when the game first came out, like opening the gates of a wonderland. Focused on polished game play and community, World of Warcraft learned much from its declining predecessors and impressively has this original version in tact. Role play servers were for role-players and was a norm both in random interaction as well as guilds.Customer service is a definite highlight, changes are positive as they are in response to player's interests/requests. Finding quests can be a bit of a challenge at times and in the series, this version is the most difficult to survive questing especially solo.Although Classic is still around today, the wave of nostalgia players have come and gone (now that Burning Crusade Classic is the rage). This means there's not really much of a community anymore as well as little to buy/sell at the auction house. Few role players can be found on the role play server. On the upside, there's no competition for questing, nuisance chat or spam, so the world feels big again. Difficulty is up, finding groups, earning gold, and a good-fit guild is down.;10/10;18 July 2021;2 out of 2 found this helpful.

And some afflict to some and maybe not to others. World of Warcraft is like any online game if anyone plays it too much. After spding months playing the game, the gamer will start to get more ruthless and addicting to it, straying away from his real life and making the game replace it. The gamer will start swearing as regular talk, rebelling against parents or superiors, and become very dull and ungreateful in life. These are the things that make a game addict, so be careful when playing World of Warcraft, do not get too addicted to it, and also keep in mind the things that matter more in life. But don't get me wrong, it is a great game, and I recommend it only to mature gamers, those who know to control their lives.Total Mark: 8/10By HowlingRabbit334;10/10;19 June 2009;5 out of 9 found this helpful.
180;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;Great Game, but too consuming;World of Warcraft or WOW whatever you want to call it is A great game. Its fun, you meet with lots of other gamers, you feel a sense of accomplishment completing quests, and leveling up. While this game is that great it has the ability to consume people. This can take drastic effects on your life, and if you find yourself playing for more then 3 hours a day then you need to get help.I played the game myself spent sunny summer days inside playing WOW doing instances that took 4-5 hours when I could have been outside swimming, hanging out with friends. Then I gave the game up for 2 years. I returned to the game got to level 40 but hung it up again after that. People have to realize there are other good things out there besides this Love, Friendship.And if your in School playing this its simple find something else to do to kill time and make you forget it or if your out of school working go to the gym hang out with friends, my case I was in high school so I played on my high school football team to kill time and make me forget it. With all that going on I only had about 2 hours a night to play. I have seen friends get divorced because they got consumed don't let it happen.The game is fun and OK and a lot of fun to play, when it gets to the point where it consumes you, you have to know when to stop before it gets dangerous. If you don't want it to consume you then best advice is to stay away from it.;7/10;19 January 2009;4 out of 8 found this helpful.
181;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;Total Immersion Virtual Reality;Sit back and let the screen dissolve the walls from your peripheral. Your vision will brighten to levels you've never experienced before. You have entered Blizzard's latest creation, real_life_+_2! You'll be so amazed by the sheer stupidity that engulfs you that you'll soon forget the everyday imbeciles knocking at your door and gladly spend any time you have and a bit more, engaging in mind-numbing activities.This virtual collective follows cycles much like those in the three-D. Press your puffy eyes to the screen and the similarities will become clear. Turning on, you already took the necessary first step and abandoned any hope of completing the critical task you scheduled for today. What? You say it wasn't on purpose, you meant to, but you just couldn't move? Now you're getting it. Here's a delicious nutritious binary-encoded reward to promote and strengthen insalubrious root growth. Open up young sedent, quaff some more.Begin your day as you would any other. the early bird catches the worm. In this case you'll find the far-eastern red-bellied gold gobbler already hard at work. I see you've jumped ahead and introduced yourself to this rare specimen. This action is unadvised, the brief friendship you might strike up will be one you might share with an intestinal parasite. Besides, even if this wasn't a migrant fleeing exploitation in an economic underclass far-far-away and he could understand you, his beak would still be too full of precious metals to answer. In this burden-less collective that accepts button mapping and a few levels of situational logic as hard work, it's best to observe this wonderous beast from afar and voice your disapproval for the support of casuals.Now, if you cup your ear and lean into the wind, you might hear faint moans of dejection wafting over the hills. They're not cries for help, rather they belong to the social reject that even in a game filled with ambition-less impulse-driven machines finds himself banished to a far off land, picking mushrooms for an imaginary tea party. Not to be confused with the frenzied pitter-patter of obsessive compulsives hastening to treat every last quest as an order and leave no stone unturned. they're altogether quieter in their eagerness and as a result much less burdensome.All that time wasted already. While you were busy ogling, the day moved into its busiest stage. Watch for the first indicator, society dropping off their mollycoddled mental degenerates at the cyber crèche. Now you'll be able to listen to them gibber incessantly for attention. If you're really lucky the seaside cutouts might treat you to a rippling montage of lingering homo-erotic poses. Flexing their inworldly spoils at an audience too pavlovian to invoke the illiterate jeers you'd expect them to fear from years of playground abuse.The roaring river becomes a deluge as the bitter workforce returns to the nest with unwanted retellings of humorous stories they were told over an icy water cone. Having deftly lane-hopped their way out of gridlock to squeeze a few more hours out of the day, it's time for them to sit back in the comfort of their own home and enjoy a reenactment of the rush hour traffic they just escaped. Recreated electronically with an exaggerated cast of inconsiderate pedestrians and suicidal cyclists. At this point frustration drives every killing zone into ugly competition and every city becomes a swarming mass of pixels, slowing everything to a slow chug. Tardiness is next to ungodliness and should you fall into this group and fail to escape from the roads of mayhem, collect your punishment, more queueing.Gradually bedtimes calm the world and sweet quiet drifts across the lands. The inebriated -- those you'd expect to find under a bridge wrestling over a half empty bottle of windowlene -- have managed to claw their way online. Students, mentalists, compensation settlers and the unemployed play out their staggered cycles here, tipping the scales precariously against sleep's favour. Eventually, after hours of scouring the lands forbidden during daylight, they'll pass out and eager chirping will fill the air once again.Now, what are you doing tomorrow?.. I can hazard a guess.;6/10;15 September 2006;7 out of 30 found this helpful.

183;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;Perfect Sequel;With already solid footing, World of Warcraft put this fantastic capstone atop its remarkable successful game. The Burning crusade largely expanded the world in every direction including, questing, exploring, community, battlegrounds, dungeons and raids. Additionally were two more races with interesting backstories, as well as an overall developing story that most players could follow.Community when this first came out was the highlight, as players were experienced from the previous but exposed to a lot of new content which drove them to be helpful as well as curious. Role play blossomed on role play servers including guilds.Flying was a massive addition, there always seemed something new to do or people willing to join/help. Right now, Burning Crusade Classic is hot, so there's an influx of players, most of whom are just rushing through the ranks. Community is a fragmented, there's not a lot of helpfulness or role playing going on anymore even on role play servers.Long ago I'd waited for the midnight release of the game, took off work the next day, and was not disappointed. Still today, the dungeons and equipment are amoung the best looking in the game.;10/10;18 July 2021;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
184;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;A breath of fresh air!;Compared to the previous WoW expansions I believe that Cataclysm is the best yet. This is mainly because whilst changing a huge number of features in the game, such as the general landscape, level flow and race and class combo's it brings back a many things one hasn't seen since the Vanilla days (before any expansions) I.e. harder dungeons, which require crowd control, a refreshed conflict between the horde and alliance, and a more universal feel to the game. The graphics have also been greatly improved with a new water effect, and on top of that, the texture levels in the game and much better than before on items and in the landscape. The two new races added in the expansion (Goblin and Worgen) give a larger sense of diversity in an ever growing community. Both are very fun to play and have very exciting and imaginative starting zones which use the art of phasing very well. However I did enjoy the Worgen experience a little more than the Goblin. Blizzard have out done themselves again but even more so than any previous expansion. Whilst having an 'old school' feel to it which reminds players of the vanilla days, World of Warcraft Cataclysm brings a huge number of new elements to Azeroth which are most welcome and which definitely hot things up. Overall a very solid effort, which is almost perfect. I can only hope that each expansion Blizzard release for WoW will be as good as this one. *********;9/10;4 January 2011;3 out of 11 found this helpful.
185;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;The best extension;I started playing WotLK back when WoW was released. This is by far the best expansion for World of Warcraft.Here are some points that I liked very much.The PvP is very balancedEach class is very strong and has few disadvantages.The raids are absolutely great and also fun. Even if you do them every week again.My leveling experience was as follows: After I had created a human warrior I started in the Elvyn forest. Unlike previous expansions like The Burning Crusade or even vanilla WoW, the level speed is significantly higher. In just 3 days of 6 hours of gameplay each, I've also already entered Outland (TBC content). Then quickly through Outland and finally to the continent of Northrend. What I particularly liked about it were the varied level areas. From icy landscapes to green forests, everything is represented there. So if you feel like reliving this experience, you can start at the new WoW WotLK Classic servers. The first ones will be released on August 30, 2022.;10/10;27 August 2022;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
186;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;Fairly decent but please be careful;To be honest i was shocked when i saw this was coming out. Very excited got the collectors edition as i will with pandaria too and i downloaded it and at first i thought it was dazzling. The raids they new places and everything. But then when ds came out i really was somewhat disappointed. It was a raid that had no strategy except spine. Madness was easiest fight but on to my biggest concern which is pvp. The game has changed this season. Arena teams are more crafty and sometimes play like poons. When your a ranged this can be difficult for you because melee such as rogues will play this way. It could be the other way around too but beware you could rage significantly when losing to a class like a rogue so use caution. Overall though, this is a decent expansion but is my least favorite. Im hoping pandaria will make up for it;6/10;12 July 2012;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
187;Blizzard Entertainment;World of Warcraft;"A Good Expansion with a few ""hmmmm"" moments.";"So, to begin with, I really like this expansion. Whilst it is, essentially, more of the same, there are enough added features (that I like) to make it worth the money.At launch, there were some issues with the expansion and people getting stuck, but really, this is par for the course these days for nearly every game launch, so it wasn't much of an issue for me.So I've been playing for over a month now, and have levelled one character all the way to 100 and done the anniversary raid. Additionally, I've run five alts through the Draenor starting area. I see that part of the game in my sleep, I've done it so much.So what do I like about the expansion? Firstly, Blizzard have listened (sort of...) to the cries for some sort of player housing and given us garrisons. A place to build up and expand that is unique to your character. Of course, with each character having their own garrison, it quickly becomes very samey, and very time-consuming, but at least it gives you something to work towards. You attract followers through your character levelling progression that join your garrison and go on missions for you, often rewarding you with items, money or even experience for your character. Levelling up these followers is a game in itself, much like the previous pet battles system, though less hands-on than that mini-game.Garrisons are quite good fun and you can build each one up just as you prefer, allowing you to try different combinations of buildings to see what works best for each character. If you put in a building that proves to be not as helpful as you imagined, then you can simply replace it with another.From logging in, it takes about ten minutes or so to run your character around your garrison doing your daily chores (mining, herb gathering etc.) starting work orders in the buildings you have, gathering resources and then assigning your followers to do missions. Which doesn't sound like it is particularly tedious, but if you have several alts, each with their own garrison... you can see the time starts to mount up! It would be nice to see some sort of mobile app for this portion of the game, or at least perhaps an in-game ""Steward"" that will automate some of this for you, because it does become a little tedious at times.There is also now a new pet/mount/toybox window that shows you all that you have and all that you don't have! It is a nice little account-level organisational touch that means you no longer have to have items in your inventory and they are accessible by all your toons.In similar vein, there is now a new bank tab for reagants and crafting mats. Again, you no longer have to keep all the tools of your trade on your character. Mats can be used straight from the bank tab no matter where you are.So, what didn't I like? Okay, so in giving us some nice things there are inevitably going to be casualties elsewhere.Guilds have been nerfed. They no longer have levels or generate additional guild income. Also gone is the rep bonus and a few other things. Blizzard say they have rebalanced the game to take account of all this, but I'm not sure. It was kind of nice working towards levelling your guild up and getting bonuses. Now, everyone gets the same bonuses and rewards, barring the ones that required guild activities to obtain, which remain the same.Money, in this expansion, seems ridiculously easy to get. In levelling the one character to lvl 100 from 90, I vendored all the usual trash drops and greens (I couldn't be bothered to either disenchant or sell them on the AH) and I made in excess of 10k gold. Once the garrison is up and running, you can expect your followers to net you two or three hundred per day easily from missions. The average vendor price for items gathered from quests and drops seems to be between 10-50 gold per item and even junk sells for 1-10 gold.In short, money so far hasn't been a problem for me.The power level has been nerfed somewhat, but mostly just in terms of the numbers. You won't see items with +700 stamina anymore, but +200 or so is still quite common. Play-wise, the change makes little difference. Mobs have been nerfed too, so you still fight them at about the same level of difficulty.Another thing that has changed is the quest helper mechanics. Beforehand, you picked up quests without reading the text, followed the map to the area and then looked for the highlighted mobs to kill. I didn't think they could make this any easier, but somehow they have! In addition to the above, specific areas of the highlighted mape area are themselves highlighted, indicating particular goals of each quest. When you loot a mob, the quest items are highlingted. In essence, you no longer need to have any idea what the quest is about in order to complete it successfully, which is a bit of a shame really.FINAL EDIT: So, it all kind of went sour when Blizz failed to support the expansion properly. A zone that was supposed to be in from the start only appeared in patch 6.2. Endless sodding Apexis Crystal grinds. The flying debacle. Selfie patches! PvP horribly broken. Lack of content. Cats and dogs, living together...This expansion now looks like what it is... a filler between MoP and Legion, put out at full price, but with sub-par quantity, and quality, of content. 45% of the subscriber base gone within six months of launch.Apparently, it is not just the players that get a ""need/greed"" loot roll. The developers do, too! And they chose greed.";5/10;20 December 2014;7 out of 10 found this helpful.
188;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo III;Addicting And Satisfying.;Friday night, bored out of my mind. I start playing Diablo III on Adventure Mode and an hour later, it's Sunday morning.

189;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo III;It takes some of the nice elements from the old one but misses a lot.;When this game first game out, there was an auction house implemented early into its release. This auction house was used so players could sell other in game items to other players. This auction house was necessary at the time due to optimal items for your character being nearly impossible to find on your own. Blizzard realized this was a bad choice and decided to both remove the auction house and add an expansion pack known as Reaper of Souls.The expansion allowed you to get many more tailored item drops to your character. The item drops in the expansion were so improved that it makes most of your old items from vanilla Diablo III basically useless. The expansion is more fair to play through if you do own it. You actually don't feel as hopeless when you're finding items from monsters. The items you'll find a lot of times are actually good, tailored to your specific character.Well that's some good changes they made stated above. What I still dislike though is that you can't trade unique items to people unless you found that item in the same game session as that other person was in. Also, after 2 in game hours have passed, the item becomes account bound. If you want to duel your friends, you have to duel in a very small area. Unlike Diablo II where you are able to duel literally anywhere as long as it's not town, in Diablo III you're heavily restricted where you can duel your friends or others. Diablo II also had a much higher max player cap. In Diablo II, you could have up to 8 players in a game session. This allowed team duels in the Blood Moor for example. You could have 2v2v2v2, 4v4, 3v3v2, or even a straight out free for all, a 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. In Diablo III, game sessions are limited to 4 people only. This means you lose a lot of possible social interaction that you would have had if you were with more players at once.If you're looking at this game for mainly PvM or Person vs Monster action, it fills that role well. If you're looking for a true successor to Diablo II, I've heard many others suggest a game such as Path of Exile which is free as far as I know.I still do play Diablo III however. It lacks many elements that I wanted it to have but it still plays solid enough to play to pass the time. It's only worth playing at this point if you have the Reaper of Souls expansion pack though. It does get repetitive without a true duel system and that is a pretty big flaw to me. Diablo II's duel system is what kept people constantly farming up bigger and better items so that they would dominate on the battlefield against other players.Oh well, there's always hope for if or when Diablo IV ever comes out.I give this a 6/10. Playable but not ideal in my opinion.;8/10;20 May 2016;4 out of 8 found this helpful.

They made this part much easier, however you feel about that, the end-game content is still inaccessible to 95% of Diablo population.

195;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo III;An absolute disappointment and poor launch;"I bought diablo 3 at launch expecting it to be a good introduction to the diablo franchise. The first problem stems from the abysmal launch where it took me and many others hours just to log in because of some ""error 36/37"". At the time i didn't care because I was excited when i played the game and created my badass Demon Hunter and then I found another error, the lack of character customization, i think the demon hunter's have awesome male and female models but the other characters don't meet my appeal. I played upto level 20 on normal difficulty and enjoyed my experience upto that point, until i realized the game was, point, spam, done without any interesting equipment. I learnt only a few weeks ago that the devs made the equipment deliberately bland for normal to encourage people to play on inferno, however i was unaware of this at the time. Some other issues i have with the game include graphics and atmosphere, the game is surprisingly low ended graphics wise with the only exception being the cutscenes which are phenomenal, and i was lead to believe that diablo 3 would be an extremely grim and disturbing world, it was meh... One praise i have for diablo 3 is it's boss fights which i found incredibly entertaining and the dialog in towns and with the companions (specifically the templar) Here are a few bullet points to outline diablo 3 +Great cutscense +Great dialogue +Great boss fights -Horrific launch -below average graphics -repetitive nature -tame content (no mature focus) -boring lootIf i were to recommend a game similar in play style, Torchlight 1 or 2 (though i have briefly touched upon the games they are miles better than diablo 3)";4/10;19 January 2013;8 out of 32 found this helpful.

204;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch;So fun, but we'll never get this one back.;"Overwatch for me personally was one of the most fun games I had ever played of the decade. The years of its popularity, rise and prime were from around 2016-2020. After Jeff had left, things unfortunately went downhill quickly. However, the worst thing they ever did was to COMPLETELY get rid of Overwatch and instead completely make a new Overwatch from scratch and just place the number 2 beside it. I can never forgive the developers and department for doing that. Ever. All they did was come out with a campaign and special improvements. These aspects literally could have all been ADDED to the first Overwatch. What sucks even more is that people that love Overwatch or those that have always wanted to play Overwatch or have never heard, CAN NOT go back to play the first one ever. So basically in todays world now, it's an awkward conversation of someone asking ""Hey is Overwatch cool?"" Then there's a reply of ""Yeah! Overwatch 2 is cool!"" ""No. The first one is what I'm asking about."" ""Oh...there is no first one anymore. It's just Overwatch 2.""If Jeff had still been around, maybe none of this would have ever happened? I don't know, but the mere existence of Overwatch is just gone forever now. The only thing you can do now is reminisce and remember the good ole days you had with the first Overwatch. Hence why I'm writing now about how great it was, because it is the only thing I can do!I will say this. If you wanna play a game that has similarities to the first Overwatch, I highly recommend playing Paladins. It is way more fun than Overwatch 2!

205;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch;Overwatch Game Review;Pros: This game has a lot of characters, which means there are a lot of abilities for you to learn. Also, this game is not hard to understand. Cons: This game community is kind of bad, due to the fact that this game is an online game, so people don't care much about trash-talking, or being toxic. And the price of the game might not suitable for some people. Gameplay: This game easy to understand, basically it is a 6 versus 6 first-person shooting game. And the point of this game is to push the car (payload) to the point that they marked on the map, and the next thing is to capture the point on a map to win the game. Overview of the game: This game is an fps game, included with loot boxes that you can open for the skins inside the game. And this game has a lot of play modes such as arcade, competitive, deathmatch, capture the flag, etc. Moreover, if you are bored with the same kind of gameplay, you can join the finding game section that will let you create your own game mode that you can do any setting that you wanted by yourself. Furthermore, this game has competitive modes that allow you to play this mode to gain rank, and this is the most challenging mode that you can play in this game against other people. If you are in the higher rank, it is mean that you have a higher level of skill play than the lower rank player.;7/10;1 March 2021;2 out of 2 found this helpful.

214;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch;Ugh...;A great game plagued with an awful, toxic community and needless updates. This game could learn so much from the basicness of Team Fortress 2. All the different abilities do nothing to add to the complexity of the game as many think, they just make it confusing and embrace meta gameplay and shun those who wish to play differently.;6/10;3 August 2021;2 out of 3 found this helpful.

216;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch;A fun game without much content;Overwatch is an entertaining and captivating PvP game that has an interesting and diverse cast of characters in an intriguing world, but fails to actually incorporating any narratives into the game.Whilst it is very enjoyable to play, the game suffers from a lack of balance within the large cast of characters, a poor match-making system and an unfortunately toxic community both in and outside of the competitive scene.The worst aspects of Overwatch is what it lacks. There is no proper progression system where you are properly rewarded for playing the game - instead you play several matches at a time to level up and receive a lootbox, which may or may not reward you with anything that feels rewarding (most of the time it does not). Even with its competitive scene rewarding unique currency, it is a grind to obtain and can only be used to unlock the same golden variation of each character's weapons.The best aspect of Overwatch is, or perhaps it is better to say *was* it's frequent content drops, which included new cosmetics, maps, characters and events that kept the game fresh and enjoyable at least for a limited time. However, now the game has been barren of any real content for years and this only further highlights the flaws with the game.;5/10;23 May 2022;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
217;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;One Hell of A Journey;"It's done well, for the most part. The writing harkens back to Diablo's original two outings. a gothic, low fantasy miasma of hopelessness and intrigue. Most impressively, this version of Diablo's world feels, well, like a world again. a place with history and tension, rather than a collection of maps strung together to facilitate dungeon delving.Diablo 4 adopts a muted aesthetic and a slow-burn narrative that seems desperate to mimic Game of Thrones or Sony's God of War reboot, but it's constantly in tension with how massively unsubtle the series' worldbuilding has always been. ""It was probably demons,"" would have been an exceptionally useful dialogue choice to have for every person who asked me if I could investigate what happened to their loved ones. And, I'm sorry, I can't take it seriously when a sad quest where I end the life of a tortured man tied to a tree ends by giving me the spear I used as a temporary weapon upgrade.So far, nothing has convinced me the endgame is so brilliant that it's worth stripping everything out of the initial leveling process. The thin storytelling doesn't help either-thankfully you can skip it on subsequent characters. Diablo 4 is a live service game that puts an insulting amount of effort into trying to convince you it's not. It's backwards. trying to build up to the most robust part of itself instead of starting with it. The moment entering a fresh dungeon feels more like a chore than a ride is the moment Diablo loses me, and I've been worryingly close to that feeling in my time with it so far.Diablo IV went from a drudge completed only in service to my professional responsibilities to a pleasure I sought. There's something in Diablo IV that will appeal to you, if you know enough about yourself to find it. I don't know what that is yet, but in the coming weeks, I hope to find out and share it with you.";8/10;6 June 2023;6 out of 13 found this helpful.
218;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;Diablo IV is....;"I like this game. I played Diablo III for 6 years. I've been waiting for this game for a long time and recently finally got access to it.Advantages: +Graphics +Large amount of content +CharactersNeutral: +- Story +- Large mapI don't like: GameplayWhy did I write the story in ""neutral""? As I said, I played Diablo III for 6 years. I played through this game many times, where at the end Malthael broke the black soul stone, inside of which was Diablo's soul. (I played Reaper of souls) At the end they even say that Diablo is free. This is where the game ends. I thought that Diablo IV would have Diablo himself, but... he just isn't there. He is replaced by a certain Lilith, about whom I am hearing AT ALL for the first time. But I like the plot itself. That's why I wrote the story in ""Neutral"".So, what's next? Ah, ""Big Map"".... Question: ""What's wrong with this? This problem is related to the gameplay, which I don't like at all, and the gameplay is the main component of the game. So what's wrong? Lilith infuriates me. No, no, don't get me wrong, the GAMEPLAY with Lilith is terrible. The fact is that we are following in the footsteps of Lilith, but we NEVER MAKE TIME! NEVER! We constantly find bloody petals, and watch wonderful cartoons of Lilith killing someone. This is okay, but we are constantly going from one end of the map to the other. And at this time we are accompanied by small, but damn strong demons, and it becomes boring to beat small demons for the second hour without moving forward in the story. This is precisely the reason for which I abandoned the passage of Diablo IV.Result: 7/10.";7/10;2 March 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
219;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;Sold a beta (alpha even?) as full-priced AAA game;"According to D4 Armory website I got over 600h of playtime. Now that out of the way.It is no secret the original producers of the game have left the project some time ago, and despite multiple closed & open betas, early tests, etc. We got an undercooked game. At launch we received:GOOD: * Super fluid combat* Amazing graphics and sound effects. When you hit or cast a spell, the timing and sound just feel right* Good old Blizzard-level top notch cutscenesNEUTRAL: * Soundtrack was overly meh IMO, nothing stuck in my mind, except a single overly eerie WB fight music which is great. But it's a subjective topic, so...* Unlike most people, I'm kinda ok with the lack of trading of leggos & uniques. If done right, this could've been acceptable. I don't have a strong opinion for or against it, yet.* Abattoir of Zir is a nice touch, and kinda brings the Uber-Tristram/torch farming type of grind to endgameBAD:* Overly mediocre but unnecessarily complicated itemization* No resistances... in an ARPG... in 2023!* No ladder-system, again in a live-service ARPG... which relies on seasons!* The horse, oh the horse! Before they fixed it, the horse could drive any sane person crazy with its quirks and bugs and artificial limitations, like cooldown. the horse should have NEVER EVER left the devs' computers in this state to production, it was an abomination.* The end game loop was boring, and still is. Crafting is basically non-existant, ""grailing"" would be a joke. When they make Helltides, Legion Events, ToW stuff attractive, they make them redundant again with the next NMD XP buff or whatever.* Dependence on external websites & apps. yeah, we all want to track mystery helltide chests via a 3rd party site* A backwards step in social features, trading & LFGs via Discord, because in-game would be too comfortable* Boring endgame loop, and with every update they make either the Overworld redundant then fix it and then make it redundant again, in favor of NMDs or lately Uber-Bosses* Sidequests are only for masochistic completionists. You will do the ""same"" cellar prob 100 times. there were a lot of copy-paste there.* Inventory management, stash space, and character limitation. Oh come on, we don't need an infintite stash space as in some other games, or 50 char slots for mules, but 4 stash tabs? For a total of 10 chars? And all of it shared so no muling? What's the point of an ARPG whose core is *items* if you cant store them?* That major facepalm ""we load everybody else's stash into your memory when they're nearby"" tweet. it might have its reasons, but still unacceptable to any developer - and I mean any developer, not just game developers because it's basic data structure and memory management - to release it as it is. Imagine WoW, POE, any MMO or ARPG doing that.* and a ton of other missing usability features: codex & aspect management, missing search features, lootfilter in many places, random max limits on mats.This was mostly the launch state of the game and some problems still remain after 5+ months. I am 100% convinced that if the devs & testers had done more end-to-end leveling tests instead of point tests, they would have realized many, many, many problems and fixed them.The itemization & end-game loop are by far the biggest offenders, IMO in that order.The affixes are very similar to each other and redundant. the DiabLol video hit the nail on its head ""Damage on Thursdays"" meme. First crit & vuln were necessary, then they were supposedly not anymore... but guess what they are still necessary and most other affixes are just there, in a giant vague blur.And second, the white & blue items have absolutely zero use in the game, except until level 2 :P In D2R for example at least white, grey or blue items have a contextual use, as a runeword base, or BIS PVP item or whatever. In D4 they're just litter. The lack of an even the simplest loot-filter makes this worse. I'm still hopeful that they will find a use for these.Yes, yes, they are still working on those, but my main critic point is NOT if current D4 deserves a full AAA price-tag (I paid for the ultimate edition mind you) after so much broad testing, feedback and numerous hotfixes, but IF it deserved the price at launch. If you tell me ""yes, it did"" you're either lying to me or to yourself. So I lost interest and moved on to more polished games. As the saying goes, this is literally more live development than live service: Missing features are brought in after the launch.Tl.dr: Too early, too undercooked. Full AAA price tag completely undeserved, was so at launch and still is IMHO. If Blizzard had taken their time, say 1-1.5 years, this could have been an amazing game. As it stands it's lost many players. Regardless, I'm still full of hopium, instead of copium.";Not Informed;11 December 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
220;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;An ARPG Masterpiece;This is the best diablo. Not only that but it may be the best top down ARPG ever!Let me give you the rundown of positives and negatives.Positives You don't play diablo for the story, but this diablo has an awesome story that I did not expect to be this good. The cutscenes go HARD. I was very impressed with the story this time around.The voice acting. It is superb especially Lilith and Lorath.Map: the map is massive and diverse. Many different Biomes. The over world events are all diverse and different, never repetitive. The strongholds are a blast and each have their own mechanics and stories. So much to find and do.Runs at a smooth 60fps on series X, and the graphics look stellar. Very next gen feeling game despite being top down.Gameplay: this is why you are here and let me tell you it is the best it has ever been in a ARPG. Addictive, fun, satisfying, and challenging!Character progression and builds: its amazing. I am addicted. It is such a deep rpg. Each class is so different I will never hit the bottom. So mucch depth. Build lovers this is your safe space.quality of life stuff: you can respec whenever with little to no penalty, you can teleport in and out of any place including dungeons to sell loot etc with ease, short load times, and without losing progress.co-op is a blast. I played about half the campaign with a friend and it is seamless and a blast!Negatives The quest markers mess up sometimes. Thats pretty much it.I know many had connection issues but I have never had a single connectivity issue. I get into the game immediately, and have never disconnected or even had much lag. I think its a wifi issue not a diablo issue people are having.So far this is my game of the year for 2023! Get it now!;10/10;13 July 2023;1 out of 11 found this helpful.
221;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;Hard to Rate- Turning the Tides towards MMO perhaps.;"I have been playing RPGs since Final Fantasy original on NES, the Immortal, Lagacy of the Wizard, etc. So, a really long time.This Diablo was extremely hard to rate. The utilization of the UI is kind of frustrating at first, but has its similarities to previous Diablo entries. This time the inventory uses a slot system measured by a maximum amount of items, where previously it was a grid to measure space and therefore the size of the item would determine your inventory space. There's some changes to navigating the UI as well, which are tedious but soon adaptable.The gameplay is not bad at all. Controls were precise and easy to use. The graphics were great for an overhead RPG. The cosmetics were excellent all around.All this being said, let's talk about the logistics of the game. Previously, the Diablo franchise had used chapters or ""ACTS"" to maintain and divide segments within the Diablo world. Here in Diablo IV, they use one gigantic map. I said, ""okay, I'll go with that."" However, the enemies are packed everywhere. I know that no one likes an empty map, but they should've dialed it back a notch. You were blessed to catch a break sometimes, especially if you were a Necromancer and had skeletons that would constantly run after far away enemies. Furthermore, the dungeons are no longer randomized. You do them once, get the accolade for it, and that's all. You can redo the dungeon, but it isn't any different.The storyline was ookkaayy. The ending was confusing and left you wondering if the whole thing was a setup by ""someone else,"" to not spoil it. The concept of Lillith was great and so was the art. There was one part of the story that I deemed to myself- unnecessary. It involves a snake. I will not go into further detail due to spoilers.I am convinced that Diablo may be turning towards an MMO platform.--To Blizzard--Change takes time. You have a great game here but this is the first MMOish type Diablo release. Let's try convincing players, both veterans and casual, that Diablo is a fit franchise for this. ESPECIALLY since the studio implemented microtransactions now. Anybody can say what they will, but this was a risky decision. Other games like the Elder Scrolls, Final Fantasy, etc, have enough material to create their own universes, due to length of existence and story development. I guarantee you made some previous Diablo players look at it as a ""really?"" I know, because I was one of them. However, I do think you may have pulled it off. You were extremely lucky. Now you just have to merge previous and new generation Diablo players that this is equally acceptable amongst both.All-in-all I think the game made some drastic changes. Were they bad? I don't think so. They're just different.Final Conclusion: You'll be playing a great game, but is it a Diablo game?";6/10;19 June 2023;5 out of 7 found this helpful.
222;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;"Great gameplay.... ""safe"" writing";"I've taken my time exploring every area, going through the full campaign (and starting Tier III), and doing just about each piece of content. The gameplay itself is well done. The game is fun to play. Story story, though, is not that amazing. It doesn't try anything new, and uses the same tropes from every single ""safe"" fantasy story. It is clear that love and care were taken to make a game that plays well, but the time that could have been spent on more story, doing something new and memorable, etc, was instead spent on making sure there was room for a live service component. I've spent my entire life playing D&D, MMO's, reading fantasy novels, etc and a couple of the characters were decent, but most of the game is just simple tropes to get you from point A to point B so you can start the live service part of the game. Honestly, I took my time leveling, doing the story, watching all cutscenes, and trying to experience everything the first playthrough but I'm not sure how much longer I'll play it after finishing the main story. I've started the ""repeatable stuff"" at the end and it feels hollow. I was in a drought of games to play, with over 10k hours in heavily modded Skyrim in the last 5 yrs, and I don't regret buying it but this isn't going to be that memorable to me in a few months, I have a feeling. Unfortunately, it appears that Activision (I don't call them Blizz anymore) had the story writers spend more time in their formula and making sure there is nothing memorable, funny, or possibly offensive to a single person, rather than writing something truly memorable. The story is just.... meh.";6/10;11 June 2023;7 out of 13 found this helpful.
223;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;They learned nothing.;"Wasted potential. ~15 years of Diablo 3 development & maintenance, and a few years of Diablo Immortal, yet they learned nothing about what makes a good Diablo game in the 21st century.Instead they tried to cater to the Diablo 2 fossils by copy/pasting all the classes & skills from it, and then charged us full price for the same old cr@p that everyone and their granny has already played for 1000 hours 10-20 years ago.No new classes, hardly any new skills, terrible legendary powers, zero innovation or originality. Tries to be MMO-lite but provides zero incentive for grouping up, and doesn't even have a Group Finder or Lobby Creator, or even a decent chat system.Result: a stale-from-the-start mess with zero replayability, terrible class design and no real endgame to speak of, with players abandoning it in droves.I've dragged Diablo 3 over the coals plenty in my lifetime, but it still kept me playing for ~10 years despite having no mod support - mods being the only reason Diablo 2 stayed popular enough. Diablo 3 gave us vastly improved classes to the point where you felt like you were playing something completely new. That is what Diablo 4 is missing - something new to play.The game director's only skill is copy/pasting & cutting corners from top to bottom. Diablo 3 has no less than 8 fully professionally rendered Cinematics. Diablo 4 only has 2, the rest are rendered in-game in much lower quality.The Bestiary is the same 5-6 boring enemy groups copy/pasted across the entire game. Lycans, Skeletons/Ghouls, Ghosts, Goatmen, human Bandits, Fallen, with the occasional cameo of Wasps, Scorpions, Spiders, Bears/Boars and some varied Hellspawn during timed events. As soon as I heard the phrase ""monster families"" I had a sinking feeling in my gut, but I never imagined how bad it was really gonna be.The Endgame...what endgame? They took the worst of Diablo 3 and somehow made it even more tedious, with the same 4-5 variations of Dungeons being considered ""the endgame"" while you grind your way to max level 100 at a snail's pace.Add on top a bunch of one-time irritating side quests with mostly unskippable dialogue, the same 4-5 copy/pasted random events across the game world, a poor excuse for a timed event called Helltide, and a couple of terribly designed ""world bosses"" that appear without any warning so you never know they're there. Because there's no decent chat function or group finder.The Cosmetic shop is a complete fail because in-game colors are terribly washed out to the point where it doesn't even matter what your toon looks like.The game itself has been completely outdone by a mobile game built around Pay2Win. When a P2W mobile game is more fun than D4, then you know it has failed miserably.You would think it was created by Kathleen Kennedy.";4/10;3 July 2023;12 out of 16 found this helpful.
224;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;Disappointing, overpriced, basic game;"The game is not worth the 70 price tag.The positive: The design is awesome, Lilith is perfect, the game feels great to play, it is responsive and the attacks have weight behind them. The cinematics.The negative: The history could have been epic and it really felt epic until almost the end... then it just felt like they missed the mark, or were eager to end it.The builds, the way the skill tree is made there is like 5 builds possible max per classes which is very very disappointing.The constant stuttering is something unbearable.The ""AI generated fetch quests""... most side quests feel like they were made by AI.... go fetch this and go to the other side of the map and come back, which never was the point of a diablo game.The gear system is so basic it's disappointing, stripped of everything that makes a Diablo game with the excuse of ""we will bring stuff later"" but still charging full price for an incomplete game.";5/10;11 June 2023;11 out of 19 found this helpful.
225;Blizzard Entertainment;Diablo IV;Conflicted;"This is a hard review because on one hand the graphics, controls, gameplay, music, and story is great. The game just feels good to play.The main issue is the ""always online"" requirement that Blizzard implemented. The issue with this is that for some reason your character will suddenly get stuck in invisible walls, you literally cannot move, suddenly you either get teleported all over the map of if there are enemies around you, your hit detection doesn't work and they just stand there. Eventually when the server is finally able to catch up to you, you are DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!!!Blizzards explanation is somewhere along the lines of ""the server is trying to catch up with you that is why there are invisible walls."" They basically said to fix this teleport out and re-teleport back in. Seriously? Is this how we can fix this issue?I hope one day there is enough demands that Blizzard releases an off-line mode. There is literally no reason as to why you must absolutely remain online at all times except for Blizzard to spy on you like the Chinese Government.Anyways at this state with the servers and the invisible walls and the no hit detection issues, this game is pretty much borderline unplayable. I don't what to give this but when the game is working, it is a 10/10, but because of the issues with server and stuff I just mentioned, I don't know, maybe a 1/10 cus it is unplayable at this STATE.";5/10;8 June 2023;6 out of 16 found this helpful.
226;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;From playing with friends to a money cow, (personal opinion after first week of playing);It is more of the same, but different.One of the big selling points of Overwatch have been playing with friends, and making new ones. They have now removed this function completely so you have to find people while playing, which would be fine if everything was working. But I does not. Not only is it hard to find someone that actually talks, but to also find someone in the same skill rating range and that actually tries their best.In addition, a lot of people are being thrown around in the skill rating in places they should not be and with the changes to competitive they are stuck there for way to long ruining the experience of other players.This is some of the thing I personally noticed and wanted to highlight in the hopes of this getting better over time. There are also a lot of other problems with the game, but luckily it seams like they are continually working on improving the gaming experience.;5/10;13 October 2022;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
227;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;Could be better;The game itself is alright. However, the game is essentially the exact same thing. Almost immediately we're notified that we won't have the promised pve campaign until 2023, additionally there have been several glitches. It got so bad to the point where one character has been removed from the game! Addition There are glitches where I would get play of the game by doing absolutely nothing... literally. Although I did not like it, they removed the loot box system and replaced it with a shop. The only way to collect free currency is the weekly challenges which only rewards a maximum of 60 coins. If I correctly recalled playing matches rewarded players with 10 coins. It wasn't much but it definitely beats this joke of a system.This game honestly doesn't feel like a sequel to Overwatch. It feels far more like a reboot. While I have enjoyed some aspects of it all in all this has certainly been a let down for me.;6/10;16 October 2022;5 out of 7 found this helpful.
228;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;Overwatch should've stayed as just Overwatch!;"When I say that Overwatch should've stayed as Overwatch, it means they didn't have to make a complete, separate game! Alllll the things they had in this 2nd one, could've literally been added in the 1st one. That's all they had to do. Overwatch 2 is NOTHING different nor special in the slightest. Except for a campaign, but that's all you get really. WHY in their mind would they completely get rid of the 1st one?! Now nobody can go back to that game anymore. It just doesn't make sense. ""Hey guys we gotta sequel now, but let's get rid of the 1st one for good measure."" Like what??? Leveling up is not the same as it was, in fact you're not even leveling up at all. It feels empty. It feels like after you play so many hours, you don't feel accomplished, you don't feel like you're progressing, you don't feel like you're moving up in the ranks. Plus, loot boxes don't exist anymore. Now you have to buy coins if you want anything. Plus this game is FREE now? It's so stupid. In Overwatch, you actually felt like you had a place in the game. You felt like you were getting somewhere. You were proud of how far you came to reach your first bronze, silver, gold, platinum or diamond. You competed with your friends. You felt great about receiving loot boxes to see if you would get coins or skins or anything else. Overwatch is dead....it has been dead. And it unfortunately will never come back to the way it originally was. Let's be real here, 2016-2019 was where it WAS REALLY AT.";1/10;12 July 2023;7 out of 7 found this helpful.

It feels like a ranked game even in quick play. The event (mischief & magic) was fun at first but also it's pretty much to prop Hunt. As well, the event rewards were just lazy it was a re-skin, sprays, and voice lines. As well they didn't even fully change the colors of Ana's arms which I know is not a big deal, but just shows the overall laziness. In Overwatch 2 you're not able to get certain skins without a battle pass, paying about $20-$10 for a skin, or spending a ridiculous amount of time to get ""currency"". I would have gone with a lower rating as well, but they do have fun characters and abilities.

231;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;Great way to pass time.;As a newcomer to overwatch, I really enjoyed it. The base game is quite simple, and not hard to get into. The amount of unique characters in this game is impressive, with almost all of the characters being fun to play as, ass well as a incredible amount of backstop and lore for each of then. The colourful world designe, as well as the cheerfull music in the game really helps bringing this game to life. Yes, the game has its fair share of bugs, not the best queues, and a questionable battle pass, but most of these can be overlooked on regard to how fun the game can be. I highly recommend giving this game a shot. It can be quite a nice refresher compared to other multiplayer shooters we today. Be sure to try the game with a friend.;8/10;23 November 2022;8 out of 14 found this helpful.
232;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;Why you shouldn't play Overwatch 2;"Overwatch 2 is like a 1.1 patch. They remove content, delaying content. PvP and the new battle pass system are the main focus.In the past they announced PvE and many features during trailers that are not even there.Monetarization is a completely scam, you cannot get any good skins during grinding, because it takes more than a half year to play consistently. They fake discounts and uses all - sadly - modern standards of grabbing money.But people are still playing and invest money, poor state of gaming.YouTube: ""The State of Overwatch 2"" by A_Seagull.""Overwatch 2 is free but I still feel scammed"" by zanny.""Overwatch 2 is a New Low in Gaming"" by doob.""Overwatch 2 is Unacceptable Garbage"" by TheWhat Show.""Overwatch 2: The Laziest Sequel"" by The Act Man.";3/10;8 March 2023;3 out of 4 found this helpful.
233;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;The worst game I've ever played;No game has made me want to put a hole in my tv as much as this game. I consistently want to kill myself. It hasn't been fun since 2016. Blizzard is one of the worst developers of all time as well. Since the release of overwatch 2 they have made the game worse with every update. Sombra is the biggest a$$hole and can go fvck herself as well as symmetra and zarya. They like to buff these annoying characters that are already way better than the others and nerf genii who has already been nerfed into the dirt. They also added sh!itty battle pass and store so that you have to pay $20 to get 1 skin for 1 character when there are a lot more.;1/10;9 December 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
234;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;Tf2;"As the Heavy, Scout, and Soldier return from a mission to capture a briefcase, Miss Pauling video calls them to ask how the mission went. She is slightly irritated that they left witnesses that she has to take care of for them. After arriving back at the base, Scout tries to ask her out, but he is unable to think of anything to say to her.At the base, they hear bad news from Engineer and Medic: teleporting bread results in large green tumors inside, leading them to conclude that the mercenaries have the tumors as well, and will all die. The Medic estimates that each team member has about three days left to live. Engineer provides each team member with a wristwatch that will count down to the time of the mercenaries' demises.In face of this news, Spy decides to collect a bucket list in a literal bucket. Spy delegated the task of collecting wishes to Scout, who has filled it with drawings of the Spy being hit by a car and having a romantic relationship with the Eiffel Tower. Spy remarks that his time has been wasted, and angrily bids the team farewell, after giving the Soldier the bucket. The Soldier then takes his bucket and picks up a loaf of bread dropped by the Medic.Afterwards, Scout comes to Spy's smoking room to apologize and seek his help. He confides that he did have a real wish for the bucket list: a date with Miss Pauling. Scout admits to Spy that while he himself is good with girls (a scene with the Tramp Girl appears), he is vastly outclassed by Spy when it comes to ladies. Scout then admits Spy is better than him, and Spy demands that broadcast around the base as payment for his services.Spy agrees to coach Scout in how to behave around a lady. While Scout shows some progress, Spy ultimately declares Scout a failure. When Scout retaliates towards Spy's attitude, Scout decides to do things his own way, which appears to have surprised and impressed the Spy.With two hours left on his death watch, Scout decides to take things into his own hands. He calls Miss Pauling to the base by pressing the alarm button for the briefcase being stolen. She hurriedly arrives on the scene, but is infuriated upon learning that the briefcase is actually secure. While trying to talk to Pauling, the Soldier, Spy and Demoman spectate from another room. Spy is surprised that Scout is doing surprisingly well.Meanwhile, through experimentation, Medic and Engineer have come to the conclusion that the growths in the bread are, in fact, not tumors at all, but a self-aware birthmark that can only thrive in pure wheat. This means none of the mercenaries have tumors, and thus are not going to die. They enter the room that Soldier, Spy and Demoman are in and inform them that they are fine as long as no more bread is teleported. To their horror, though, it seems that Soldier's last wish has been to do nothing but teleport bread for the past three days.Upset at Scout for wasting her ""one day off a year"", Miss Pauling begins to leave. As Scout attempts to get her to stay, he opens a door, only to be confronted by a giant Bread Monster. A fight breaks out, with the other mercenaries rushing to their aid. One of the Medic's pet doves ends up eaten by the monster.During the fight, Miss Pauling attempts to blow up the Bread Monster by using a Payload cart, strapping the Scout's death watch to it to serve as a timer. As Scout attempts to help her, she and Scout end up trapped on the wrong side of the blast doors as the bomb is about to blow up. The two notice that the dove that the Bread Monster ate is flying harmlessly out of the mouth of the monster. They wordlessly agree to jump into the mouth of the Bread Monster, which they proceed to do in the nick of time. The Payload cart subsequently blows up, killing the Bread Monster.Stunned by the blast, Miss Pauling and Scout painfully but quickly recover inside the bread monster. Once she recovers, Miss Pauling admits that the experience was fun. Scout tells her about the death prognosis just as the two are helped out of the remains of the gigantic Bread Monster by the rest of the team. The Medic informs them that only bread mutates, and that they will all be fine (after the Soldier mistakenly states that they will live forever), while the Pyro starts playfully chasing down the remaining small Bread Monster.The story ends with Scout trying to get another date, but Miss Pauling having to decline due to already having spent her one day of vacation this year. She does, however, offer to have Scout to come along at work, though he declines each task Pauling lists until she comes to the task of killing the one who pulled the briefcase alarm, which she says that Scout will already be at.";1/10;1 June 2024;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
235;Blizzard Entertainment;Overwatch 2;Genji too overpowered;My favorite character is the reaper guy. He is very powerfull. Special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.Now about Genji, I know his shuriken does no damage but like why does he even have 24 ammo, game is literally unplayable with the state of Genji currently please nerf.Also Roadhogs hook is one of the hardest skills to master... you have to predict speed trajectory momentum and velocity aswell as healing yourself and tanking... so why remove his oneshot ability?? These game balances make no sense!;3/10;24 April 2023;0 out of 4 found this helpful.
