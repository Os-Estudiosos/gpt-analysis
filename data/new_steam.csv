0;Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.I should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  So right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  None of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.What kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  I’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.The team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.I’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  I wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.Okay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.The hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  Also I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  I won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  If you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.;Recommended;418.7;24/01/2019;2,483;115;;8.5
1;Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise. Graphics Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.  Story The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy. The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me. Gameplay If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything. You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities. Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with. As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.  Grind? I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue. Final Recommendation I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss. Pros-Stunning Game World-Interesting Story-Well thought-out RPG mechanics -Tons of things to do-Exhilarating CombatCons-Lame mid-late game pacing-Poor rendering-Executions aren't greatFinal Rating - 8.6/10If you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

2;Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;"Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity. an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the ""decisions"" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another. chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!";Recommended;234.8;5/10/2018;1,524;32;;8.7
3;Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey  ⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:              - Main Story - 43½ Hours              - Main + Extras - 83 Hours               - Completionist - 137 Hours By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review. ⚔ Gameplay: 🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)🔲 Definitely🔲 Infinitely replayableThe game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game. 😄 Fun: 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy☑️ Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember🔲 Ride of your lifeAs a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did. 🏞 Graphics: 🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game🔲 Good (nothing special)☑️ Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceThe graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work. 🔊 Sound: 🔲 Makes your ears bleed🔲 Bad☑️ Not special🔲 Good🔲 Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceI felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven. 📖 Story: 🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story🔲 It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written☑️ Epic story🔲 MasterpieceWithout spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter. 🧵 Length: 🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee🔲 Short🔲 Average☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)🔲 To infinity and beyondAccording to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.I wish it would be shorter. 💷 Price: 🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price☑️ Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of moneyDepending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore. 🧩 Difficulty: 🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it🔲 Easy☑️ Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too. ⚖ Pros & Cons:  ➕ Pros: + The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all. ➖ Cons: - It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.- Too long. I really wish it would be shorter.- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult. only a few of them get that treatment. ⚙ Bugs: 🔲 Never heard of☑️ Minor bugs🔲 Can get annoying🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsI've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU. ⭕Conclusion: AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.Originally posted by TalePlay: If you've read this far, I want to say thank you and do check our Curator Page called TalePlay.

4;Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;"I bought the Gold Edition, which seems to have a better value. Here's some info on the different editions:Standard Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game) DELUXE DIGITAL PACK: - Kronos pack - contains the full Armour of Kronos armour set, the Hourglass mount, and the spear ""Harvester of Time"" - this pack gives more warrior damage boost- Herald of Dusk pack - contains the full Herald of Dusk set of armour, and the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focused.- Capricornus Naval Pack - contains the Capricornus boat and sailor skins - purely cosmetic.- Temporary boosts to XP and money - boost lasts for 2 hours.Gold Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)SEASON PASS: LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE, THE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece + The Games: Assassin's Creed III REMASTERED and Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTERED. Ultimate Edition (Digital) Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition - Check the Content Info AboveSEASON PASS - Check the Content Info AboveSo, the only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content. Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on. up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on sale, though I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition.Note:  You can not upgrade to Deluxe Edition later on, meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition, and that's money wasted. Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later on, is not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise. You are saving money and getting the best of the game. For Season Pass owners (which is in the Gold and Ultimate Editions) - Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered will not appear in your library as it is a part of, and available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered. So, in order to play Liberation Remastered, you need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered. Both Remasters are slightly better graphically, than their previous versions. You have to launch Assassin's Creed Odyssey once, before trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition. Otherwise, the Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activation, which is not possible anymore.  For any problems with the Ubisoft client: Verify Integrity of Game Files on Steam and if it doesn't work then uninstall the Ubisoft client and delete the current version and redownload the client from the Ubisoft site. If you still have problems then God help you dealing with Ubisoft/Steam support.

20;Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;"(DRM notice: this game requires a Uplay account, requires you to connect to Uplay when starting up, and it also uses Denuvo DRM. DRM is inherently bad for the customer so I wanted to warn you about that.)Far Cry 5 is a decent entry into the series, and often underrated in comparison to previous titles.Honestly, if you played Far Cry 2, 3 or 4 - you know what to expect. Same game, different setting. The main reason people rate it lower than 3 and 4 is because by this point, they've grown tired of the same old formula (and because of the weird ending, but I'm not gonna spoil that... you have to see it for yourself). Far Cry 5 is just as good as its predecessors. That said, let's give this a proper analysis, shall we?You shoot bad guys. This time it's in rural America.It's a Far Cry game. What did you expect? It follows the Ubisoft open world formula of a big world occupied by enemy forces, which you slowly liberate by wiping out enemy outposts like you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rambo. There's a basic but functional stealth system of silent melee takedowns, silent weapons like bows, throwing knives, and silenced guns, and enemies raising the alarm if they see you or find a dead body. You can conquer outposts either by going in slow and methodical, or you can just storm in guns blazing and mow everyone down with an MG. The combat is fun. Controls are pretty smooth, most weapons are satisfying to use, and neither you nor the enemy are bullet sponges. Sometimes you will have to deal with enemy helicopters, or you can fly one yourself to rain death from above. Fun!The only criticism I have compared to earlier Far Cry titles (especially Far Cry 1 and 2) is how the physics engine has been dialed down a bit. Many items are static objects that don't ever move (I kicked a bunch of cans and they just stayed in place... lame), and most cover can't be pierced by bullets, unlike earlier games where thin wooden walls could easily be penetrated by high caliber weaponry. At least the fire spreading mechanics are still there, making the flamethrower a potentially devastating weapon... with which you can easily grill yourself if you're not careful.The game is set in Hope County, a fictional area in the US state of Montana, where a crazy cult is taking over and forcibly recruiting the population. You arrive as a policeman (or policewoman, this is the first Far Cry game with character customization and you get to pick your gender) coming to arrest the leader of that cult, but of course the cultists fight back and you have to run. During the course of the game, you meet with various resistance members and help them fight the cult until they are wiped off the map. The setting is quite enjoyable, especially if you like rural America. As a European, I find American culture quite fascinating, and this game is full of it. All the resistance people are proud American patriots, and you get to see a lot of those weird roadside attractions they have in the rural US, like a park with giant plastic mammoth statues and farms that advertise their tomatoes with giant tomato signs. Very quaint.I got captured... AGAINAs far as the story structure is concerned, the antagonists are pretty interesting and the story overall is competently told. But the way they force you into the main quest missions... yeah, that's definitely questionable. Whenever you earn enough ""Resistance Points"" in a region (by doing side quests or liberating outposts), the bad guys will send a capture party to abduct you. They don't just do it once per region, but several times. When I finished the game, I had been captured at least six times... and if we count the scenes where Faith puts you into a drug-induced trance so she can try and convert you to the cult, that increases to nine times.Nine. Times.And each time, you - of course - manage to escape and kill a whole bunch of cultists in the process. They should have realized that keeping you alive is a bad idea after the second time, but nope. They just keep abducting you and try to convert you to their cause, until you finally kill all the leaders. Of all the methods they could have used to drive the story forward, this is by far the dumbest. It almost feels like the bad guys are deliberately giving you a chance over and over again.The cult leaders are appropriately vile and violent characters, and the acting and animation is really good. I usually hate cutscenes, but I found the ones in Far Cry 5 to be quite engaging, because the characters are so interesting. I have to rate the main story as ""good"", but... the way they keep using that abduction mechanic to drive the plot forward... that's just stupid. So utterly stupid. And the worst part is that it can hit you anywhere once you triggered it. Doing a sidequest right now? Haha sorry, abduction squad is here. Flying around in a helicopter? Yeah there's a sedative arrow in your leg now, don't ask where it came from. It's just dumb.You've seen it before. It's nothing new, but it's good.Really, apart from the dumb way they handled the main story progression with those stupid abduction scenes, Far Cry 5 doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's another competently made Far Cry game. More of the same for people who enjoy this style of game. Open world driving around, shooting bad guys, doing side quests. It even has the same mission types as the previous Far Crys: rescue a friend and man the gun while he drives the truck to your home base, go to a location and kill the enemies, find collectibles and bring them to an NPC, etc etc. The standard fare as usual. Did you play Far Cry 3 or 4? This is like that, except set in Montana instead of a tropical island or Tibet.If you like Far Cry games, you're gonna like this. If you don't, you won't.

23;Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;In a nutshell:Pros:1. Good graphics2. Surprises in the story at the end3. Game physics is good4. More involvement of Bosses in game (unlike Far Cry 4), which is good.5. Adds lot more contents in the game when compared to its predecessors.6. Availability of Guns for hire. OR form Your own squad with AI characters, which gets unlocked as the story progress.7. No more tower capture to unlock a region (although some elements of it exists here too)8. More detailed and realistic gun/vehicular battles.9. Support for Co-op in Story mode.10. Arcade mode for some extra game play.Cons:1. Even on pretty good configuration PC(GTX 1070 8GB), FPS drops to 30 sometimes, but not many instances. Probably because the game is tailored for AMD graphics.2. No option to change difficulty in middle of game story. Need to play out entire story in same difficulty level.3. Too much content in Game User Interface (UI) /Map which causes the UI to be cluttered.4. If You are someone who is moving up the far cry timeline and played FC3 and FC4 before this, You might take at least an hour of game play to understand the game features.5. In gun battles, hit reg not accurate sometimes.6. Co-op in story mode restricted to only 2 players in total (i.e. Yourself and one friend).7. If You invite Your friend to play in Co-op, only Your story proceeds/missions complete, and your friend's does not. Above Pros and Cons should be sufficient if You do not have time to read through the detailed review and need to decide if You want to buy this game or not. More detailed review below.P.S: Please play this game before playing Far Cry: New Dawn, to enjoy the new dawn instalment better.In Detailed Review:The Game:Unlike prior Far cry instalments, this game environment has more modern vibes to it. So, You'll have more modern weapons, and visiting a place on the map reveals it. No more tower climbing to remove cloaking.Basically, the map is a group of islands, ruled over by one main Boss (The Father) and 3 under bosses (His 2 brothers and 1 sister, well not biological though, haha). They together form a cult and make life hell for the natives. Its either join the cult or face Your maker, simple right?So, You play the role of a rookie deputy who will fight Your way to liberate the islands, and there is lots of story and elements to it on the way.The bosses:Each boss brings in their own flavour and elements to the story and game play, which is kind of good and makes missions less repetitive. The more outposts You liberate (not many, may be 4 to 5 outposts per boss) and more missions You complete (given by the natives), the more interest the local boss takes in You, taking you closer to defeat them.The Vehicles:A wide variety of Vehicles available, like trucks, vans, SUVs, boats etc along with the new addition of airplanes and helicopters, which can be used in free roam and missions.Guns for Hire:Basically 2 types:Type 1: CivilianEach civilian You rescue from the cults grasp during free roam can be used as a Gun for hire during next mission, until You release them. They ride with You, they can die for You, kill for You with guns blazing or with stealth. They can be found all over the map. No specialisations as such, good for regular gun fights.Type 2: Story AI CharactersThe other set of Guns for hire are the characters which are unlocked as You progress in main story. This set of Guns for hire are specialists and can be added to your squad. They can be called upon whenever You need them. There are 9 of these specialists which includes 3 animals and rest humans. The human specialists include a sniper, an airplane pilot, a helicopter pilot, a crossbow specialist (for stealth), a missile man etc. You can form a squad with them or call them in separately.Skills:Unlike prior instalments, skills in FC5 can be unlocked by finishing challenges. The challenges (which can be viewed in Map menu) needs to be completed to get reward points. These reward points can be used to unlock skills. Some challenges (for example) are get 10 kills with grenade, 8 kills with knife throw, 20 Melee kills, 5 road kills etc. So, higher the game difficulty, completing some challenges might get a bit difficult as game AI gets better.Skills are similar to FC3 and FC4, not many changes here. One difference I noticed is, no more crafting for weapon bag, loot bag, weapon holster etc by hunting animals for skins. This too needs reward points now. So make sure where You spend Your reward points well. Weapons:Anything and everything from a knife to arrow, pistol to assault and sniper rifles, from Grenade launchers to guided RPGs. If You have DLCs purchased too, You get martian weapons as well. You can carry upto 4 weapons at a time, provided You have unlocked the large weapon holster by using those reward points.Overall I would definitely recommend the game.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 7/10Attention to details: 6/10Thanks for reading the detailed review.

24;Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;I've been a fan of Far Cry since the 3rd game, and was pretty excited for this one. I was not disappointed for the most part. As a fan of the series I have a lot to say about this game, so be preprared for a long read.PROS+ Looks amazing and is well optimized+ Soundtrack is great, including the radio songs+ Joseph Seed, the antagnoist, while not as good as Vaas or Pagan Min, is still good and really feels intimidating.+ Enemies actually have motivation and purpose, as opposed to the mindless pirates in FC3 or the braindead soldiers in FC4+NPCs have stuff to say now, they can tell you about locations, bases, hidden stashes, etc. Some even have conversations with each other that are fun to listen to, huge improvment from the old NPCs who were basically just there to be eaten by animals. The main NPCs are great and memorable too.+Lots more wildlife than the previous games, even have challenges to hunt them+Fishing is cool I guess, it's actually engaging and not an AFK activity like fishing in most games+ Planes and Helicopters are now in the game, and you can buy and customize vehicles instead of having to find them+ The bosses besides Joseph are more fleshed out and have their own methods and personalities.+ Companions are a new addition and are great, they never feel like a burden and can be instructed. Peaches is my personal favorite+ New resistance system is cool, you complete lots of varied activities in the world until you have enough points to face the regional boss and liberate the region.NEUTRAL~ I'm personally not a fan of the setting, I live in the U.S. so Montana isn't all that intersting to me, I'd much rather travel somehwere far away and exotic, however they do pull it off well, the atmosphere is great and I can see why people love it~ Co-op is an absolute blast however friends can't progress with you, you have to do each person's game twice~ Arcade is meh and most of the maps are player made and suck. Wish you could choose to only play Ubisoft mapsCONS- Hunting only yields you money, gone are the days of crafting upgrades, which is a huge shame, the old system was much more engaging.- Weapon variety is pretty bad, most weapons are just reskins of the same gun, even the unique weapons are identical to the standard versions, and they don't require anything to unlock, just more money, which is strange because the standard weapons are locked until you get enough resistance points, you can get the unique AKM before the standard one, it makes no sense at all.- Perks feel underwhelming compared to previous games.- Enemy planes and helicopters spawn way too often, feels more like a chore to kill them rather than and exciting battle.-No bladed melee weapons, I miss cutting people up with my machete/khukuri :(-Microtransactions for skins. Why was this necessary? It doesn't even cost much to unlock things with in-game money.Overall I think the game is good and definitely lives up to the Far Cry franchise, there are issues that bug me but they didn't ruin my experience. I think you'll enjoy this game, it's worth the full 60$, something that can be seldom said about games in this industry nowdays.;Recommended;34.2;31/03/2018;847;28;;8.0
25;Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;The Patriot simulatorI'll start with the bottom line: All in all, its 'yet another far cry game', similar to how FC3, FC4 and to some extent FC Primal look and behave.* Story (with no spoilers) - You're playing as a deputy who tries to arrest a cult leader that has taken control of a county in Montana. This cult is made of religious extremists who believe the end is upon us and they must 'cull the herd' aka kill the weak to save the strong and be ready for 'the collapse' which is their modern version of the biblical flood i guess.Things go to sh*t when trying to arrest him and you and your group end up in a gang-war type of scenario which you must survive till you find shelter. From there, the game actually begins just like any other FarCry game begins - You're saved by an npc that instructs you on how to start managing yourself in the map's sorroundings.Been there, done that.* Map - Roughly on the same size as FC3/4/Primal in terms of total size, but is much more condensed and has a lot more things to do in it. The game overall feels more of a GTA V's free roam when it comes to side-events that you find while traversing it. You will find lots of friendlies and enemies driving around and packed action is basically everywhere.events like hostage rescue are very common, as well as helping out npc's on the road with their random problems.* Followers - The game has added npc follower mechanic which works pretty well. You can add upto 2 specific followers with you and they can level up as they kill enemies to gain buffs. Most of these npc's are scattered across the world map and each has their own buffs, so finding new npc's as followers is a game of roulette that will either reward or screw you in terms of how good the followers will be. You have a total of 9 special followers that are story-bound, and countless of scattered npc's that can be used as random followers, which you can only 'store' up to 3 on your followers list. You can command followers to move to certain spots, kill specific enemies, and even revive you if you're dying. Long press to make them follow you again. Each follower has its own command key so they can do different things if you order them different actions.* Guns - You can have upto 4 gun slots in your inventory (3 big weapons + 1 sidearm) + 1 slot for melee weapons + your own fists which you can use at anytime with your actual weapon (similar to Duke Nukem's kicks in the classic game Duke Nukem 3D). There are a few dozens of weapons in the game, ranging between melee weapons, pistols, smgs, rifles, snipers, and heavy guns like lmg's and rpg's.* Skill tree - Works a bit differently than previous FC games. Its a mashup of badass ranks from Borderlands 2 and previous FC titles. Instead of steady xp gain, you get skill points on certain actions that you do, like completing missions and finishing world objectives and achievements. You spend the skill points on perks just like previous FC titles. All the ammo/holster upgrades are managed through this skill tree, so theres no more benefit in hunting animals for these kind of upgrades. Animal hides can be sold for money but that's it.* AI - Enemy's AI seems to have a small improvement from earlier FC titles. They will take more time to detect you and their aim wont be as punishing as previous FC titles (tested on the hardest difficulty). Follower's AI can be wonky at times, but overall its tolerable.* Arcade mode - An added minigame that lets you play with and against other people in 6v6 matches or in co-op mode against AI enemies like zombies/aliens/humans. There is also a feature that lets you build your own levels and play other people's levels.* Uplay - The obvious elephant in the room - This game has some issues with Steam, even if you buy it directly from Steam, since it forces you to have Uplay installed and tells you to create a Uplay account for it anyway. From my experience, there are a few issues while playing this game that you should be aware of, though your milage may vary:1) When opening and then closing the steam overlay in mid game, there is a slight chance (of about 20%-30%) that the mouse will stop responding. This has been confirmed to only happen in this game so its not a mouse issue. If this happens to you, tab out of the game and tab back in to fix it.2) The more annoying issue: When pressing shift+f2 to bring up the Uplay interface (the equalevant of the Steam interface), there is a good chance the windows' mouse cursor will appear (and stay stuck) in the middle of the screen until you quit the game (will start happening after leaving uplay's interface and going back into the game). The only proper fix i've found for this is to restart the game. Sometimes, switching to 'borderless' mode instead of 'full screen' helps, but its not a guarantee.3) You cant rebind the tab button, which means that if pressing tab in mid game, it will always pause the game and switch to the map view. Sounds nice, but since you can't rebind it, you have to put up with constant game interruptions if you want to shift+tab to the Steam overlay while already in a game menu, as doing this will unpause your game in the process. In other words, you will have to be aware to not be in an in-game menu screen when tabbing into the steam overlay.Im fairly suspicious that these 3 issues are caused deliberatedly by Ubisoft to make Steam users avoid playing the game via the Steam interface and encourage them to migrate into Uplay entirely.* Performance - The game runs at an avg of 80 fps in high-ultra settings at 1440p with Radeon RX 5700XT GPU and Ryzen 5 2600x CPU. No big frame drops seemed to appear and its overall well optimized in my opinion.As for the DLC's...Lost on Mars - A 6-7 hours campaign that puts you on Mars with Hurk. This is a really nice DLC with incredible graphics and superb futuristic weapon designs. Lots of action packed and overall highly recommended.Hours of Darkness - A 3.5-4 hours campaign that puts you on a Vietnam rescue mission. This DLC is quite disappointing as the objectives are very generic with no real incentive to explore the map. Its also fairly easy with the weapons they give you from the beginning. No sense of progress and all in all it feels really rushed.Living Dead Zombies - A very short 1.5 hours gameplay that is split between 7 micro stories that Guy Marvel is trying to form about (yet another) zombie apocalypse. You play the role of the hero in each of these stories and basically he forms them while you traverse it from the world he's building around you, similar to Borderlands 2's DLC with Tiny Tina (but with zero character build up). The DLC shows how Guy Marvel is trying to pitch 7 ideas to different producers for them to build a movie from.This is the most disappointing DLC of the bunch as it offers by far the least amount of content and priced the same as the rest. Give it a hard pass.So, which FarCry 5 version should you buy?The basic one. Period. I've bought the Gold one as i thought the 3 DLC's will give me lots of extra hours to grind on each, but the reality was that only the Mars DLC was worth it, both in terms of length and gameplay/story. Some other things i've recieved were free cosmetics and a few extra weapons and cars that pretty much screamed 'pay to win', alongside some fancy cosmetics. Since in game money isn't a big issue in the game, i simply can't recommend buying the gold version for these extra gadgets as you can buy them later on from vendors anyway.So to sum it up: Buy the base game and the mars DLC individually, when they're on sale. Pass on the rest.In summary:As said in the beginning, when you boil it all up, its basically 'more FarCry', which comes with all the good and some of the bad of the previous titles. So if you loved playing the recent FarCry games, you will sure love this, but it doesn't seem to add anything that is new to the formula.;Recommended;80.2;2/05/2020;192;5;;7.0

And Far Cry 5 stays somewhere in the middle. Anyway, let's get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Cool partner system.+ Decent story. It was interesting at the start, boring in the middle and cool at the end.+ Stashes with cash are mostly interesting to solve.+ Clutch Nixon's challenges are really cool to do especially with a friend.+ Planes and Helicopters are really fun and good addition to the game.Cons:- There are some funny additional missions but most of them are boring.- Most of the additional and even main characters feel poorly written and not interesting.- It's mostly a game with the same mechanics and I don't mind it in some way but why remove good mechanics? For example, you don't need to hunt animals anymore because they only give you money for their skins and not an upgraded holster, etc like in previous parts.- If you play co-op your friend will not complete the story on their character which is some straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because my friend literally couldn't level up skills because the requirement is to kill a boss who we killed but it counts only for the host and he couldn't even buy guns because in his story he didn't reach a resistance level for it. I give this game a 6/10.Far Cry New DawnAnd I want to give a quick review of this game here as I didn't play it on Steam.Pros:+ Cool aesthetic design for everything. Map, animals, bikers, guns. Guns are especially cool.+ Really cool animations on silent kills. Made me wanna say ""oof"" for that poor guy who I stabbed in the eye.+ Story is a sequel of course. Simple and good I would say. + Sorties are especially cool and even unique to the series. Capturing a valuable bag and getting out in many different places is what I really enjoyed. Cons:- Partners are even cooler and funnier here but sometimes I don't get how they are so weak to instantly die from a lvl 1 biker.- Kinda short for its price.I give it a 7.5/10 but buy it on a sale.";Recommended;25.9;24/06/2020;457;11;;7.0
28;Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;"I'm giving this a good review because I liked it and plan to play through it again for giggles, but I'm going to start by saying I don't think everyone will enjoy this.  Here's why I liked it:1.  Shooting mechanics are pretty tight and intuitive.  I know that's really basic, but if it's off in a FPS that just kills it for me.2.  I love the premise.  This setting and the idea of this game just jives with me.  I'm fascinated by prepper culture and cults.  Riding around in a pickup truck shooting guns at a bunch of psychos with my redneck buddies is just my idea of a good time.3.  They actually tried really hard to give this game personality.  Thing is there's not a lot of acting in the game, it's not an RPG, but what's there is really solid.  They took great pains to make it really look like Montana.  You will hate the villains and you will like the good guys (Poor Jess!). they did a lot with very little.  Also the soundtrack of this game is freaking amazing, and it looks really good.4.  I'm a working adult, I like games I can play for 20 minutes and get something done.  I also like story driven FPS.  This works for me.Here's why I think other people wouldn't like it:1.  Very, very loose approach to the narrative.  If you are one of those people who loses interest in a show when the characters do something that doesn't strictly make logical sense, or you lose your mind when you encounter a plot hole, you're going to hate this.  If you can just kick back and say ""it's just a game"", or make up the reasons in your head why something happened, (i.e. you have a strong suspension of disbelief like I do) you'll be okay.  But a lot of things happen that just don't make any sense, if that bothers you, you won't like it.2.  The multiplayer aspects didn't thrill me, though I like the Arcade feature, that one's good, the rest... meh.3.  The bullet drop with sniper rifles drives some people crazy.4.  A friend of mine who tried this thought it was more like an RPG, and while it has a few light RPG style elements, it's not an RPG.  It's a shooter with some character customization.I highly recommend you buy it on sale, even if it sounds good to you.

32;Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 784,72;"DISCLAIMER: I hate Ubisoft's open world games to an exponential degree and as such I had no interest in W_D2. However following the word of mouth, I got into the game a few weeks back. This review is for people who were burned by WD1 or just interested people in general  PROS: +Adapts a wider colour palette for San Francisco, ditching the depressing Greyish tone from WD1 altogether.+The option of completing the entire game non-lethally.+A casual, more light-hearted story that is self-aware and reflects upon the current Internet culture, with wacky characters.+Character customization is more diverse as opposed to the first game's preset clothing.+Radio towers, a plethora of collectibles and outposts have been removed altogether. +You have a lot more options with hacking. Call the SWAT on a NPC or place him on a gang's hitsquad. Cause a static vehicle to accelerate forward much to the surprise of the driver. This culminates in what people call Emergent Gameplay.+Online activities like Bounty hunter, Invasions and Co-op operations lend to longevity.+PC Version is also a significant step-up from first one. Favours numerous graphics options and a FOV slider. CONS: -Unsatisfying Gunplay. Customization of firearms is barebones.-Basic Stealth system. Cover mechanics is janky AF.-Braindead AI.-Vehicles controlling is more arcade-y. but improved from the first game.-Some rather bland mission designs. (Go to X, Hack Y, Watch a cutscene, Mission complete) VERDICT: Watch Dogs 2 came as a surprise to me. It got rid of a lot of stuff that Ubisoft is infamous for and opted for a better game world, the result is a far superior product than the previous title. It's not an absolute ""OHMAGERD 10/10 GAYME HAS DOGES IN IT"" that some people claim it to be but Ubisoft is making the right changes in its IPs, albeit little ones.

40;Ubisoft;For Honor;Action;R$ 129,99;"Joined last year on a sale week. Started playing and immediately got hooked. I was skeptical at first because folk were always on about ""OP this / OP that"" and ""This isn't balanced"", but I can be a bit of a glutton for punishment, was charmed by the game's theme, and wanted to see for myself.I've spent a nigh 500 hours in the game so far, I'm almost Rep 60 so I've gotten my feet wet with this for sure. In my time playing, I have:-Been surprised there was even a Story Mode & vs. A.I. options.-Gotten completely obliterated in PvP to the point of feeling so helpless I may as well just stand still.-Raged so hard my neighbor called to see if I was okay.-Have had my wounds salted constantly by terrible server stability and bad matchmaking rolls.-Cooled my head and gathered advice from Veteran players. realizing a lot of what I was doing was wrong.-Discovering that mastering the art of Parry is what makes the game a lot easier.-Learned that playing an unfamiliar character without practicing its movesets in Training is an awful idea.-Realized that while some characters have meta strategies, there's always a window of opportunity to get out of it (e.g. Cent Cutscene.)-Found out the reason most complain about OP/Imbalance is because they don't take the time to learn how to handle characters. especially new characters.-Exclusively plays PvP after beating the Story Mode and Warrior Trials.-Understand that this game is very VERY reflex dependent.-Has gone 1v4 with both teams breaking, 3 of my teammates dead and yelling at me, and I won with barely any HP left as their yells then turn to praise.-Tirelessly strive to get better at characters I liked.-Is now capable of destroying Rep 100+ so long as I keep my focus.-Playing while drunk is both stupid and great at the same time I've yet to decide if it's a good or bad idea.-Understand ""off days"" will happen where I just can't find a groove and my reaction times are dead. it happens to everyone.This is one of those games where, even if you go into it with a cool head, even if you say you don't get upset by games. something stupid will happen that's 100% out of your control, and it will piss you off. But then, you have so much fun with the gameplay/theme itself, you just keep coming back for more.If you're on the fence about buying this game and find yourself wary from the Mixed reviews? Just give it a shot, come to your own judgment, but I'll tell you right now. don't give up if you get destroyed. People think this game is easy, but it's not. You can't win just by picking Oroachi and spamming Light attacks. It might work for a bit, but you WILL find someone who knows how to deal with that, and you WILL be made helpless with your one-trick strategy. Branch out!FOR HONOR is a game about learning your character(s), and then learning how to deal with other characters as your character. Attack speeds, delays, punishments, mobility, counters. there's a lot that are factored in, and the system is a lot more intricate than it seems.Sure, matchmaking and server stability may be frustrating, but unless you have horrible luck, it's doesn't stay that way forever. Sometimes stepping back from the game to breathe is a good idea, sometimes going into VS A.I. for a bit (or for some Orders) will ease the stress. But keep with it. let loss be your fuel, have shortcomings enable your strive for greatness.DON'T get pissed at your teammates, just because you're hit doesn't mean it was on purpose. Just because they're not near you, doesn't mean they're not being helpful. Look at yourself and see what YOU could have did better. to stay by them, or to better survive when solo.Above all, have a good time.Metas come and go, server issues aren't being ignored by Ubi (which is why they do maintenance.)I played Valkyrie pre-rework and still kicked ass in PvP once I learned her, as tough as it was, because 'weakness' is only a perspective. Now post-rework? I can be pretty scary with her. I'm not infallible, I'm not ""the best"", but I hope you understand what I'm getting at.You keep at something long enough with a willingness to learn? You will go far in this game.";Recommended;1,689.1;8/04/2019;532;19;;8.0
41;Ubisoft;For Honor;Action;R$ 129,99;"Edit: If you've stumbled upon this review somehow, know that most of these complaints have actually been fixed or otherwise addressed and this is not really accurate anymore. I honestly want very much to be able to recommend For Honor. The core gameplay is absolutely unique, taking the spirit of the fighting genre and turning it into something new and exciting. It's smooth, intuitive, heart-pounding action with the depth to keep you constantly learning and improving and getting better. And when it all comes together, it feels amazing. Not to mention how astonishingly beautiful the animations are. We as gamers tend to gloss over games having unrealistic animations so it's truly mind-blowing when you sit there and realize just how incredibly realistic your characters move around in For Honor no matter what they're doing. But the heart of this game is tainted. Tainted by greed. And it truly does ruin an otherwise fantastic game. Now to start, For Honor has an in-game currency called ""Steel"". You get Steel by playing the campaign, or doing daily ""orders"", and you even get a little after every match. And this would be all well and good if Steel was just for buying cosmetics. It would be a nice progression system to keep you playing and drip feed you extras as a reward. But no, that's not where this story ends. Because this game also has another very important progression system: gear.And gear is not just cosmetic. Gear has stats. And this gear can have a lot of stats. The difference between a fresh character (0) and a fully upgraded set of gear (108) is nothing short of downright unfair. When you first start out, you'll be playing against other players playing the same exact hero you are but hitting twice as hard, taking half damage, using almost no stamina, getting revenge four times as fast, or many other numerous advantages depending on what stats they invested in. You can win if you're the better player, sure, but you have to be a MUCH better player.So this system in concept is not terrible. It allows you to choose strengths and weaknesses for your hero to fit your playstyle. That's great! But the problem is that getting maxed gear is a massive, massive grind. It took me roughly 70 hours of gameplay to finally fully outfit one single hero in 108 gear. Does that sound bad? Well that's still not it. Gear is divided into 3 rarities: grey, blue, and purple. So if you want to accelerate your gear grind, you might figure that you'll just blow all your Steel on gear crates until you get a full purple set, and then start upgrading. Seems like a solid plan, right? But whoops, purple gear can't drop until you're Reputation level 3 or higher with your hero, and this information is NEVER PRESENTED IN GAME. So in effect, trying to buy gear crates before you're Reputation 3 with a hero is a complete and utter waste of Steel, and you have no way of knowing this unless you read guides or other community resources. And here's the real kicker: the matchmaker literally doesn't consider your gearscore when making a match. Ubisoft fully intended for brand new players to be getting put up against maxed out players. So if you were thinking ""well if I just get matched with people who have similar gearscore to me, this doesn't sound so bad"", consider your totally reasonable dreams crushed. Because if you haven't guessed by now, Steel can also be bought with real money. Ah, now see with that in mind, all this seemingly senseless game design suddenly starts making a very sinister kind of sense. Why con people out of Steel by intentionally providing only vague descriptions of how loot works? To get them to buy more! Why have a matchmaker that regularly puts together extremely imbalanced, one-sided matches? So that players get frustrated that they don't have good gear and potentially spend money on Steel to accelerate their gear grind! Why lock purple gear behind Reputation levels, anyway? To get people to spend money on Steel to spend on Champion Status so that they can grind Reputation levels faster!And that's how they see For Honor. They see it as a way to milk money out of you. This is easily one of the most innovative and fresh competitive multiplayer games of recent years, but Ubisoft has mutilated and perverted it into the sick and twisted cash cow that now stands before you. I am truly heartbroken at what could have been, and I can only hope that with enough critical feedback, eventually Ubisoft will give For Honor the respect it deserves as a video game and not as a psychologically manipulative microtransaction machine.";Not Recommended;416.5;28/04/2017;1,204;22;;7.0

57;Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;RPG;R$ 149,00;"Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment. worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream ""Fus Ro Dah!"", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. ""Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing.""I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!";Recommended;1,757.6;28/04/2022;604;327;;10.0

62;Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;RPG;R$ 59,99;Greetings: My grandson talked me into trying Fallout 4. I'm an older player (65) who enjoys video games. I am very impressed with the game overall though I do wish I didn't have the CTD's and other issues with the game. But the ability to do the kind of building along with the post war setting has been a lot of fun. Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try. I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things. I do use quite a few mods and I'm sure the contributes to the CTD's etc in the game. I thing Bethsadia has done a great job presenting this game. I played the original Fallout many years ago. Having learned how to make video's of the gameplay and posting on youtube (mostly for my grandson to see my settlements) has been a nice side benefit of playing fallout. I would recommend the game and using mods...just do all you can to ensure things are loaded correctly.;Recommended;2,617.9;26/03/2017;768;35;;8.0
63;Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;RPG;R$ 59,99;I'll keep this short.If you want to play an excellent role-playing game where you can create a truly unique character and feel like your decisions have real consequences. Where every decision counts and you are constantly being presented with those decisions. Where factions, tribes and groups have a real impact and significantly affect the world.Play Fallout: New VegasIf you want to play an excellent looter-shooter with finely honed and extensive crafting systems that allow you to have full control over your customisation. Where you don't have to rely on VATS for shooting and weapons feel satisfying to fire/swing. Where power armour is true to its name and really is powerful but also realistic.Play Fallout 4These are two very different games and which one you should play is down to what you want to experience. Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best RPGs ever made but has terrible shooting mechanics and its looting systems are lacklustre. Fallout 4 has excellent mechanics and has one of the best looting and crafting systems in the RPG genre but its storytelling is rather linear and your choices are limited and often quite inconsequential.That's my two-penny's worth;Recommended;183.4;23/10/2019;796;25;;8.0

68;Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;RPG;R$ 59,99;"Yeah, I've played it for a little bit.In all seriousness: this game has divided fan opinions, but in short: if you don't mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to do, then I'd recommend this game for you. I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:The good:+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like  laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace ""regular"" enemies depending on the player level.+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.The bad:- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.The mixed:* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games. Luckily, the bad retconning is limited to minor details only.* Creation Club. Like most of the world, I'm against paid mods, but fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything. In fact, they seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or two, so you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoever.In the end, I don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyone...so let me put it this way:If you prefer more in-depth roleplay, then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3.If you don't mind that and the flaws listed above too much, then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10. For what's it worth, I've certainly enjoyed it.";Recommended;4,694.5;10/10/2018;459;31;;7.0
69;Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;RPG;R$ 59,99;How to make Fallout 4 a decent ROLE-PLAYING gameYou might already know that Fallout 4 is a step backward from predecsessors when it comes to role-playing. So first download and install these mods: (Also note this is just my personal recommendation of mods)- Outcast and Remnants- Project Valkyrie- Fusion City (optional)- Depravity Evil Role Playing mod- Diary of a Madman- Start me Up (Alternate start mod)And that's it you're good to go. You can be whatever you want with these mods, you want to make peace with all factions? sure go ahead. You want to kill every factions and leaving with only you and your raider gangs to colonized the Commonwealth? sure go ahead.Another recommedation of mods that i personally use:- Real World Damages.     This mod will remove the bullet sponge throughout the game and can be really useful to   conserve ammo and your luggage. And also this mod will make you kill enemies easier, but  of course the NPC can also kill you by instantly, so neat right?- Full Dialog Interface.     Bring back dialog box options like in New Vegas.- Binary Speech Checks.     Makes the speech checks binary like in New Vegas.- Survival Options.     Bring back the quicksave or autosave options when playing the game on survival diificulty   mode. Because you don't know when the game would randomly crash right? this will   become a lifesaver.I already have 7th playthrough with this game and i will keep playing it from time to time.Now enjoy with your new fresh playhtrough Fallout 4.;Recommended;844.4;12/11/2021;413;8;;8.0
70;Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Action;R$ 79,00;"Okay, as a 50+ year old gamer who's been playing since the 1970's I know my limits and I tend to stay away from ""twitch"" games where reaction times have to be razor sharp. With that in mind I avoided this game for a while, in spite of having enjoyed and finished every previous DOOM iteration from the beginning. When it went on a great sale I figured ""what the heck"" and decided to give it a try, thinking it might be a short-lived experiment. Boy was I wrong. The controls are intuitive and easy to master. The encounters are a blast and even failing is pretty fun as you figure out where you went wrong. I'm playing on the second level of difficulty and finding it challenging but just challenging enough to make it a lot more fun. The music and graphics are also excellent and add to the excitement.I do find that the best technique for surviving a difficult battle is to to just pace myself, taking bites out of the boss and avoiding going toe-to-toe with them as I run and jump around. I keep flaming and death punching the baddies to keep my armor and health up and I choose a weak one every now and then to chainsaw and get the ammo up. I can't really recommend this game enough. It's well balanced and exciting but not too overwhelming and it really rewards the creative use of weapons and using actual strategies. If you're old like me, don't be afraid and give it a go. You'll be glad you did.";Recommended;38.7;15/08/2021;1,465;23;;8.0

79;Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Action;R$ 79,00;It's the raw cerebral intensity of Quake married with Doom's enemy roster and its violent, cathartic attitude. Enjoying this game requires a certain frame of mind, a certain willingness to push yourself and to think in the heat of the moment. But it's extremely rewarding if you meet it on its own terms. Nearly every weapon feels like it has a significant role, a stark contrast to Doom 2016's promotion of 2 weapon playstyles. Ammo counts have been massively reduced, pushing the player towards intelligent use of their loadout. Overall, the way I would describe this difference is that Doom 2016 treats its weapons as a set of toys, in which any can be used at any time without too much consequence. Doom Eternal treats them as tools, and you have to use them well to achieve success.The Doom Slayer is more mobile in every possible way and the combat is even more fast paced. Enemies are smarter, more aggressive and more varied across the board. New abilities like the blood punch, flame belch and ice grenade have been added, and provide even more tactical depth.The end result of all of this is a hyper-intense gameplay loop of constant movement, weapon swapping, and decision making. It makes you feel like a demon-slaying god when you finally overcome. It's extremely engaging to the point that I keep coming back even after like 4 playthroughs.All in all, from a gameplay standpoint it's one of the best SP FPS games ever, and a clear improvement over Doom 2016 in all of the ways that matter most. There's really not much else like this in the modern market. In an age in which arena shooters and movement based shooters are dying and the market is overwhelmingly shifting towards slower, less intense genres like tactical shooters and Battle Royales, it's nice to know that a game like this can still be made and find success. I'll get sappy for a second and say this: Thank you, id Software. You're the only AAA developer that still cares about the things I value in a shooter.;Recommended;139.5;17/11/2020;645;12;;10.0

92;Valve;Dota 2;Action, Strategy, Free to Play;Free to Play;"If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.Let me put that into perspective:  541 Days and 16 Hours.  Of dota 2. I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was ""addicted"" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.But I've also relatively learned nothing.Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people,  because  of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: ""what if I just did ... instead"" or ""what if I just played on a more casual level"". The issue is, that dota  feels  more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.Thank you for all that you  have  done for me.

99;Valve;Dota 2;Action, Strategy, Free to Play;Free to Play;"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.1. general thoughts and how i started:I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music""  or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of ""oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat";Recommended;9,560.3;13/04/2018;828;100;;1.0

101;Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;Bought VR  INDEX for retirement. Son built me a gaming computer. Took 8 months for a graphics card. (decent price). All lit up! First game was Half Life. Can't play anything else. I was spoiled to other games without a doubt. I'm a newbie to all this. But the graphics, sounds, gunfights, humor, etc...., was exhilarating.

102;Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;Honestly - if you are just getting into VR, I'd recommend waiting a bit with this game and to start with other VR games. Why?

103;Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;"10/10 would wait 15 years again.EDIT: Well, this is getting more eyes than expected and that sounded bad. In a nut-shell, I really love this game, here's my experience, spoiler free so far:The first 10 seconds were breathtaking, literally. I've been playing VR since 2018, a lot of games, and while the first moments of it were amazing, the feeling of presence went down a bit as I went along, playing more games. But this, this is something else. The attention to detail is amazing.Performance is fantastic, I don't really know how they manage to pull that quality and achieve steady 90 fps. That's a technical achievement for sure.As for world interaction / controls, they are the best they can possible be. I've played Boneworks and having physics everywhere is kinda interesting, but just as a concept. Going up a ladder in Boneworks or climbing was awful. The rest was good.HL:A merges the best of two worlds. There's physical interactions for moments where they are needed, but they won't get in your way at all. And I really love that, because is just a frigging game, not a simulation. For example, going up a ladder here, is simple. Opening a door too. It won't get smashed in your face, only features necessary collisions. Also I really love how they went all in and gave physic properties to some enemies. That increases immersion by tons!The hacking puzzles, I had my expectations low, but oh boy, I was really wrong. They are quite fun to do, they are challenging but not tiresome. They provide random patterns so the challenge always stay fresh.The sounds are amazing, I had to take my helmet because I thought a rat came into my room. Then I thought it was a faulty hard disk. Nope. It was the game. I believe the sound experiments they did with CS:GO carried over here and it really shows. Character voices were a bit loud tho.The Half-Life winks are amazing. And for someone who played them all, spent 10 years making a HL mod and basically kickstart a game dev career, it was tear inducing.My only complain is the ammo system. While I love the Tresspasser reference (""Two mags left!"") I really wish I could store back some pistol ammo. I thought that was going to bit a bit more arcade-y, but it's okay, it really helps to build up some tension.I was going to try the game for a bit, ended up playing like 5 hours straight. Couldn't really put it down.The upgrade system is a nice addition. Also for the different enemy types. It's an evolved Half-Life in every way, and is what I expected and much much more.Now, I will get a bit sad for other companies, because they set the bar incredibly high.AAA VR games will be like this, or better, and can't say how really happy that makes me.Go and play it right now and be part of history as this is the VR break trough everybody expected.";Recommended;49.5;24/03/2020;2,321;372;;10.0

107;Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;I can barely form words after the ending of this game. I will never spoil it for people who have not gotten there yet, so I wont go further into it.This game is a literal masterpiece. From the visuals, to the music, to the story that leaves you questioning everything, Valve has managed to create a VR title set in the Half-Life universe, that rivals all other Half-Life titles. Valve, Half-Life and their other titles saved me from a very dark time 13 years ago. And every Valve title that comes out I give my full attention. This game brought back the feelings of mystery, wonder, and concern on how my favorite characters were going to end up. Even with the knowledge of future events, as this is a prequel, it left you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The story was brilliantly written, and no one could have for seen where it was going. A pivotal roll in Half-Life's overall story and a must play for any fan of the franchise. The graphics were absolutely stunning, and the Source Engine has been changed for the better. Comparing Source with Source 2 is like Source Gold with Source. Stunning difference! Physics are still wonky from time to time, but this made me appreciate it even more. Just like old times!Valve seems to already be on top of patches, so I'll leave the little bugs alone as they have been updating it pretty often over the last few days.I have some issues with how it functions for lower end headsets, like the Samsung Plus, as grenade throwing can be a bit wonky with the controllers going outside the camera's zone. But I don't really think this Valve related per-say, though the amount of times you need to USE grenades could be a bit lower. But all in all, for a lower end Windows headset like mine, I don't have many grips. Controls worked flawlessly and all responded correctly. I used continuous motion but I did find myself using the Teleport to get to places quicker. So a nice medium mix between the two was my sweet spot. Lots of options to mess around with, especially if you get motion sick.I must point out the VAST amount of options you have available. Valve thought of a lot of people with this title to appeal to as many as they could. From Colorblind options to Light Sensitivity for people who suffer from Epilepsy. You can even play with one hand. Teleport, Smooth Motion, and Hybrids are BOTH options. So people who like either one, or both, can use what they are comfortable with. Valve just added Smooth Turning and they also have snap turning if it makes you motion sick. Play around with it, you'll find your sweet spot.All in all, for any Half-Life and Valve fan, this is a MUST! If you don't have a VR to play it, go grab a cheaper one and experience it for yourself. You DON'T NEED an Index to play this game! If you're sure VR is not your thing, go watch a play through on YouTube and support Valve to keep encouraging them to make more games like Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. They seem to have their spark back, and by the gods the STILL have what it takes to make masterpiece games.This final message, though I know they will never see it, is a Thank you to Valve. Thank you for making this game. Thank you for taking me back to a time where I discovered this series. And thank you for continuing to influence my life with all the things you have done for us! Please keep making games, and Thank you so much!;Recommended;46.2;25/03/2020;1,441;24;;10.0

109;Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;"About 3 hours in, I need to take a break. Here are my initial thoughts in easily-digestible point-by-point form:The game's tech outperformed even my pretty significant expectations. It's by far the best looking (and sounding) VR game I've played. Crucially, the image quality is fantastic, with absolutely no visible aliasing outside of very extreme cases of fine specular detail. And despite all that it maintains a pretty solid 144 (!!) FPS. Sure, I have a fast PC, but it's still a highly competent showing from the engine.The grabbity gloves are an absolutely amazing mechanic. The first 2 times I tried to use them it was a bit awkward, and my reaction was a slightly disappointed ""hmm, that's it?"". The third time it felt better. The fourth time it felt absolutely amazing. And from that point on I just grabbed and threw stuff around everywhere without even thinking about it. This is an extremely polished mechanism of interaction.The attention to detail is great. From startling the cat from the first balcony, over the extremely cool looking puzzles to the interactions with NPCs, to the major scenes, all of it looks like it had a lot of care put into it.Even Valve doesn't have access to magic. While the physics are better (more stable and more conducive to smooth gameplay) than anything else I've played, it's still not too hard to make things explode.Headcrabs. ♥♥♥♥ those.Overall, I can already confidently say that everyone who has access to a VR system should absolutely play this game.";Recommended;4.6;23/03/2020;2,007;73;;10.0

117;Valve;Portal 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to sciencePortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to T2: Judgement Day when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.Pros+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this. +Stephen Merchant and J.K Simmons did an absolutely terrific job. Ellen McLain’s performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original!+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by Mike Morasky and The National. +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story. +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. Cons-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV.-Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.  The Bottom LinePortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson. perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer. Highly recommend it to……everyone. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try. My Rating: 10/10  Thank You :D;Recommended;31.4;28/06/2020;288;27;;10.0

143;Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 299,90;I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.  I found it was full of trolls.  Don't waste your time with Red Dead Online.;Recommended;127.7;14/11/2021;741;8;;10.0

148;Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 299,90;I've played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressive! And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law.;Recommended;362.6;9/09/2021;847;11;;10.0

161;Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 99,50;This is hands down the best detective game I have played. I love the noire style, and all the characters are well thought out and well written. There are a few problems with the core mechanics of the game, but they do not get in the way of the story. If you get Widescreen Fixer to fix the 30fps cap, the game will run like butter. I've only encountered one game breaking bug with Widescreen Fixer and it was in an optional side mission, and you can always just toggle it off at that point in the game. Pros:-Great story-Fun gameplay-Good acting-Likeable, well written charactersCons:-30fps cap without Widescreen Fixer, and even that isn't a perfect solution-Some small, but noticable glitchesOverall: I definitely recommend this game, especially if you can pick it up on sale4/5;Recommended;33.4;23/06/2017;219;5;;10.0

164;Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 99,50;L.A. Noire is a detective game, simple as that. If you're looking for another shoot everything rampage game like GTA just because this game is made by Rockstar then this is not the game for you. Sure there is shooting, but you won't be allowed to kill everyone in sight, running people over will affect your case rating etc. The Atmosphere	  Personally, I love the setting of the game, the late 40s jazz theme mixed with golden age Hollywood as well as a classic noir feel makes for a great mix, but while the storytelling is good, it's not all there. The story feels a bit like it's jumping around without finishing everything off, Rockstar gathered enough story for a movie, but not a 20 hour game. Because of this you will be left with extra things that feel like they are just there to fill up an hour of your time and parts of the story that are never properly concluded. This being said, the story has some great parts towards the second half of the game and does a great job 80% of the time, however the ending will feel incomplete.  Gameplay and Fun	 It's fun to drive around and using your siren to move people out of the way is great. The car chases are exciting at first but end up being repetitive, as with all the chases. Shootouts feel this way too and there are one or two that will feel boring. The combat tends to feel stiff from time to time. For an open world game it is very linear and the free roam mode itself actually takes some working out to access. Street crimes are fun to attend to and interrogations are challeging. The clue finding in the game is brilliant and walking around the crime scenes never gets old although you will quickly work out the set structure to finding all the clues. Sound	 The sound in the game makes for great immersion, no complaints here really. The hint sounds at crime sounds can be turned off if they make the game too easy and the whole feel of the sirens and the radio really sells the 40s atmosphere. Graphics	 The facial expressions are the best part about the graphics, I didn't notice too many hiccups in the graphics and if I did they didn't distract from the game. The faces of people look incredibly lifelike and all the other graphics are good too. The sunny setting of Los Angeles adds a bright feeling to the game. Replayability	 While you do have the option to replay your cases to get all clues and perfect your interrogation this game is likely to be one you will only play the story of once, it's still fun to drive around and do street crimes but the cases tend to be something that's best as a one time thing. Verdict	 Overall this game is great fun and a nice step away from GTA while still keeping to the Rockstart format. It feels fresh but also familiar. The graphics look very good for a game that came out in 2011. You will feel very immersed in the time period through use of sound and surroundings. The open world side has something to be desired and Los Angeles doesn't exactly feel as alive as GTA 4's Liberty City or Watch Dog's Chicago, it doesn't have much of a personality, the characters do. If you're looking for a good open world game, this isn't it, if you're looking for a good story with a mix of puzzle and regular shoot/drive gameplay and well designed characters then this is it. Get this if: You like a good story You want diverse gameplay that makes you think You like the Noir settingDon't get this if: You want full freedom in an open world You want to go on a killing spree You don't care about story  8.5/10;Recommended;20.5;2/11/2014;201;6;;10.0

Could have used more content to flesh the origin of Cal Kestis and his journey entirely. Introduction Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. It follows the story of Cal Kestis, a Jedi who survived order 66 by hiding in a planet as a scrap worker. It features elements from multiples sub-genres in the action category and incorporates them to elevate its gameplay further. From lightsaber combat to climbing and soul-likes bosses, the game grabs a bit from each of the best titles but not to the point those mechanics would obscure its own identity. Gameplay The combat is simple but also is a lot of fun. It has vast layers put into it that can appear rather lackluster at first. Still, they are intelligent choices from the developer. Cal Kestis has access to his lightsaber for physical combat and the force to open his options. Lightsaber techniques can range from throwing it towards enemies before it comes back. Different combos or forms, while the force can range from pushing back grenades towards enemies, force pulling, slowing enemies, and more.Players have a ton of options when facing the stormtroopers. You can push them off cliffs, throw them into one another, reflect beams at them, or cut them down with parries, to name just a few. It gives the player freedom to how they will approach any encounter with them or try new ideas. Hurl something at them, put them in front of their own blaster, forcing them towards you. The game has a lot of  possibilities.The platforming aspect of the game is also again, a successful decision in design. There are multiple ways to reach an objective on the map. For example, you can get to the next goal, die, take another path, and achieve that same destination. What is great about this is that those paths are very different when it comes to traveling itself and that they reward exploration. You can visit areas in the order you want, even as far as to go to planets you are not prepared for or discover secret places to visit later.It borrows aspects from games like Zelda, Metroid, Uncharted, Dark Souls. It then incorporates Cal Kestis mechanics into them to make them unique to the game. Puzzles and exploration being limited until you unlock new abilities, platforming that involves using the force to expand one's reach. Approach to level design, and finally combat that mixes dodging, parrying, smart use of the force and lightsaber combat.It is rewarding to be able to visit prior planets and discover that now you can take that path that was blocked before. Enemies being added in locations and exploring side stuff such as collectibles or hidden ways. Enemies have a defense meter, like a shield of sorts and until the player doesn't deplete that they won't be able to damage them. The combat is focused on reaction to how the player reacts to the enemy's attacks and groups of them. All of them have unblockable attacks, and bosses are ferocious with brutal powers and agile movements. Strong points The strong points are its story, that while it has some flaws, it is an enjoyable journey and manages to captivate what makes Star Wars so great as a franchise. The gameplay doesn't get boring because of new enemies showing up from time to time, keeping it fresh, along with the variety of options the player has. Bosses are exciting, particularly the last ones are hard to beat, and they give intense duels.The integration of elements from other games is a concept that I like. Bringing a more refined quality in gameplay but also being careful not to let those elements get to carried away and making the game into a copy of those other games. Finally, customization while the ponchos and ship can be some recolors. the lightsabers have a lot of customization into them. All colors are present except for red. you can change the hilt. The material, the handle, just about everything about them, and let's be honest lightsabers are very cool. It allows one to personalize the aesthetics of Cal Kestis to suit their particular tastes. Story The plot revolves around Cal Kestis, a young man who works to earn his living on a planet controlled by the empire. The plot follows up after the purge of the Jedi after order 66, and Kestis being a Jedi padawan, spends most of his days in hiding. One day, however, he is discovered by the empire. After escaping certain death, he ends up meeting Cere Junda, a former Jedi who managed to escape the Purge of Order 66 and the pilot Greez Ditus, the Mantis ship's owner.Without spoiling too much, the story is good, but both the beginning and the ending of it lack specific amounts of flesh. The start of the game is sprung while the end is abrupt. However, the rest of it is rich in detail, with information on the planets that you visit, references to famous characters and events. Good pacing that allows for character development and for the player to get to know these characters.The exploration of planets adds layers to the lore game, especially if you already heard of them before. The story has the premises of a Star Wars film. Comedic moments that can give a laugh or darker ones that can emanate conflicting thoughts or uncertainty of how things will play out. It is fantastic and one of the best aspects of the game. Some Notes The games run faulty on a GTX 1060. it runs okay in a GTX 1070 and anything above that it runs flawlessly. I could notice that in 1060, there were a lot of frame drops, so I would not recommend it for GTX 1060 users unless you don't mind playing in 30 FPS, which is less than ideal. There are also some bugs such as getting stuck in a wall or BD never turning off the scanner light, but those were few, rare instances.UPDATE: So users report the game doing well on a GTX 1060, while others said it has lots of frame drops. In our experience, the game did not run well on a 1060 but it did on a 1070. If you have a 1060, you will have to try it yourself to see if it runs well or not. Conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is probably one of the best games released in 2019. While the game doesn't manage to make something revolutionary or unique, it certainly knows how to add other elements and taking them into what Star Wars means. The combat, while simple, has a lot of freedom build into it, and the platforming-backtracking is excellent. Whenever you are a Star Wars fan or not, this is a game that you should consider getting.If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/";Recommended;13.1;26/11/2019;954;49;;10.0
192;EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Action, Adventure;R$ 199,00;"Jedi Fallen Order is, by quite a big margin, the most surprising title of the year for me, not only compared to the expectations I had for it, which were admittedly pretty low, but for how genuinely brilliant this game achieves to be.It's true, Fallen Order really looks like a greatest hits of all the major and most appreciated mechanics we've seen in single player videogames in the last few years: we have bombastic cinematic moments took straight from the Uncharted series (if you played Uncharted 2, you'll probably find the first hour of the game to be hilarious, in that sense), tombs with puzzles to solve and walls to jump onto that seem borrowed from the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy, a combat system very similar to what we recently saw in Sekiro by From Software but, thankfully, they never end up falling in the ""been there, done that"" zone and they always feel extremely polished and cohesively combined, returning us a fantastic experience that is far more than the sum of its parts. The level design by Respawn is also top notch, with an intricate map design that is both a joy to explore in every corner the first time, in order to find secrets and hidden optional enemies, and fun to return to once you unlocked those abilities you were missing and that you can now use to reach places you couldn't get to before. The difficulty is well balanced and, at the hardest setting, it gives you a nice challenge without resulting too frustrating: this is definitely the difficulty to pick if you're experienced with action games like Sekiro. The story is coherent and serviceable, enriched by a cast of interesting characters you'll most likely want to know more about (sadly our main guy isn't one of them, that is the one thing that never changed from my initial impressions). On the technical side the game is also very solid, with great graphics and an extremely polished PC port. the only issues I encountered during my playthrough were all due to the integration with Origin, which is something they really can't drop soon enough. All things considered, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a brilliant game that everyone should at least consider playing, even if they're not particularly interested in the Star Wars universe (I'm not a massive fan of the saga myself). Great job, Respawn!";Recommended;25.9;6/12/2019;479;28;;10.0

They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.I bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!Every single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??It's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!;Not Recommended;587.4;4/08/2021;2,192;72;;2.0
200;EA (Electronic Arts);Battlefield 5;Action;R$ 229,00;"Plagued by hackers, almost no oceania community, devs don't care, hackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still haven't been banned. Lazy.Edit: Wow this review got a lot more publicity than I expected! That being said, now that I've played a bit more I'd like to revise my initial thoughts. Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good game, the bullet ballistics are good, team work and strategy is good, the graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good. But all this is over-arched by critical flaws that I'm guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasn't likely to be as profitable as they were expecting. Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency. Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few ""specializations"" for each weapon, mostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things. The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers. They obviously knew their time wouldn't make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best. There's a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement. It's been abandoned, players don't get banned, reports don't get answered. If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield series, there's definetly fun to be had but heres a few tips:* Avoid official servers: that's right, the official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers. EA you should be ashamed.* Consider avoiding if you live in a remote area: In Australia today I was able to find just 1 conquest server with 40 players and able to at least play the game (10AM on a Wednesday). I really can't guarantee that there will be any player base if you live somewhere more exotic than Australia, USA and Europe are probably okay. Don't count on being able to find a server if you're a night owl like me.Overall this game had a lot of potential but it stands as a hollow shell of what it could have been. I liked the inclusion of female characters and being able to play as someone who I felt more of a connection to but the amount of hostility EA showed towards their player base was uncalled for and instead of making up for it they took the money and ran.";Not Recommended;54.0;29/06/2020;1,113;55;;4.0

During the main game, read the character biographies in the Archives (found in the in-game menu). It sometimes explains things that happened off-screen, and is updated when significant events happen in the game.I will now explain in detail why I recommend the order above. Each of the following numbered points corresponds to the same numbered point above:1. If you're undecided about whether you should buy the game, the Demo gives you all of Chapter 1, which is a good opportunity for you to try the game's mechanics and decide if they are to your taste (especially the combat). If you've already bought the game, Chapter 1 is for you to get to know the main cast as they are ""now"". The supplementary material (the Brotherhood anime and the Prologue novella) will delve into their backstories a bit more. This means of course that the supplementary material actually takes place before Chapter 1, but I recommend playing Chapter 1 first - kind of like how in real life you meet people and get to know them as they are, and then once you've known them for a while, then you start to learn more about their past and their history2. This takes place before Chapter 1 and ends some time after Chapter 1. Noctis and his buddies are barely in the movie, but the movie sets up the world and lore - why Noctis and his buddies are doing what they're doing at the start of Chapter 1, and what's going on in their home city Insomnia while they're away. Pay attention to King Regis' motivations (try to empathize with him). In the movie's prologue, the white-haired boy is Ravus (he'll show up in the 2nd half of the game) and the girl is Lunafreya (Noctis' bride-to-be). If you can form an emotional connection with Lunafreya over the course of the movie, it will improve the emotional stakes of the game. The movie focuses on Nyx's point of view, but really the people you want to pay attention to (for the game's sake) is King Regis and Lunafreya. Also side note: Clarus (the shaven-head guy who's with King Regis) is Gladiolus' dad3. The real plot of the game starts here. At the start of the chapter you seek out Cor from the Crownsguard. Note that the Crownsguard is different from the Kingsglaive featured in the Kingsglaive movie. I initially confused this character with the leader of the Kingsglaive in the movie until I googled it4. The anime's ""present"" takes place while you're on your road trip around doing the tasks that you're told to do in Chapter 2, so this is a good time to watch it. The backstory of what happened to Noctis is a good way for you to understand why  Noctis is so broody. It's easier to empathize with him once you know the trauma he experienced as a child. Also, the little girl Iris in Episode 3 is Gladiolus' little sister and she shows up in the game.5. This takes place the day before Noctis and friends eave Insomnia to embark on their roadtrip. It ends right as they're going to the Citadel to meet King Regis (the opening scene of the game). I liked how it developed Noctis and Ignis' relationship a bit more, especially when Ignis recalls how Noctis' injury changed him. I presume this is the injury from the daemon in the Brotherhood anime. I believe that same injury is the one Noctis was still recovering from in the prologue of the Kingsglaive movie. This might help you understand Lunafreya's special place in Noctis' heart. At just 8 years old Noctis witnessed the death of his caretaker at the hands of a daemon and is himself injured. Presumably he is still recovering from this injury when he meets Lunafreya as a child in Tenebrae, which Noctis constantly has flashbacks to in the game. To meet someone so pure and loving like Lunafreya not long after his dark, traumatic experience with the daemon must have left a strong impression on him, building a strong emotional attachment for him to Lunafreya.6. Have fun. You might have heard that the sidequests are really unabashedly bad and of no consequence to the world/plot (unlike games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3). It's quite a shame because it's a such a missed opportunity, given how beautiful the Open World is to roam about in. SquareEnix probably just ran out of time or resources, and admittedly churning out well-written side-quests is probably the least of the concerns given the long development hell the game went through. Nevertheless, just take the sidequests and hunts as excuses for you to spend time with Noctis and his buddies. The more you develop an attachment to the 4 of them, the better the emotional payoff towards the end of the game and in the DLC.7. This DLC is about Gladiolus trying to get stronger so he can better protect Noctis. Not really much story development, but the combat is more skill-based and probably an interesting experiment on SquareEnix's part. If you like Gladioulus' combat style, you can unlock the ability to play him in the main game by spending AP in the main game's Ascension menu (it's under the Techniques tab). You can do this even before you play the DLC actually, but the DLC trains you better. If you finish the DLC it unlocks a new weapon (both Gladiolus and Noctis can use it) and ability for Gladiolus that carries over to the main game.8. The Open World is about to close off lore-wise soon. You can still play the Open World segment in the later chapters, but it's not lore-friendly because Noctis and his buddies are about to embark on a journey that leaves behind the Open World. You access the Open World through pretty much a game mechanic later on. I spent over 70 hours on the Open World before I finally moved on in Chapter 9. Think of it as time for you to develop your love for the main characters. The emotional impact of the linear Chapters 9-14 depend on this9. (See previous point)10. Enjoy the story!11.

Hairworks is the most lightweight one though (costs about 2fps) and looks amazing so I kept that one on.2) The High-Resolution Pack works great on a GTX 1070 (on 1440p res), even though it lists minimum requirements as being a GTX 1080 Ti, and I recommend you get it if you run a resolution greater than 1080p, have a GPU with 8GBs of VRAM, and have the extra 65GBs of space for it.3) If you have performance issues remember to update your drivers. Both Nvidia and AMD have new drivers that include optimization for this game.4) IMPORTANT EDIT: I originally had a guide here on how to edit the .ini file to support a 144hz monitor. After playing a little longer I noticed some bugs I was having such as long black screens before loading and hunt posters staying on screen after turning the quests in. Turns out this was due to editing the .ini file. Please reset your .ini file if you are having issues after editing it from my guide or another. Edits other than framerate can cause similar issues too. I recommend leaving the file alone for now.5) The options you get when booting up the game ""Television"" or ""Home Theater"" don't affect your display, they actually affect your audio. It also had nothing to do with stereo or surround sound. It determines audio compression. If you are using low quality speakers select ""Television"" as it will sound better for you. Otherwise choose ""Home Theater"".Note: I know many are reporting random CTDs or frame drops but I haven't experienced a single CTD and the game runs smooth as butter for me staying between 50-60 fps even when encountering large enemies (i7-4790k, GTX 1070, 16GB 2133 DDR3 RAM, SSD).Game Review:PC Support - 9/10Performance - 9/10Graphics - 9/10Sound - 8/10Music - 8/10Story - 9/10Gameplay - 7/10Multiplayer - 4/10 (mostly dead by the time I got to it)Things I like:Story was great and the main crew are some of the most unforgettable characters in gaming.The setting is a mix of high fantasy and steampunk but where some characters just look like normal people driving cars and stuff.The summons and giant creatures you sometimes encounter are epic. Imagine fighting a boss the size of a mountain... so big the camera doesn't even function correctly.You're driving a luxury vehicle that transforms several times throughout the game.Whole game is very stylish.Things I don't like:The story won't hit like it should unless you experience the other accompanying FFXV media first such as Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV and Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV. While not as important it might even be worth it to play A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV and watch the Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV on YouTube.Episode Ardyn isn't included in this edition and it's the best DLC content.Side quests are some of the most boring unmemorable side content I've played through, reminds me of MMO fetch quests with no real story involved. I recommend skipping them even if you are a completionist.The high level challenge dungeons are just seemingly endless copy and paste floors of enemies, don't bother with these either.Unlike others I don't have a problem with the combat, I have a problem with the difficulty. The game is way too easy since you can just buy and carry ridiculous amounts of healing items. I later found out there is an easy mode but not hard mode which is just absurd. Definitely play with the hard mode mod from the Nexus even if it's your first time playing.The brainless minigame ""Justice Monsters Five"" is way too easy and therefore way too long and boring however if you play it long enough you can get some great items from it at the beginning of the game.";Recommended;132.0;7/03/2018;509;11;;9.0

214;Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;RPG;FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION PLAYABLE DEMO;"Spoiler-free review:[DISCLAIMER]I do vaguely critique on the story's development. If you wish to dive into the game without knowing any sort of pacing-related topics in terms of the game's story, do not read ahead. or just skip the next paragraph. However, I do not give out any specific spoilers, so rest assure.[STORY]Now, after beating the main story for myself, I will say one very important thing about the pacing of the story: the chapters feel very rushed toward the end, and it felt like each few sections of chapters within the game were developed, or written, by different people, Not to mention the numerous plot holes that were in each chapter, especially towards the end of the game. It goes from semi-dynamic gameplay to dynamic, and then to linear, which is absolutely disappointing. During the dynamic portion of the game, you can start and finish many side-quests, dungeons, or just power level via fighting monsters and bosses. Then, when you decide to progress through the story, about three-fourths of the way through progression, the game just decides to throw you into a linear structure of gameplay, which you will notice after about five minutes of playing through it. To conclude the topic of the game's story, let me say that it started it out pretty well, then escalated into something worse, but manageable if you don't think too critically about the plot holes, or why they developers decided to do what they did.Nonetheless, I still loved the characters, especially the main four and their small interactions during the open-world sequences.[DLC]So, at long last, I have finished all three DLC's. My experiences with Episode Gladiolus and Prompto differ from Episode Ignis. I didn't dislike any of the DLC's. however, I thoroughly enjoyed Episode Ignis a lot more not just because of the better combat mechanics, but because the story from the full-game is actually redeemed in a way through playing this DLC. The way they handled this DLC was pretty genius, and if you play through it, you might think the same. I can't say why exactly without giving out spoilers, so I'll stop talking about Ep. Ignis here. Each time the three DLC's were released, they got better and better. Episode Glad was a bit weak in terms of content, but explained what happened during a certain part of the main-game's story. Episode Prompto was very good in developing Prompto's character, but was weak in gameplay. There were moments during combat where I was getting a bit frustrated with how weak I was against the enemies. The mechanics were cool, but it felt like I was playing a third-person shooter made by Ubisoft.My overall thoughts on all three DLC's: They were very good in terms of story and character development. some could use tweaking in gameplay mechanics. and beating each DLC can give you extra items/weapons/fashion in the main game which is a plus. Although they felt weak at times, I liked all three of the DLC's. I believe they added onto the main game's story plot points quite a bit, which makes them more than worth playing.[GAMEPLAY]{Played this game with a Playstation 3 controller}I will try to keep this short and start off by saying that the gameplay is amazing! No, the combat is not turn-based, although you can enable the ""Wait"" combat function in the options at any time, which gives you a slight feel of the combat being turn-based. I decided to play without it, and I had a blast. My only gripe about the combat is that you can't freely use magic. You have to create it by absorbing three types of elements: electricity, fire, and ice. With these three, you can create a spell, which usually comes in a stock of x3 or x4. Furthermore, you can add a fourth item from your inventory which gives the spell more potency and effects. It's not so bad once you get used to it, but I still do wish you can use White Magick or Black Magick like in the older games. [VISUALS]Another disclaimer: This is a budget gaming PC I created in 2015. so yes, it is on the low-mid end tier. CPU: Intel i5-3570k (3.4ghz, NOT OC'd)GPU: Gigabyte GTX 960 2GBRAM: 8 GB DDR3DISK: Game installed on Samsung 850 EVO SSD 250 GBOS: Windows 7 64-BitOkay, so after testing various graphics settings via playing the demo before the full-game release, I ended up playing the majority of the full-game in the ""High"" setting with the scaling set to 100%. As many of you would expect with my specs, I did end up with a few problems here and there. After beating certain parts of the main story, I would end up running into a cutscene with about 10-20 frames running, even after the cutscene ended. So, I would be playing at the said frames unless I restarted my game. The same problem would sometimes happen after I perform a summon. Because of this, towards the end of the game, I switched to the ""Average"" graphics setting and I was mostly fine from there. There was one immersion-breaking moment that happened in a certain cutscene during the final hour or two of the game, where Noctis was invisible, but it was a rather short and less-important cutscene, so I was okay with it.On the ""Average"" settings, I was getting about 45-60 frames with a few dips here and there, but I did end up beating the game without the frames ever being locked to 30. So here's a tip from me: play this game with a graphics card with more VRAM than me. or just have a better machine than mine, which I'm sure is the case for many of you. I just thought I would add this section for the few that have rigs similar to mine. Final note, don't enable the last four ""NVIDIA"" graphics settings because those destroy your frames, even if you have an a slightly better setup than mine.[LOADING SCREENS]Okay. So, If you've played this game on a console after the initial release in 2016, you know how excruciatingly long the loading screens were. If you install this game on a standard HDD, you will get the same effects. However, if you install on an SSD, the longest you will have to wait is about 30 seconds. The average time it took for me to sit through the load screens was about 3 to 15 seconds. That's it.So try to install on an SSD if you have one. I moved a few of my steam games over to my 4TB HDD, just to install this and it was worth it. [As of 03/10/2018] On my end, this game is about 83.3 GB's, so maybe use that as reference to find some space.[VOICE ACTING]I don't mean to start a war over ""Sub vs. Dub"". I appreciate both languages.As a Japanese-American who fluently speaks and comprehends both the English and Japanese language, I played the entire game in Japanese, with English subtitles. Thank you Square Enix for adding that function to almost all of your newer games! I have watched a few Twitch streamers and YouTubers play the game in English, and I have to say both are very good. However, there were very key differences in the acting. Once again, let me state that I am not being biased because I'm Japanese. I believe I have a pretty good understanding of the level voice acting displayed on both sides of the spectrum. Now, my thoughts are that some of the characters' voices in English are a bit jarring at times. Since writing some of my specific critiques on the voices would end up riling some of you, I will avoid in doing so. However, I will say that the Japanese voices fit perfectly, and I had no problems at all.It was interesting, though, to hear Cindy talk in Japanese. In English, she has that southern accent, but in Japanese, she just speaks using standard Tokyo dialect. No complaints though. Also, the localization of this game made it so the subtitles are following the English voices, not Japanese. So if you play with Japanese voices, know that not all dialogue is the literal translations. Steam's character limit is preventing me from so much more explanation, unfortunately.

On one hand, it is such a flawed game. flawed in its core fundamentals - empty open world, middling and slightly repetitive side quests, weak narrative structure (can i just say, i adore the FFXV lore? why is it not in the game???). but somehow, all these things become bearable because i have the company of 3 extremely lovable, adorable, and memorable companions/party members. i will slog through endless walking in a barren field to kill 5 enemies because i want to hear noctis mistake prompto for ignis during their linkstrikes. i'll drive (also known as the most boring way to traverse an open world i've ever known) just to do prompto's lil photo spot side quests. i'll cook in campsites so gladio can have his cup noodles.

216;Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;RPG;FINAL FANTASY XV WINDOWS EDITION PLAYABLE DEMO;This is a tragic game.  There are signs that this was supposed to be the greatest game ever.  If I showed you cutscenes and gameplay, you'd think they look spectacular.If I described armigar, warp strikes, chain strikes, etc, you'd think it sounded intense.If I told you the bullet points of the story, you would think it sounded intriguing.  It was going to gather together numerous elements of the entire final fantasy series into one complete and spectacular legend.Something went wrong, maybe it didn't get finished.  Pieces got sewed together.  There is no flow, no pace, no bridging any of it together.  Massive plot points are simply mentioned.  Gameplay gets tiresome as you just wail on enemies and getting higher powered just means it takes 20 seconds to kill a bad guy instead of 40.  It's fine for RPG combat, but it's not fun enough to carry exploration and other content.  Speaking of which, optional content is the worst part.  HOURS and hours of this game can be described as fetch quest 1-10, picture quest 1-10, animal gathering 1-10, Hunt monsters for gil etc.  Minimal dialogue, no development, and no point except money and wasting time and making you wonder what you are doing with your life.  You need an RPG to have character development, interesting plot, interesting themes, suprises, warmth and heart.  The sidequests are empty and frustrating.  It's probably wise to leave them when you have had enough.  However, every once in a while during the main story you are whisked away for a few moments and forget how bad it was for the hours wasted in between cutscenes.  Sometimes it feels totally worth it.  Some additional thoughts:  I watched Kingsglaive and the brotherhood miniseries before playing, and they went a long way to helping me enjoy the game.  Watching them all before playing any of the game wasn't confusing.   Playing the game in english means that your buddies will say dorky things, maybe playing in japanese can insulate you from that (assuming you can't tell the difference between dorky and cool japanese) The game in its current form is about a C+, I'm glad I played it.

219;Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;All in all, this is a good game and worth playing. I was a bit skeptic, due to the mixed reviews (especially some people were still negative even by getting it in sale at 15€). I must say, at 15€ it's absolutely a bargain even with its flaws.Mankind Divided continues the story of human revolution, so i don't understand how some negative reviews bash this aspect of the game. It's a sequel, what did you expect?Some people hate the fact that there isn't a real tie-in to the choices taken in human revolution, in fact, you don't need a savegame. Did you save somebody? Did you pick a certain ending? It doesn't matter, the game will recap the first chapter and skip all these customization through careful dialogs and skilled story telling. It's a bit annoying, i can agree, but really, not that big deal like somebody tells.This game has a huge problem for many people: it's not human revolution. HR set the bar very high (especially considering the franchise. Do you remember the time when deus ex 1 was the only good deus ex?) and beating that was going to be a challenge: some people will never be happy.The game has a few flaws, and, in my opinion, are all cause of possible budget cuts or crunch time. Often you see a lack of variety (for example the underground loading screens) which should not be present in AAA games as this one. Do they break immersion? A little. Are they game breaking? Absolutely not. It is true, in order to shove a lot of content in the game (with side missions) many things are sospiciously convenient. Need to do side mission X? What a coincidence, it's just 20 meters over there, just the apartment in front side mission Y.Yet, the story is not bad (although take a few hours to get you engaged) and although i didn't like --- MINOR SPOILER AHEAD ---- the fact that it leaves the door open for a new chapter -------- END OF MINOR SPOIELR ----  i overall had fun.The final mission especially is my favourite part of the game even if it's probably a little too short.Some other minor annoying stuff are there, but really, it's still a very good game.

It improves upon Human Revolution in nearly every way, and I laud Edios for the amount of work and effort that went into this game, however it is clear that Square Enix cut this title into pieces to sell as DLC and future Deus Ex games and as a testing bed for the atrocious microtransactions. I had heard that Mankind Divided's main story ended quite abruptly, but when the New Game+ notification appeared and the credits began rolling I was in disbelief. I bought this game on the expectation that I was going to experience a complete story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Mankind Divided is only the beginning. It is frustrating, because everything about Mankind Divided is amazing. The fusion of classical European and post modern architecture is beautiful and this world is a distinct cyberpunk that stands alone from the masses of Blade Runner inspired worlds. The combat and stealth are a massive improvement over Human Revolution, and the level design is top notch all across the board. The story (main and side quests) and its themes, despite being a bit heavy handed and not thoroughly fleshed out, have so much potential in addition to the characters that inhabit them.

222;Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;"You're probably wondering why I'm ""Not recommending"" a game that I've invested literally 5 days of my life into. For one, because Steam doesn't have a ""meh"" option. but mainly, because compared to its predecessor Human Revolution, this game isn't really that good.Let's rewind to 2011, when HR was released. As a reboot of a much-loved series, it pretty much did everything right: great characters that you actually cared about, overarching plot that built to a very satisfying crescendo, and of course game mechanics that could suit anyone from the stealthiest hacker to the most gung-ho gunslinger. Yes, there were some rough edges, but they were easily forgivable given the scope and breadth of Eidos Montreal's accomplishment.Given all that, the most burning question on my mind is: how the hell did it then take them half a decade to release what is essentially an expansion to HR? And I use the word expansion deliberately, because overall Mankind Divided feels like less of a game than its older sibling.This is due to a lot of things. Firstly, and most importantly, instead of there being multiple cities between missions, there's one hub - Prague - that you return to repeatedly. Now, Prague definitely changes and evolves between each mission, but it doesn't really grow. you can visit almost the entirety of it right from the beginning of the game, which means that coming back to it time and time again becomes pretty boring.That isn't helped by the fact that Prague is just plain small. there are maybe a dozen streets with about the same number of side alleys. In terms of footprint it's probably larger than HR's Detroit and Hengsha combined, but those cities were redeemed by the fact that they had more going on on roofs and multi-storey apartment blocks than they did at street level. Prague has sewers, street level, a few empty apartments higher up and... that's it.The ridiculous load times, which were marginally acceptable in HR in 2011 but are actually offensive in MD in 2016, make this seem even worse because getting around becomes a chore. If Bethesda can ship Skyrim and Fallout 4 with multi-kilometre-square maps that have no loading times (apart from fast travel), then I fail to see why MD can't have a single seamless map for the maybe 1 square kilometre that makes up Prague. You literally have to endure a loading screen to get from one small half of Prague to the other... what? Why?Hey, did you like the characters in HR? Too bad, because you ain't gonna see them in this game! Sarif makes three video cameos, assuming you do the side mission involving him. Pritchard? Referenced a couple of times. Malik? Referenced once, extremely indirectly. Taggart? Referenced once (yeah, he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but still a well-portrayed one).What we have in their place are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes that exist for no other reason than to push the plot along. You have the hacker lady who literally does nothing, the gruff leader who doesn't like it when you go off script, his second-in-command who doesn't like you, and the pilot who also doesn't like you. None of them are particularly likeable or memorable, most just get on your nerves, and talking to them really doesn't affect or alter the outcome of the game in any way. Terrible lipsyncing doesn't help to endear them either.And then there's the villains - or should I say, villain. HR didn't do too well on this front, but at least it had more than one Big Bad and by extension, more than a single boss fight. MD has quite literally one boss fight, right at the end of the game, and you know exactly who it's going to be against BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY ONLY ONE CHARACTER IT CAN BE - a character you meet halfway through the game. Who is so laughably obviously the Big Bad, that all the contortions the game pulls to try to make you second-guess and think it's someone else are just cringeworthy.""Cringeworthy"" is a pretty good description of the plot, actually. This being a Deus Ex game, one would expect a meandering plot with a few dead ends, and while HR delivered, MD plays it pretty much straight. I don't have an issue with straight plots, even in a Deus Ex game - as long as they're played honest. MD doesn't do that. instead of owning its join-the-dots plot and trying to play to its strengths, it tries to obfuscate and hide that simplicity under layers and layers of unnecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and poorly-executed misdirection, and the end result is that it just ends up feeling needlessly annoying and forced.As for gameplay, it's HR with the rough edges mostly polished. Takedowns are easier to execute and stealthier in that Jensen actually (gasp!) attempts to hide his victims as part of the takedown animation. However, dragging unconscious enemies, or corpses, to hiding spots is just as irritating as HR, in that sometimes the dragging just stops for no apparent reason, or a limb gets stuck on something and you have to go around and pull from a different angle. And no, you still can't just PICK UP AND CARRY bodies, which would obviate this whole mess.Combat: just like everything else in MD, the selection of weapons is similar to HR, but lesser. On the plus side you now have the option to upgrade weapons with crafting parts that can be found and bought. on the downside, some of the most powerful weapons are no longer available. Presumably this is to encourage players to rely more on the new augmentations, but Deus Ex as a series has always been about choice, and MD takes away rather than giveth. Also, no Boxguards. :'(The new augs are pretty cool, although you can't really play with them until later in the game due to another arbitrary plot speedbump. The Remote Hacking aug in particular is probably my favourite (in fact I'd say it's almost essential), but again, it feels like something that could've and should've been in HR. There are a lot more lethal augs to complement the Typhoon, which itself is now available in a non-lethal option, and they make it possible to finish the game without using any handheld weapons, which is nice I guess.Oh, and then there's Breach mode, which is now free sooo... doesn't really contribute to my overall sentiment towards MD. It does add some unique new mechanics and looks pretty cool in a Tron-like way, but again... free. Also microtransactions.Finally, this game has some serious bugs - be careful with the inventory screen because often, attempting to customise a weapon from it causes the game to crash to desktop. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why this happens, and often attempting to customise the same weapon that caused the crash before, causes another crash - the only fix is to drop that weapon from your inventory and pick it up again. Then there's the black screen issue, whereby a single pixel goes black, then the pixels around it, then all the pixels around them... etc. until the entire screen is black and the game crashes the display driver. The ""fix"" is to switch your Smart Vision augment on and then off again - but good luck doing that if you're stuck in dialog or a hacking minigame. Maybe it's only a problem with NVIDIA hardware, but it's piss poor whatever way you look at it. (Yes, I have the latest patch. No, it's not overclocking or corrupted drivers.)To conclude: on its own, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is a good game, especially if you enjoy stealth. Unfortunately its predecessor Human Revolution is a great game, which makes it difficult to recommend this one unless you're a HR veteran looking for more of the same. If you're looking to start with the Deus Ex series, HR is better and cheaper. play that first before deciding whether you want to buy this.And seriously, Square Enix? You want me to purchase mission DLC that probably should've been part of the full game? As if the microtransactions and single-use items weren't enough?

223;Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;"MASSIVE LET DOWN Ok, so I pre-ordered DXMD and completed it on ""Give Me Deus Ex"" level along with all side missions within just 2 days of release. After I completed it I uninstalled it and didn't bother writing a review as they were already negative and explaned the issues fully. I really wanted to enjoy this game, as I have had great fun in Human Revoulution and for most of my playthrough I was having fun. However this game ended up being a great let down to me and I'll tell you why... Pros: + Beautiful Visuals & effects+ Smooth/fluid gameplay & controls+ Great ambient theme & soundtrack+ Immersive environment+ Good sound design (apart from gun sounds)From the above you are probably wondering why this is getting a bad review, but the thing is this game lacks severly in major areas. I want to get this one off my chest quickly. Deus Ex games have always had multiple ""hubs"", where you can roam around environments freely, exploring, recieving quests and buying items. However DXMD only has 1 hub, which ruins the global travel theme shown in the games before it.... and ooohhhh boy the worst part about this game is the embarrasing lack of content. I don't blame the developers at all, it seems like Square Enix had just cut large amounts out of the game to pump out later as dlc. This games story was great for the first 5 hours of gameplay, however it turned to litteral ♥♥♥♥ afterwards. I have seen Call Of Duty pull off better stories than this, honestly it is less than half the length of the story in DXHR and it certainly wasn't quality over quantity. One thing they advertised and hyped up, was the supposedly ""important"" decision making, but it ended up being almost non-existent. Instead of your choices being reflected in gameplay, it only changes what is shown on Picus News near the end of the game. THE ENDING IS LITERALLY YOUR CHOICES IN THE STORY BEING READ BACK TO YOU BY PICUS NEWS , no joke it has to be the worst ending they could have possibly come up with lmao. I cannot recommend this game at full price, maybe if it's under £10 you should buy, infact I would wait for a directors cut version where they give you the content they took in the first place. A massive let down to DX fans, everyone would prefer Human Revolution, buy that instead if you get the chance.I'm also worried people will be fooled into buying this game as they keep dropping prices for the main game & DLCs.

227;Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;"It's an almost surreal experience to be writing a negative review for a Deus Ex game, after having invested countless hours in the series and enjoying them immensely (The Fall notwithstanding), but here we are. I will try to keep this short and sweet.The game is awesome, the trademark Deus Ex feeling of having many possible pathways to solving a problem is there, the character customization is there, the great worldbuilding and lore is there (including references and callbacks to the series as whole), the excellent characters are there, and the gameplay itself is very similar to the one of Human Revolution (Which was top notch), and even improved in some areas. In short, the game is a treat and if you liked Human Revolution, you will certainly love Mankind Divided.Now you will be thinking ""But what is the problem? How come the game is reviewed negatively if it has so much going for it?""The fatal flaw lies in the story. Not even the quality of the story itself, but that the game is clearly cut in half, in what has to be one of the worst cases of executive meddling I have ever seen, because I refuse to believe this is how it was intended from the beginning. The ending is a coitus interruptus in game form.To put it more graphical terms (Spoilers for DX: HR coming), imagine you are playing Human Revolution, and after killing Barret, you are shown a cinematic of Adam talking to Sarif about him going to Hengsha to continue his investigation, and then the credits start to roll (30 minutes of unskippable credits, mind you, just to rub more salt in the wound).And to add further insult to injury, two of the secondary missions in Detroit are sold as a separate DLC (Which clearly seems they were ripped from the main content), plus an extra hyper bland game mode topped off with microtransactions and lootboxes. Completely disgusting.Deus Ex is a franchise that has a very dear place in my heart and while I certainly enjoyed the story and would like to know how it continues, I cannot abide these despicable commercial practices.

229;Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;Shadow of the Tomb Raider Free Trial;"Well, here I am, just finished the game.I'll be honest with you, I was really looking forward to this game, and whilst I did most certainly enjoy it, im still disappointed. Im going to start this review with the negatives, and end on a more happy note.Though the game length isn't short, took me about 20 hours to complete around 75%, it still feels a lot shorter than Rise of the Tomb Raider. I can't really explain why, but I found myself quite suprised as to how fast the story was progressing.Speaking of the story, I hate to say it, but it's really quite bad. All the characters are pretty much bland and without any character or personality (with the exception of Lara and Jonah). I guarantee you you won't care about anyone else. Also the story just really lacks depth, I didnt get invested in it, at any point.Then we get to another really weird issue. The dialogue. Whilst the quality of the audio is excellent, I can't help but notice quest givers pause a lot longer inbetween sentences than what I would declare a normal way of speaking. It get's really bad when you are sitting at camp when Lara is narrating, sometimes she pauses like 5 seconds before saying anything. Literally half the time I think shes done talking and then suddenly theres more. It's just weird and feels unnatural.Then we get to the gameplay, first of all, I find there to be a lack of enemies. Sure you do fight quite regularly, whether it's stealth or combat, but, I just ended the game feeling like I hadn't really done much in the way of combat. In the trailers you see this cool scene in a dark jungle where Lara is taking out some soldiers, whilst this is in the game, its literally one quick sequence where you have no weapons, just a knife. There is stealth in the rest of the game of course, but I was hoping there were more areas like the one I just mentioned, instead of one litte sequence. Then we get to the ""hubs"". Do you feel like talking to everyone? I most certainly didn't because of the bad story, so good luck with that. I literally walked past most random civilian dialogue people simply muttering the phrase ""I dont give a sh*t"". Sure it gives you information about secrets and possible tomb locations, but as I said, I just didnt care.Then theres another issue: You will be locked from selecting certain outfits and using certain weapons for a big portion of the game. Now don't get me wrong, I understand the reasoning behind this, it's to ""blend in"", but I just found it really , really annoying. To end on a more positive note:The tombs are excellent.The new climbing mechanics work wellThe graphics are amazing.Excellent voice acting for Lara and JonahStealth is just as good as it was, though really easy due to bad AI.To sum up, if you liked Rise of the Tomb Raider, you will like this, BUT, you will feel it is inferior.I do recommend this game, but I would wait for a sale, especially if you loved Rise of the Tomb Raider.Seeing as though this is the last game in the trilogy, I do want it said that I really do hope they make more of these games, they are a joy to play.";Recommended;48.2;19/09/2018;438;8;;5.0

231;Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;Shadow of the Tomb Raider Free Trial;"MY REVIEW OF THE SHADOW OF THE TOMB RAIDER GAME  In South America  The most significant difference that always characterised each Tomb Raider episode: the change of location. My preference is with the colder climate (this also means that this episode omits the Endurance mode) but it is always nice to see how a new location can affect gameplay. Areas with battle now allow Lara to go back into hiding by bathing in mud. An interesting concept - I particularly liked how she could move along the wall out of plain sight due to the overgrown flora.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NN7UCIAHsQ&t=17s  Trinity  The bad guys return and Lara now encounters a leader called Pedro Dominguez. It is nice to add a face to Trinity this time and Pedro actually knows more of Lara than she thinks. Cutscenes are amazing with the usual high-quality voice acting on everybody's part and there is increased focus on Lara's childhood and father this time. There are a couple of twists here an there - as usual later on a new form of enemy appears to make the story more exciting. This alone does not make the plot totally different so the creators decided to include more peril by choosing artifacts with great power. Let's just say that Lara's race against Trinity has time factored in.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwljTbmEjvw&t=4s  Gameplay  You know how the developers add new elements even when it is not necessary. Gameplay in the previous two instalments was fast and dynamic enough. Still, there's new gear, of course. Overhang climbing is now possible with the use of special boots. I think this feature was unnecessary and thank god no puzzles were based on this. Grappling down from cliffs, however, is a nice new addition. We find all sorts of materials - beside upgrading our weapons we can craft pieces of clothing. Upper and lower body pieces are available but we can also acquire full body outfits. These add bonuses so getting dressed before a fight we can decide if we intend to aim for a more stealthy approach or go full guns blazing by putting on something that gives Lara health regeneration. And, naturally, we can give Lara the ""old"" look by applying skins from previous games (this is a purely cosmetic choice here).Other than these small changes or additional stuff gameplay mechanics remain the same. I liked the inclusion of air pockets during underwater sequences which made it possible to increase the time spent in such areas. Once again Lara can decipher various monuments (her language skills increase gradually) and there are tons of relics and letters to be found out there. You'll return to previous locations by using the camp system several times just to get that 100% completion.Graphics appear to be enhanced once again. I cannot comment on the latest RTX technology but everything else looked stunning as usual. Two more small adjustments done to walkthroughs: there are difficulty settings we can choose from but they are broken down into various elements we can adjust separately. Additionally, there is a possibility to make immersion better by allowing the NPCs to use their native language instead of English.  Longevity  What else to say about Shadow of Tomb Raider? Another great entry in the series where there are more and much bigger tombs. The DLCs also focus on these extra challenges. The hub area we visit appears to be greater and there are many side missions to complete. It's worth investing time into these as getting the rewards will make Lara stronger. There is a New Game+ mode available with additional skills we can purchase only during this second walkthrough.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdEfROL2Wx8&t=340s  I had fun with the latest instalment. The puzzles were sometimes annoying (oh boy the one in the church was just awful!) but gave me a good challenge, nonetheless. Of all 3 episodes this one has the most interesting story and definitely the most satisfying end game boss battle.";Recommended;219.3;23/06/2022;132;21;;8.0
232;Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;Shadow of the Tomb Raider Free Trial;"TL:DR if you expect a lot of combat from this game, do not buy it. If you want decent puzzles, stealth based action scenes or you are a Tomb Raider fan -old or new- in general, go for it. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is not a perfect game, it has its flaws -to some A LOT of them- but I believe it depends on what you expect from this game. As an old Tomb Raider fan, I expected puzzles that were not solvable in the very first minute, a strong Lara depiction and a little bit of action to add some spice to the game. I got what I wanted, but certainly there are some features I thought that could've been a lot better. - Skill system is pretty much useless in this game. If you played the previous games, you will recognize most of the skills that are present in Shadow. Those skills worked fine in 2013 and Rise because there were a lot of combat moments in them, but in Shadow there aren't a lot of combat. So weapon crafting and upgrading is pretty useless as well. Sometimes you won't even have your weapons other than your bow to fight the enemies anyway, sometimes you are forced to kill enemies only with your knife. -The game had many ads saying that you were going to be in the Amazon jungle this time, dealing with predators and wild life, but there aren't a lot of moments like that either. Only a few jaguars, piranhas and eels and that's pretty much the wild life you're going to witness. I expected more since Amazon was called the Green Hell by the conquistadors.-  It's a bit shorter than the previous games. The story is decent, it's not mind blowing nor lame. There are some moments you can see them coming from a mile away, but I thought it was interesting to deal with Trinity once again. Although I feel Lara has not become THE Lara we know, it's still nice to see her questioning her environment -even if she destroys or takes most of the artifacts she finds in her raidings lol - If you like parkouring, then you will love this game. Especially with the new difficulty settings, you can set the exploration difficulty on whatever suits you. - More swimming. I think this lacked in the previous games, so it was nice to have some underwater areas you can explore, be careful with the piranhas though.- There are more crypts and optional tombs in Shadow, and some of them are GREAT. Most of them have great atmosphere where you truly feel you are in a place that has been hidden and no man has set foot on the ground for a very long time. - I'm not even mentioning the graphics, the game looks pretty neat. It needs a bit more optimization as of October 2nd, but still it's a feast for the eyes.- This may not be important to many, but when I play games that are based on historical facts, then I want them to be researched thoroughly so they will be accurate. Sadly that is not the case here, you are going to see a lot of Mayan symbols in Incan tombs. The story tries to fix this mistake, but it's not doing a very believable job. Even the artifacts you find here and there, they have wrong information written about them. You can say ""this is a game, not a history lesson"" and that's fair ^_^ I just think if you are giving information about a REAL historical object, then at least do it right.Overall, this is an enjoyable game but I would recommend you to wait for a discount.";Recommended;71.6;2/10/2018;276;8;;6.0

234;Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;Shadow of the Tomb Raider Free Trial;First off let me say that while this is a negative review, SOTTR is not a terrible game. It's a well polished AAA that just happens to have enough issues to make it a disappointing end to the reboot trilogy. Steam does not let me rate a game out of 10 and I'm unwilling to give it a thumbs up, so here we are.Let's start with what the game does well. The environmental design in this game is superb. The variation isn't huge because there's no globe hopping in this game (you'll be seeing a lot of jungle,) but the attention to detail and art direction meant I never cared. This is a beautiful game to look at.Eidos Montreal has also done a very good job of porting this to the PC. I read early reviews saying there were some performance issues but a month after release those seem to have been resolved. I'm running and FX6300 and GTX970 with 8GB RAM. It's not a beast of a machine by any means (the CPU is most definitely a bottleneck,) but I was still able to run the game on the 'High' preset at 1080p and achieve a solid 60fps in closed areas and 45fps in open areas and cities. Whilst talking about graphics I also want to mention that the temporal anti-aliasing in this game is top notch, there wasn't a jaggy edge in sight.Moving onto gameplay, this is where things become a bit more mixed. On the good side of things the platforming is as fluid as the previous two games, but more importantly, Eidos have finally managed to get the 'right' amount of actual tomb raiding into the game. Tomb Raider 2013 really suffered for having really poor tombs that felt like little more than small caves with basic physics puzzles. Crystal Dynamics improved this a fair bit in Rise of the Tomb Raider with longer tombs and more complex puzzles (even if the theming of the tombs wasn't always very tomb-like). With Shadow of the Tomb Raider we're finally back to something fans of the pre-reboot games might recognize. Really lengthy tombs with complex multi-stage puzzles. I really can't understate how much better this aspect of the game is compared to the previous two.The problems with the gameplay start to become apparent a few hours in when you realise that you're almost getting too much of a good thing. Whereas the previous reboot games would intersperse sections of tomb raiding and exploration with gun fights, the combat in SOTTR has been seriously reduced. And when I say reduced I mean that other than a couple of dudes near the start, you won't be shooting anything other than guinea pigs and parrots for the first two thirds of the game. I can see why this has happened. the previous two reboot games got flak from some quarters for having too much gun-play. Personally I enjoyed those sections in TR2013 and ROTTR and don't think they had too much shooting, they just had too little tomb raiding. This lack of combat becomes a real problem because it means that the tomb raiding and exploration sections of SOTTR are just too long. What is actually really good gameplay when looked at by itself becomes tedious and repetitive. Something I really should have been enjoying was starting to make me feel bored.Worse than the lack of combat is the fact that what little combat does exist is just not very good. Eidos have introduced some new stealth mechanics and seem hell bent on forcing you to use them. You can now hide in bushes growing up walls which isn't really any different from hiding in bushes on the ground, it's just a new animation. You can also cover yourself in mud to hide from night vision goggles. There are three (I think,) instances in the game where you can use the mud mechanic. The mud patches are placed right at the entrance to a zone, to the point where you can't really progress to the combat without covering yourself in mud. You're given so little agency over this mechanic and it seems to make so little difference to the gameplay that I can't really figure out why they bothered to include it. My only guess is that they had something similar in the advertising cinematic so felt they needed to include it in the game.The enemy AI is clearly tuned towards the player using stealth. If you break cover they have pinpoint accuracy. Not that you will anyway because there are sections of the game where despite actually still having all your weapons (you haven't had them stripped or lost them down a waterfall or anything,) the game will only let you stealth kill with your knife. Unfortunately killing in stealth isn't particularly fun either since the AI is as dumb as a bag of rocks. If you've ever maxed out stealth in Skyrim and had an enemy NPC not see you as you crouch right next to them and the corpse of their buddy, you'll know what I'm talking about. It might seem like I'm talking about the combat in this game a lot but it really is just such a massive step backwards compared to the previous two games.Combat is not the only problem with the gameplay though some of the others are directly related to it. The talent tree for example is lifted almost wholesale from Rise. Ninety percent of those talents are combat related and are therefore useless for most of the game. This really hinders any feeling of character progression. The crafting system likewise suffers since it's focused on upgrading weapons and armour which will rarely be used. The armour sets in the game do at least have some non-combat bonuses which improve yields on foraging and the like. However the main hub of the game will force you to use a disguise costume which has no bonuses at all. Yes, you read that right. You will spend the game earning armour sets which you then can't use for large sections of it.Lastly, lets talk about the story. I'll be brief to avoid spoilers. It's not very good. To be fair, the reboot games have never had the strongest writing but it has always been 'good enough'. TR2013 had the most cohesive narrative since it was almost entirely self contained. Rise expanded on the role of Trinity and offered quite a lot of backstory if you read all the collectable documents. SOTTR has very little set up. You get a McGuffin waved in your face at the start of the game by Trinity and then you won't see it or them again until the final third. The time in between is filled with Lara's introspection on her life and journey so far. It has the potential to really build her character but really just comes across as a bit whiny and self centred. By far the most relatable character is her friend Jonah, almost to the point where I was wishing he was the protagonist.The 'big bad' in SOTTR is the biggest let down. We've had two games building up Trinity as some world spanning illuminati type organisation and yet the 'big bad' feels so loosely connected to them. I think you could probably remove all references to Trinity from the game and it would make no difference to the character of 'big bad'. Considering this is the final instalment in the trilogy it feels like it offers zero closure when it come to the main antagonists of the series.tl.drGOOD:  Graphics  Platforming / exploration  Tombs / puzzles  PerformanceBAD:  Story  Pacing / not enough combat  Enforced stealth, with poor stealth mechanics  Talents, weapons and armour are useless for most of the gameRATING: 6.5 / 10;Not Recommended;56.3;17/10/2018;327;4;;6.0

239;Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Action;R$ 75,95;"It's difficult to review this game without mentioning the RE2 remake, so I won't fight it. Compared to RE2, this game is very disappointing. RE2 started with the original game, built on it, modernized it, and made a definitive version that fits very well with what gamers expect nowadays, whilst still maintaining the spirit of the original.RE3 did the opposite. It wasn't very close to the original at all except for the basic premise. The story was different, the game route was different, MANY areas and bosses were cut (at least a third to half of the original game), and ALL puzzles were cut. The only puzzles present could be solved by a child and they basically give you the solutions anyways. There isn't any survival horror left, it's just a third-person shooter. You get more than enough ammo on Standard difficulty to kill everything in your way.I beat the game in 5 hours - and I was stopping to smell the roses. On top of being extremely short, there is basically no replayability either. Unlike RE2's Tyrant, this game's Nemesis is not dynamic. He shows up at the exact same places every time. In fact, the whole game is completely linear, with everything being the same every time. You can't even play as a different character or do a different route like in RE2. Once you've played it once, all there is to do is use points to buy helpful ""boosts"" in the in-game store, and play the same campaign over again.The visuals, music, sound effects, and characters were all good. Gunplay still feels tight like in RE2, and you will be doing a lot more shooting in this game, so it's good that it holds up. The Hunter Beta is a good reimagining of a classic enemy. The Hunter Gamma is pretty terrible, and defeating it is more a measure of how well you can shoot a flame grenade into its mouth before getting insta-killed than anything else. The Drain Deimos is not at all threatening, except in the VERY distasteful and unnecessary scene where it throat-****s Jill.All in all, the game is mediocre if you get it for $20 CDN / $15 USD. Do not buy it at full price. I have no doubt that the cutting of content and dumbing-down of gameplay was for the sake of finishing the multiplayer component. Nobody asked for that, and RE3 was - and still is - some RE fans' favourite in the whole series. I am very disappointed to see them treat the game this carelessly. They totally wasted the opportunity to remake a great game, most likely so they could push the microtransaction-riddled disaster that is RE: Resistance and make more money. Now there is no way RE3 fans will ever get to play a good remake.RE2 shows how to remake a classic game the right way. RE3 shows how to do it the wrong way.";Not Recommended;8.1;6/12/2020;841;14;;7.0

241;Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Action;R$ 75,95;While RE3 (2020) is a good game, it is a bad sequel to RE2 (2019) and an absolutely terrible remake of RE3: Nemesis. In short, the game lacks in content and replay value compared to both its immediate successor, other games in the franchise, and the original game it is remaking. It is also lacking in the post-launch support that bolstered both RE2 Remake and Resident Evil 7. Capcom has stated they do not plan to support the game further, and so I do not recommend that you purchase this game until it is priced at what it is worth -- no more than $30, and I would suggest even $20. In fact, for the price they are charging as of this review, $39.59 USD on sale you can get most every other game in the series all of which are much better. Go buy and play pretty much any other game in the series, it is much better bang for you buck and also sends Capcom a message that this kind of treatment of unacceptable.UPDATE: Recently Capcom has decided that instead of releasing DLC to fix the lack of content in this game, it would be better to release a DLC that allows you to skip the process of playing the game altogether. Now you can pay money to unlock the small amount of unlockables in the game instead of being bothered to even play the small amount of game that is here.

246;Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Action;R$ 75,95;"As a gamer I recommend it, as a resident evil fan I only feel disappointment :/  This game objectively is good/ ok-ish, but as a remake is really barebones and it lacks in so many ways in comparison with the original and with the remake of resident evil 2. I recommend people to buy it at a heavy discount but this is in no way a complete game, they decided to cut half of the game just to put a multiplayer mode call ""RESISTANCE"" that was already dead a month after release, Capcom keeps trying to make RE multiplayer games  with no idea of what people want, we want coop game, no call of duty or Dying light clones. Please stop, they ended up hurting the campaign just for the sake of it...  The good stuff   This game has good qualities to it, this is by no means a bad game (although it was a rip off at 60 dollars at launch so I didn't buy it at that price) so let's start. The voice acting is superb, specially Jill, I love seeing a ""new game"" with her as a protagonist again, I like her new design but I still like her old one a bit more but it's still great, although is sad to see is such a short game :/. Nemesis design is great too, and how racoon city looks is just breathtaking, gameplay is very similar to RE2 but is a bit faster thanks to Jill's new dodge technique. The game is overall fun and I liked it, there are certain story moments that are great but the more I look at it the cons start to pop up more than the pros sadly.  The bad stuff: The game that it will never be   The remake of this game cuts so many stuff from the original, no clocktower, no park, no exploration, no anticipation, almost no puzzles, no dismemberment system as RE2, and the list can go all day. RE3 remake is extremely linear, the game is filled with scripted moments that makes nemesis to not be a menace at all, in RE2 remake MR.X was a chasing menace made to kill every witness of the racoon city incident, chasing you across the RPD in such unexpected ways and it was terrifying. But in RE3 Nemesis only has 1 real persecutor segment and is stunned with a battery in the most lame way possible, the beast that is meant to kill all the STARS members to avoid spreading the information of the mansion incident, is now just a predictable enemy that doesn't chase you after the first 20 min  of the game.... this is not how is supposed to work and now makes sense why Nemesis is no longer on the title of the game.The overall map of raccoon city is now limited to just 2 streets and like 3 hallways, this is supposed to be the Racoon city game, but the city segment is so short that is really sad, all the locations are there but they are just cameos  and references, so they are closed in one way or another as if it was a fan game instead of a AAA remake like RE2 was, and after this section nemesis won't chase you anymore because they rushed their ""animal"" form so quickly for the sake of action set pieces that is no longer menacing, he just becomes a boss everytime you see him :/. So the rocket launcher nemesis is basically limited to a 2 minute sequence... like why??? that is his signature  weapon and is now just a cameo for 5 seconds because is just a run segment so you don't even see him using it. So, going back to the map, now is just City => Sewers => Hospital => Lab and yeah RE2 only had 3.5 locations but all of them were connected via puzzles but in this one they are shorter, they are not connected, you just see them once.They also completely eliminated the decision making of the original, making this 100% linear in level design and 100% linear in story too. Now you can't choose if you want to explore the city but you can't choose story elements either, so the replayability of this game is non existent. And it sucks because they touched the PTSD of Jill on the beginning of this game but just a little bit, and is such a miss opportunity because if they had included more nightmares and more story choices they could've made a really good exploration of her character, but after the intro she just becomes a bad ass character with no build up :(.  Conclusion   I am negative overall but I actually enjoyed the game, but this game could've been such a masterpiece just as RE2 was, imagining a complete racoon city with interconnected puzzles with nemesis chasing you across all the city as MR.X did , making decisions in the game with multiple endings, giving STARS members more screen time and exploring how umbrella is chasing Jill and how she deals with it thanks to her PTSD and her lack of trust in others.  that is a game I imagined after finishing RE2 remake, and is obvious this game was not made by the same team. This was made by a different team at capcom and it really shows. The RE2 team is working on the RE4 remake so I am excited for that one. That's why I can't recommend it as an RE fan, Capcom gave this game, THE NEMESIS GAME, to a secondary group and took half of their resources to make a trash multiplayer game that was dead a week after release, the lack of time and love put in this proyect is shown if you compare it with RE2 or the original RE3. As a separate thing , yeah is good, is decent. But capcom just chased the easiest and laziest  way to make money, and it sucks this game will always be remembered as the game it will never be :'(.Buy it at a heavy discount, I give it a thumbs down because the average steam score is now at 79% which is undeserved, for me is around the 70s, so I do it to compensate.";Not Recommended;24.1;25/02/2023;360;5;;3.0
247;Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Action;R$ 75,95;"I hate to give this a negative review, and I wont say I didn't have fun with the game, nor saying you wont have fun either. This is just a remake that leaves a bad taste in your mouth no matter if there's bits that are fun in it or not.While your first play through will be magical, even if you played through the original. You'll quickly get a grasp of ""wow this is very short"" even if you stopped to smell the roses the game is very short compared even to the RE2 remake. This is very much because 3 lost a lot of not only its areas from the original, but the more exploration design of them. Progression in 3 is very linear compared even to 2's remake, with the exception of downtown and the hospital (limited) there's almost no free form exploration and rewards there in. Unlike 2's remake you can never return to any of the areas.  While this is in line with the original, you could never area backtrack in the original either, it just compounds the driving you forward to a quick end of the game.If you never played the original, you wont notice the missing areas, you will always notice how short the game is though. For anyone else who knows the original. Its actually almost fascinating how much got cut and or changed, you could almost write an essay about the changes. I will break down a simply as I can what all got cut, changed, or changed to the point it pretty much is cut.Cut/repurposed:UptownUptown is now the games intro and is done in literal minutes compared to being an actual section of the game proper like it was in the original, one upside is we get to see the interior to Jill's apartment for the first time, but it hardly feels like a great trade off.Raccoon/Fox Park:Completely gone from the game, except for a single mention of it on a puzzle. this also means a major boss from the original Gravedigger is gone.RPD:Repurposed as an exclusive area for Carlos, it works well enough and highlights how the story has been changed.Clock Tower:""technically"" in the game, you never go inside it though, you fight a boss just outside it, which the fight would basically be were the same boss fight happens in the original, you just get to skip all the lead up to it.Dead Factory:Repurposed but I am technically going to call this Cut. cause while all the story beats happen. they happen in a place that does not resemble the dead factory at all.Raccoon Hospital:Repurposed, but in one of the few ways that makes it better than its original, since its one of the few places both characters traverse and get some genuine exploration.There's just so much in this that's cut or changed so the game could be stiched together to be a ""complete game"" faster.This feels especially dirty cause of Project REsistance that is packaged with this game, something I still have not touched and probably never will cause its NOT WHAT I WANTED FROM RESIDENT EVIL 3. It honestly feels like they rushed out RE3 so they could have purchase appeal and then ""Please give our 3rd attempt at selling you Operation Raccoon City a try, even though fans have proven time and time again we don't want these MP shoe ins unless its going to be a proper Outbreak remake."" This is very much a sore spot for me because not for the asymetric MP PVP aspect of REsistance it could even be a servicable Outbreak remake, that Capcom wont give us cause there's no money in doing so to them, they want pvp so they can try to sell other crap to pvp mentality. People have even asked if the Mastermind could be set to AI so they could just try to survive with their friends in a more Left 4 dead-eske style, which has fallen on deaf ears thus far.So to summarizeRushed Development: CheckStripped down story mode with cut out sections compared to the original: CheckShoehorned in multiplayer nobody wanted and is used to pad out the game so its ""worth $60"": CheckWait for a giant sale for this one if you ever play it at all.";Not Recommended;23.5;29/06/2020;269;4;;4.0
248;Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Action;R$ 75,95;"First of all let's point out that resident evil 3 remake is in a tough spot, when reading reviews remember that remake will be compared not only to Resident evil 3 original but also to Resident evil 2 remake, Those are two titan size shoes to fill, so don't be so hard on it.In short.Is it a good game? YesIs it a good remake? NoIf you want to know specifically what's wrong with this game, keep reading.I will not complain about action since we have to remember the original RE3 nemesis began with Jill jumping out of an explosion with an M16 and the dodge mechanic was also in the original. So yeah action has always been a part of RE3. Here is a list of everything wrong with this game.1) Cut content: There are lots of removed locations and nearly ALL puzzles from the original that were replaced by nothing, just removed and added nothing in their place. Removing content has a bigger consequence then just enraging the fans. Everything was put there for a reason in the first place, for example, the lockpick in this remake makes absolutely no sense. In the original the lockpick had a function other than it's utility to open doors, it was there to take away one slot from your inventory so most of us would simply leave it in the item box which would be a problem when we ran into a locked door forcing us to keep going back to safe rooms hence doing backtracking. In this remake this doesn't work because when you have all pouches you have twice the amount of slots than the original so you'll never need space. Also since there are so many removed puzzles and key items, your inventory is never full so you never have the need to go looking for an item box....Hell there is even an achievement that consist in finishing the game without opening the item box...why do this? 2) So you loved the return of the ink ribbon in RE2 hardcore difficulty?...Yeah RE3 was like ""lol no"" and they removed it.3) They removed the Grenade/knife button. If the game is more action focused, why remove a button that makes combat faster? to me it is a contradiction, instead of having a grenade button you have to open inventory to equip every time you want to use one(same with knife). Of course this can be fixed by assigning it to a shortcut but you only get 4 so you'll be wasting one on your knife and another on a throwable.4) Pacing is really fast. Don't get me wrong, the original also had a very fast pace, you would get shotgun in the first 10 minutes and magnum or G launcher very soon after that, in this game too. You get guns really fast which is not that bad because strong enemies start appearing really early in the game. My problem is, I'm not even 10 minutes in the game and I already have upgrade attachments for my guns, geez let me at least play around with them a bit before upgrading them.Same can be said about the story you meet your companion very early unlike the original which had you explore the city before meeting the fist survivor, this gave the feeling that the city was destroyed and empty, you never get this feeling of loneliness in this game, you see some NPC citizens running in panic but they are not enough to make it look like a chaotic city and at the same time they are too many to make you feel alone and abandoned, so it ends up somewhere in the middle which is not good.5) The city is too small.This is a big deal, somehow they managed to make raccoon city streets smaller than the original, the first part of the game before clock tower is honestly only like 4 streets and each street has 2 or 3 locations to explore. That's it...which is bad and in my next point I explain why.6) They dropped the ball on NEMESIS!!!!:Such a waste of potential. In the original RE3 nemesis was this harassing presence that appeared whenever you least expected it, kept you always worried about when it was going to show up. Sadly back then they had hardware limits so all the nemesis encounters were scripted. Twenty years later RE2 releases and gives us Mr. X, the character that made everyone's experience different stalking you non stop regardless the difficulty you played, he was a true harasser it seems like it was what they always wanted nemesis to be. So you would assume the NEW NEMESIS will have this chasing  mechanics implemented in RE3  remake right???? WROOOOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All of Nemesis encounters are scripted. Why? I don't know. It's not only that, in the original RE3 Nemesis was way more imposing, by the time you got to clock tower you've had fought him 5 or 6 times, you knew how strong he was and why you should fear him by then, but in the remake you've seen him only 3 times of which one is a mandatory fight and the other two are scenes where you don't even have to fight him but run away, which I must add running away from him is a thrill but in my previous point like I mentioned city is too small for him, you'll run away from him a block or two and chase is over... This is the part of the game that really hurts to see how poorly it was handled, you had the potential , you had open streets and the Mr X mechanics, could have been the perfect playground for Nemesis... and you blew it Capcom...It's still a great game though. I would recommend it, just remember you are comparing it to some of the best titles in the franchise, it doesn't live up to expectations like RE2 did but that doesn't mean it's bad, not being better than the best doesn't make you the worst you know.So yeah definitely recommended when the price drops around 30$.";Recommended;27.1;13/04/2020;326;15;;9.0

256;Capcom;Devil May Cry 5;Action;R$ 268,92;Quick SummaryDevil May Cry 5 (DMC5) is an excellent game that has a very in-depth combat and skills, along with a high skill ceiling. It also sports gorgeous visuals thanks to the RE engine, and various characters that all play differently and keep the whole thing feeling fresh. Environments are varied with hidden secrets, challenges, and alternative routes. The cutscenes are just as high quality as the gameplay itself, with a variety of interesting characters and interesting twists. ProsFantastic graphics and visualsGreat optimizationAn absolute banger of a soundtrack, that fits the game perfectlyHuge variety of enemies and bossesVery in-depth combat system with tons of skills and weapons to unlock and upgradeInteresting story with unique and memorable charactersHighly replay-ableCons One character is very simplistic to play  For new comers, the skills and different characters can be overwhelming Some of the combat arenas become predictable Any key skips a cutscene with no warning (including tab + shift for steam overlay)  Camera angle with keyboard and mouse is often jankyStory*No Spoilers* DMC5 has a pretty interesting story that most players will appreciate after having played the previous games. However, for newcomers, it’s still fairly easy to follow as the game has a fairly lengthy introductory cutscene, along with gradual tutorials that also give you lore at the same time. All of the characters are well developed and playing as different ones at varying times in the story adds a lot to the experience as well. Having plenty of cutscenes was a nice change of pace from all the murder and mayhem, as fun as that was. Overall, the story in DMC is very well done and ties into the old games, but is still accessible to newcomers (though players would benefit from watching a synopsis at least).  GameplayThis is where the meat of this game is. And also, where you will take a lot of meat out of demons (because hey, they deserve it). The gameplay in DMC5 is smooth, brutal, and requires fast reflexes. It feels like riding a roller coaster that you’re not wearing a seat belt on… increasingly exciting and invigorating, but if you lose control and thus your groove, you will be punished. One additional note is that the game seems to encourage multiple playthroughs, since you cannot unlock everything the first time through and you unlock additional modes or further upgrades upon your first campaign completion. The gameplay can roughly be divided into a few categories, though with some overlap: Combat, Skills, Items, and Exploration.The combatThe combat in DMC5 is essentially third person hack and slash with lots of different combos or skills you can utilize. A very important fact to keep in mind is that combat varies greatly between characters as well, so you can expect a large amount of variety. The battles primarily take place inside a locked arena (similar to Doom 2016) which means there is truly no escape, and you must fight to the death. There are a few roaming enemies throughout the course of the game but most of the battles are very focused, intentional events. Correctly making combo moves and switching up attack styles quickly results in a higher score in your missions, with the highest being “SSS”. Most combat consists of a primary attack using some sort of melee weapon (like a sword or fists), with a secondary attack that is often ranged (like a revolver or shotgun). Another important element is the “lock-on” feature that lets you concentrate on a specific enemy, and which also acts as a modifier for certain attacks. In addition, enemy attacks can often be countered or dodged with the correct time and combination of keys.  SkillsBranching out from these basic attacks, are skills and movements you can unlock that all can be affected by different keys or buttons. A single primary attack can be totally different by simply using your forward action or reverse action, or holding lock on with a movement key. The upgrade system really goes insanely in-depth here, providing the player the opportunity to really experiment and find the skills they enjoy. Skills are unlocked with red orbs which are essentially in-game currency, that is dropped from kills and can also be found scattered throughout the maps. As the game progresses, a lot of new and different ultimate skills can be unlocked, that push the combat ability to the max. Depending on the character, some truly devastating powers can be unleashed that knock all but the most powerful demons into bits. These ultimate powers however take time to charge and can be replenished in various but limited ways. ItemsDMC5 also allows item utilization to aid players in beating it. For instance, there are certain orbs you can pick up that restore your health, or permanently upgrade it. One orb will revive you on the spot if you die in a battle. This does however reduce your score level in the mission. There are various weapons and items you can select from before you start a mission, essentially customizing your loadout.ExplorationFinally, exploration actually plays a pretty significant part in DMC5. For all the vicious combat and lively action, there is a surprising amount of hidden secrets that reveal extra missions or items. Also, there are a few small environmental puzzles that you need to figure out to progress, but they are nothing complicated. Often times, exploration will really help with future battles since you can find important upgrades or even replenish health before a boss.Graphics and VisualsGraphics and optimization are where DMC5 really shines. The character faces and animations are impeccable, and the environments are detailed with fantastic atmosphere. The combat is only made better because of this, as there is nothing quite like seeing high resolution demon blood flying across the screen! SoundDMC5 has very well-designed audio, with lots of audio cues and combat that provides plenty of feedback. The only audio-related aspect that really stood out in a good way, was the soundtrack. DMC5 frankly has an amazing soundtrack, with really memorable tracks that fit perfectly to the high intensity combat. Another cool detail is the music intensity increases with the score the player racks up during combat. I still find myself playing the songs after completing the game and headbanging along with them.Bugs, Glitches and CrashesI did experience one bug with the game. After using Steam overlay, a couple times the game wouldn’t fully recognize my input and so I couldn’t move or switch weapons. I had to reload a checkpoint to get around this. Another technical complaint I have is that the cutscenes will skip with the press of any key, so keep your fingers off the keyboard if you want to watch the cutscenes. However, you CAN re-watch cutscenes from the main menu. Price… is it worth it?DMC5 is currently listed at $59.99, which is typical for a newer AAA game. For true fans of the DMC franchise, this price is easily worth it because of how re-playable the game is and a decently long campaign. For newcomers such as myself, I got the game on the most recent sale for $19 which was definitely a bargain for the high-quality experience.ConclusionIn conclusion, DMC5 seems to be a nearly flawless addition to the DMC franchise with lots of fluid and technical combat, an intense story, and absolutely gorgeous visuals. For someone completely new to the franchise and even to the genre, it is worth picking up on sale and obliterating some demons.

261;Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;"I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. What more could you want?";Recommended;1,221.1;13/06/2020;756;18;;8.0
262;Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;Most enjoyable grind everI’m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers. ProsGood graphicsA lot of contentVery challengingA lot of monsters to huntNo p2w crapNice coopConsPerformance could be slightly betterWhile there are a lot of monsters, many of them feel too similar to each otherMy curator page;Recommended;106.9;6/06/2019;550;20;;8.0
263;Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;Edit: Just an update on this review. After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.Previous Review:This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game.;Recommended;388.0;23/03/2021;1,281;11;;9.0

265;Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;I'm in my mid 40's so I don't always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter: World has me hooked. Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun.;Recommended;103.6;21/08/2019;537;13;;10.0
266;Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;Now that this game has gotten a resurgence, here's a PSA.There's something called the Defender's Set in the beginning of the game. Now MH does nothing to explain it but it is basically endgame quality gear blueprint given to everyone in the forge from the beginning of the game. It's basically a means for players to speedrun their way through the game to reach Iceborne, the expansion. Literally speedrunning because the weapons do so much damage that it negates every reason to interact with basically every mechanic in the game. Monster weaknesses, equipment types, literally any reason to pop open the hunter guide, look at what a monster is weak to, where its weakness is, and what elements might help. All of this is useless with the Defender Set. Farming materials to make the next tier of gear, progressively getting stronger and basically interacting with the ladder of equipment or crafting as a whole is negated as well.If you want to play Monster Hunter with all its features, don't use the Defender Set. Because in the end the game is about the journey, not the destination. Learning how to be a monster hunter, and how to hunt well for your class is exceptionally fun in this game.But by all means if you want to breeze through this game, blowing past the entire base game just to reach the expansion where you'll most definitely get your ass kicked because you don't know the mechanics of the game, go ahead. In the end you're either learning the game in the beginning, or learning the game in the end. Benefits of learning the game in the beginning is that you have more content. Negatives of learning the game later is that you just wasted the base game away for no reason.;Recommended;30.7;31/12/2023;743;12;;7.0
267;Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;"If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!";Recommended;867.8;9/11/2018;780;25;;9.0

269;Capcom;Street Fighter V;Action;R$ 84,00;All the frustration of a freemium game economy, whilst still having to pay a traditional game's up front costs. I got this game on sale, and still honestly feel ripped off. With the base version of the game, the majority of the the content is hidden behind a pay wall. Including most importantly the characters, I would be fine if it was just cosmetics, but over half the cast is inaccessible (don't even get me started on the stages, music, cosmetics etc). Was genuinely shocked to discover that Capcom's reaction to people's frustration with how slow in game currency was earnt at release, was to cut income even further! now the only way to get fight money (the in game currency), is through levelling up, or from online matches. The online matches give you 50 fight money for a win, for context to unlock a character is 100,000......yeah (new stages are 70,000, costumes are 40,000). That should tell you everything about the game's economy you need to know. The sad thing is the game itself is pretty good, what little you get to play of it anyway. I have loved street fighter since I first played SF2 in the arcades.But what capcom did with SF5 has really soured my view of any future involvement with the series. This is all obviously done in a cynical attempt to squeeze more money out of their costumers (who again have already paid for the base game), but i'm not spending another penny on this game, this anti consumer BS needs to end.;Not Recommended;603.6;3/12/2018;1,426;16;;1.0

275;Capcom;Street Fighter V;Action;R$ 84,00;After many hours, a great number of ranked matches and late night lobbies, and a couple local tournaments, I can finally say confidently that I do not recommend this game.The singleplayer content is barebones and not at all worth playing. This is fine in a competitive fighting game, since the focus is more on competitive multiplayer. If you're not interested in that, take a hard pass on Street Fighter V and play a fighting game with worthwhile singleplayer content. Guilty Gear Xrd is a good one.Mechanically, the game isn't bad at all. It's fairly simple, with a modest amount of easy to understand mechanics that lead to interesting gameplay. It's also popular, so you can always find people online to play with. It's not a difficult game to pick up, and it's more accessible and rewarding than most other fighting games. That said, I still have a few problems with the gameplay.Namely:* Defensive options are awful. This is why high level play is just watching people do meaty setups on eachother. It's also why throw loops are as prevalent as they are.* Questionable design decisions, such as removing frame 1 invuln from all meterless DPs. This really skews the risk/reward of those moves, which is an odd choice from a game franchise that's so rooted in pure and simple fighting game fundamentals.* Timing is sort of strange. It's a game with 3 frame normals, so things like blockstrings and meaty attacks need to be pretty airtight. If they're not (and it's hard for them to be with any sort of network stutter in the mix) then mashing light buttons will get you out of a lot of situations. This should be a bad habit, but it's rewarding in this game for some reason.* The input delay/netcode makes it feel pretty unresponsive. If you're coming from other fighting games, expect to get hit by many fullscreen moves (Balrog's rush punches, Cammy's EX spiral arrow, Ken's EX tatsu) if you don't block preemptively.In terms of everything aside from the gameplay, it's an inexcusable travesty. The netcode is terrible, and even on wired connections with people in my own hometown it feels jerky and frustrating. Other fighting games add input delay, or seem to run the game in slow motion. SFV just teleports you from one connected attack to the next so you can watch yourself die in a jerky mess of unreactable attacks. The netcode also seems to send all the lag to the person with better internet. I remember having a really good night on ranked with seemingly stable connections and slow witted opponents, only to later realize I had been torrenting and my sister had been watching Netflix, presumably sending all the lag to my opponents.Unlocking characters, costumes, colors, and stages requires either making microtransactions with real world money, or spending ingame currency, which is extremely limited and for the most part non-renewable. You get 50 fight money for a win in a ranked match, zero for a loss. Characters cost 100,000 fight money each. You do the math. All the good cosmetics in this game are behind paywalls that you'd expect to see in free to play games. But it's a full price triple-A title, and the character season passes are also inexcusably expensive.Capcom has been pretty terrible with supporting this game as well. Patches are frequently delayed by weeks if not months, and it's missing many quality of life changes that should have been included at time of release (eg. saving battle lounge settings when the game closes, or being able to skip the awful tutorial on a fresh install). They also straight up lied about a Linux release. That was supposed to happen concurrent with the Windows release, but there has been no word from Capcom on that front.I could go on. There's been a very long train of disappointments with this game, and you shouldn't hop on it. Maybe they'll release Super Street Fighter V as the rumors say, and then I'll give this review another revision, but I don't see things changing for the better. The game is still going to be expensive, laggy, and unsatisfying. But it's got a lot of players, so it's got that going for it.Crossplay is very nice though.

288;CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;RPG;R$ 129,99;"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""Witcher 3 TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas.

289;CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;RPG;R$ 199,90;"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.";Recommended;140.2;16/02/2022;5,241;86;;1.0

297;CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;RPG;R$ 199,90;"I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 2 years later... I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch. I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 1 day later...I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.2 days later...I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam. just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. Present day... This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!Some thoughts:This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. P.S.Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.";Recommended;73.0;28/09/2022;616;10;;10.0

309;2K Games;NBA 2K21;Simulation, Sports;;"It would honestly be fair to call 2K an evil company at this point. There are only two options. either the company is staffed solely by incompetent developers who are incapable of creating a functioning game OR, much more likely, they knowingly, annually, decide to tighten the screws of their monopoly around the heads of literally millions of kids who shell out billions of dollars in revenue to this company every year.We can talk about rampant cheating, abysmal AI, or the horrific optimization that is sure to make even a beginer-level programmer cry himself to sleep. I, however, think it is much more interesting to talk about the scam itself: to purposefully make the game unbearable throughout every facet of its gameplay. The sheer malignance of such behavor is difficult to understand for normal people, but here it is important to understand how financial incentives choke the life out of every argument for game improvements that is not bounded in optimizing the ""revenue stream.""As a monopoly 2K has no incentive to make anything ""well."" There is simply no reason to. If you like basketball simulators there is only one game to play. 2K has acknowledged this in their earnings reports before, as far as I am aware. Making the game unplayable is actually profitable. If you drip-feed as little fun and engagement to your players as humanly possible and hide even this behind as many paywalls as possible, you create the illusion that ""once you pay just a *bit* more the game will get fun,"" but it just never does. It's economics for elementary schoolers, and it works magic. It's a freemium game that you pay 60 euros for every year. A cash cow only rivaled by the Madden/FIFA franchises.The only people who get lost and stepped on in this process are all of us players, who succumb to a love of basketball every year, and every year walk away disappointed. The worst thing is that I'll probably keep playing. I'll suffer through 10-15% of every mycareer game consisting of advertisements and skippable-after-a-while cutscenes. I'll suffer through trying again and again for literally hours to get games in the rec center, only for my teammates to lag out for the 10th time, or for the entire opposing team to consist of 110-everything-with-every-badge-in-the-game hackers. I'll get booted/dc'd/lagged out in a hundred different ways, while walking a tightrope trying to avoid the myriad of game-breaking bugs and glitches that the game """"""features""""""And for what? Because Lord forgive me I can't windmill dunk in real life, so allow me to do it digitally pls.When I - rarely - watch anything featuring 2K developers talking about their ""love for the fans"" or how much the game means to them, all I can think about is how they can possibly be so disrespectful. The solutions are not difficult, they are not even expensive or technically demanding, and yet they will never be implemented. It pays so much more dividends to invest in ""2KTV"" or the new look of the neighborhood. It's a slap in the face of every player, every day of every week of every month of every year. If I met any of the developers in real life I would tell them to their face that I hope everyone they've ever known are ashamed of them. And if any developers are reading this: you are working for the Monsanto of the video game industry. Every day you lie and cheat and scam is hopefully another step on your route to social leper status. Enjoy our money, and my unbridled disgust.";Not Recommended;278.2;5/12/2020;2,430;141;;1.0

321;2K Games;WWE 2K20;Simulation, Sports;;I use this to simulate matches. Like other versions it follows the tradition of getting worse. Here's an ever growing list of issues. - If you try to have anymore than 6 creations in a match it has a solid chance of crashing.- Crashes during editing characters or teams on the regular.- Crashes during rumbles frequently. - Horrible glitches are a normal encounter. One character has a mask and it is always stuck like a ship anchor to the middle of the ring. Another's hair floats above his head still despite devs saying they fixed that ages ago.- It refuses to save champions after a title changes hands in a match. Have to go in manually every single time to change it. - Custom belts are still glitching.- Characters will sometimes freeze in place thus dooming the match to never end.- The crowd sound is still completely bugged/done terribly as previous years. It's not so much a crowd as 7 or 8 tracks that will just play at random times. If a heel does a move they boo but a second later a face does one and the track resets to cheers. This is hell in anything other than singles matches.- If you pick any arena except Mania the crowd is unbearable. They just added in more tracks as you get into bigger arenas. So anything but Mania just means more noticeable track changes.- Creepy van entrance goes right through most arena stages.- Announcer gets stuck on a loop all the time. Most prominent in the run down high school gym.- Can't turn off tap out mini game in some cases. - For the love of god still can't have backstage pinfalls or submissions. Why does it always have to end in a random KO????? They have falls count anywhere matches but you can't just set a backstage brawl into an actual match instead. Overall this is a pathetic disservice to fans of WWE and these games. They make you pay so much for what is a copy and paste job of last year.

339;Sega;Total War: THREE KINGDOMS;Action, Strategy;R$ 149,99;My pedigree: ~500 hours Shogun 2 (+Darthmod), ~300 hours Warhammer 1, mostly played Very Hard.I'm not a Total War expert but I understand most of its principles. Though I'm only a few hours into Three Kingdoms I'd like to point out some highlights here as most reviews I read were too abstract and didn't signal the major differences 3K has from older Total War games.Military:In general battles resemble Shogun 2 with its spear/sword/ranged/cavalry/siege basic archetypes. Units are arranged to maximize rock-paper-scissors match-ups, and generally volume wins. However there is the notable shake-up of:-Romance Mode-  this essentially makes the generals like heroes from Warhammer, for better or worse. Strong 1v1 generals will win battles, period. Dueling and killing generals will crush morale and cheese fights just like targeted damage spam from Warhammer. The AI is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot win, and even when they reject them you can simply right-click on them and get the same result. So far I have not seen any troops be effective against high-stat generals — it's common to outmaneuver an invasion using your garrison troops to route the enemy only to have their general stick around and solo your remaining squads.Of course if you don't like that you can simply play Records mode, which I haven't tried yet.-Roster-Although all units fall into classic archetypes, there are more units than reviews insinuated. Most of these are gated behind general archetypes and technology. I can see these units substantially affecting the outcome of fights if you can afford them. An example: auto-crossbow units from high-Cunning generals will grant you a highly cost-effective ranged unit at the expense of a very weak general. This might be a good choice for a defensive army that has walls to garrison.-Military Supply-This is the largest difference from previous titles in terms of military. All armies have a pool of 100 supplies that slowly fills in your own territory and rapidly drains in enemy territory and during the winter — 30 lost to enemey territory, another 25 for winter (even in your own territory). Once your supplies hit zero you suffer massive attrition losses. This can be improved with infrastructure and character traits, but without significant investments the net effect is that distant campaigns and prolonged sieges are extremely high-risk. Aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion. This, combined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacements, forces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense. Gone are the days of spamming Ashigaru to handle an unexpected attack, or endlessly raiding a territory while waiting for reinforcements. Likewise the AI can't use these strategies, solving the cat-and-mouse games everyone hated in Warhammer.Strategy layer:This is where I feel this game really shines compared to its predecessors. There are many new mechanics here that are brilliantly interlaced. One decision often begets 6 more, requiring lots of forethought.-Commanderies (a.k.a. provinces)-This has been made far more complicated than previous titles. The game features a massive web of building trees, each replete with collateral effects and synergies that make you consider the province as a whole rather than the usual one-problem-one-building method we're used to. Compounding this is the commanderies system — known as provinces in Warhammer, these are groups of territories that are designed to be held together. One territory of a commandery will contain the city and most of the buildings, while attached territories will contain an exclusive building tree. Because building synergies are so powerful you are highly incentivized to own an entire commandery instead of mere parts. This adds more intrigue to expansionist aggression as well as the excellent diplomacy system — with good relations the AI will gladly trade territories of equal value with you.-Staff-Managing your administration is a large component of 3K. Even with optimal buildings you will not have enough income without the right staff multiplying their benefits. Each staff's personality quirks will play heavily into what managing them will entail — in general you want to hire like-minded people to reduce conflict and maximize satisfaction, but it is also important to hire personalities who satisfy the needs of your economy (vanguards are better for industry, commanders for peasants, etc). Black sheep can still be effective so long as they're kept away from their associates. Failing to satisfy them can have heavy consequences — people with significant power in your government can even start a civil war. In my first run I found myself occasionally firing people I hired with insufficient foresight to avoid showering them in promotions or letting tensions boil over.One final layer worth mentioning: all of these characters are persistent and historied, often having served other leaders before you. This mostly has implications with Espionage which I'm not experienced enough to talk about yet.-Diplomacy-In Shogun 2 all of the leaders seemed like schizophrenics with borderline disorder, refusing trade and breaking alliances randomly. In Warhammer diplomacy was hardly possible at all. From that low bar 3K has made massive improvements. Leaders are generally more reasonable and fit their ascribed personalities well. Diplomatic intrigue has so far satisfied me more than any Total War or 4x.The same diplomatic options from Shogun and Total War are present, but you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often. Items, payments, and marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreements, and territories can be traded to mutual benefit. Enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall. Cao Cao can stir the pot with the ability to start proxy wars.The confederation system is the icing on the cake. Forging large confederations will require you to navigate carefully, as new members must be approved by a majority of existing ones, and voting in opposition of members will sour your relations. Furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak. That means order is important, and you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first. All of this complicates your expansionism, perhaps forcing you to take risks on distant campaigns rather than upset an ally, or an ally's-ally, by attacking your borders.Performance:If you're a Total War veteran you know why this section is here. I'm playing on this rig[www.userbenchmark.com] and the game runs flawlessly on a 2k 144hz monitor and looks great even with swarms of units on screen. If you're new to Total War and don't have an SSD, buy one. The more battles you have the more time you'll spend loading. I've been enjoying 5 second loads on my M.2.TL.DRIn total the game becomes slow and deliberate compared to its predecessors, which largely devolved into paint-by-numbers spamfests. Controlled growth is key, and many decisions will require you to think several turns ahead. If you're playing Total War with an emphasis on battles with diverse armies and lots of spectacle you will be more at home in Warhammer, but hardcore strategists will love this game.I hope this wall of text was useful;Recommended;26.8;27/05/2019;1,972;37;;8.0

342;Sega;Total War: THREE KINGDOMS;Action, Strategy;R$ 149,99;As a long time Total War fan, I wasn't looking forward to this one.  I have no interest in the time period or location.  My favorites in the series are rome 2 and the warhammer series.  I decided to give three kingdoms a try, and now I don't think I can ever go back.  It is so good, it makes every previous TW seem archaic.  Specifically, diplomacy and the campaign side of things have been improved so much.  The choices you make affect so much more with coalitions, alliances, and vassals.  There is a lot more character development, to the point that you care so much about your council members, family members, and allies.  These individuals become intertwined, forcing you to really think about each negotiation.  Indeed, if you lose a general you care about, your other generals in battle will go berserk with rage if they have developed a good relationship.Another impressive feat is performance.  Aside from a weird UI issue on the campaign map side, battles play absolutely beautiful.  I have engaged large battles as often as I can to really push my computers limit (i7 7700k, 16GB Ram, 1080 Duke video card) and I rarely get a noticable drop.  As a side note, the music is awesome.  Whether it's when a battle is about to commence or during the battle itself, the fanfare really draws you in.three kingdoms has not just set a standard for the TW series. it's set a standard for strategy games.  You can tell how much work went in to this game and how much attention to detail there is.  It is truly an impressive experience, and I can't recommend it enough.;Recommended;536.6;28/05/2019;552;9;;9.0

348;Sega;Total War: THREE KINGDOMS;Action, Strategy;R$ 149,99;"Before I start I would like to say this is my first total war game, I also spent a significant chunk of time of my childhood growing up in China but I will leave the review in English both as a practice to my writing but also I feel like it might be interesting to portray my thoughts to people from a different culture about a game that takes place on my homeland. The gameplay is addicting and captivating to strategy game fans that makes you say ""One more turn before bed"" to yourself constantly. One of the very first video game I touched was Starcraft 2 back in 2010, so I really enjoy the fact that there are real time combat in a turn based strategy game, it feels refreshing after playing SC2 for years and hundreds hours of Civilization.I also really really enjoy the music, there are not many tracks which is a downside, but I absolutely love how they did the music. Here is one of my favorite piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MYAzRwrscQ The music make use of several ancient Chinese instrument and weaves them together into a beautiful masterpiece.The overall visual is very beautiful to look at, not stunning, but really easy on the eyes, the campaign map of China uses vibrant colors to show contrast between rivers, land and trees, not only is the campaign map beautiful to look at, there are also peasants working on the fields, soldiers patrolling the main road,  pandas eating bamboos, and hunters hunting wild animals. making the entire map feel alive, small details goes a long way.Now let me talk about something I feel is lacking about this game:the multiplayer is somewhat lacking, when I play a co-op match, even after I signed the shared victory treaty I still can't reinforce my partner's army, I have to wait till I rank up to form a coalition to be able to do so, doing so makes the fact that the first half of a co-op game is just minding their own business, it's worse that sometimes you won't be able to see each other for a good 50 turns if you pick two factions that have distant starting locations.**Update 11/22/2021: It's been months since CA abandoned this game, a shame but my review still stands that this is a good game. Please note to get the 1.7.1 bug fix mod on workshop as it fixes many of the bugs that CA will never fix.**";Recommended;811.9;3/07/2019;356;12;;8.0

Thanks for understanding.So, I like to say that as i have beaten the main game with all characters including Mighty and Ray i think i have the right to write a review based on Sonic Mania. Upon starting up the game i didn't know what i was getting into expect for knowing that Green Hill and Chemical Plant Zone were going to be in the game knowing that they are memorable video game levels. But after beating the game five times. Every stage i played were all memorable and all had fun gimmicks to accompany them. A personal favorite of mine that isn't Green Hill or Chemical Plant was HydroCity zone which made me go ""jolly they made a water level fun!"" So, our playable line of characters are:Sonic- Everyone favorite Sega Mascot who basically plays the same in the other games but with this game they have the ability to do a dropdash which i didn't use much to be fairly honest.Tails- The two tailed fox who has the ability to fly which is basically the easy mode of the game if i want to be honest and are just a reskin of Sonic but they can flyKnuckles- A echidna who can glide and climb on walls who is the hard mode of the game given that he also has a reduce jump height other thing to know is that parts of the level is unique to Knuckles which adds something new to the tableMighty- A armadillo that can do a ground pound which plays the same as sonicRay- A flying squirrel that can glide but with enough downforce can go back up to gain height as a way to flyThe Level Design: The level design of Sonic Mania is something that i enjoy for the most part since levels are meant to be replay to find new routes and find all the hidden special stages that are hidden in each zone. During my five different playthroughs i always found new routes that i never found back in my first playthrough thanks to what the character brought to the table or just pure curiosity that came across my mind.The Music:The music is something that i enjoyed to the fact that its hard to choose a personal favorite. I love the new remixes of old tracks like Green Hill Zone Act 2 and Chemical Plant Zone Act 2 which I should also mention that I enjoy how each act of a zone has different music but are yet familiar to keep in check with the tone and setting of the zones.Overall Score: 10/10Why I give it a 10/10? My reasoning is that this is one of the games that I played and i enjoyed it so much that I want to come back to it which is my personal favorite classic sonic game as of now. Despite the game not being a 2021 title I think this is my goty even though this was made back in 2017.

If that’s not rad, I don’t know what is.On the other side of the coin, you also get to play Diner Dash as a breakdancing bat/knife wielding club manager cyclops with a harem. Who tries to get back into his previous occupation, but ends up getting into a crazy chain of events after discovering his newfound kink for blind girls. Holy sh*t.And that’s simply the main story, the sidequests/substories have almost as much meat while being just as succulent. Instead of cookie cutter content where you collect 20 bear pelts or some crap like that, there are wholesome and heartwarming sidequests such as. helping a minor acquire an adult magazine, shutting down a religious cult scam, a 1v1 disco duel against the King of Pop, etcetera. Even the official description includes its own example of “help a budding S&M dominatrix learn her profession” which is surprisingly a real sidequest.Speaking of side content, oh man. You remember those dime a dozen 27 in 1 games? The minigames in here are essentially those, but jacked up on whatever medicinal healing drinks these guys use.Minigames include activities fitting for the 80s like disco, karaoke (Heartbreak Mermaid fav song, let’s go boyz) and telephone dating clubs.

360;Sega;Yakuza 0;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 89,50;I've seen a lot of reviews try to win people over with an endless list of amusing anecdotes - winning chickens in a bowling game and making them a real estate manager. Training a dominatrix to be more assertive. Obliterating people in combat with a motorcycle.It's all true, of course. Yakuza 0 can be an immensely funny and absurd game with moments that's genuinely make you laugh out loud - largely because you could have never expected them.But I also think that's had the side effect of selling the game short. You might think this is a comedy game, something that is almost lighthearted or trivial.It's not.Yakuza 0 is a very serious game - a fact you might find surprising. Its plot is complex and is centered on a fairly dry subject of real estate intrigue in a booming market. It deals with mature, often terrible issues and has a cast of immensely realistic - and likable - characters set in an equally realistic city. Yakuza has the pacing and tone of a drama, and it must be enjoyed slowly like one.The comedy, then, is not the driver of this game, but rather serves as a much needed relief of tension. It's almost like there's a swinging pendulum in which the game is allowed to present you with increasingly intense and dramatic moments so long as it's all offset by an equally increasing level of absurdity. It helps space out the moments of self-seriousness in a way that just...works.Beyond just the tone and story is a very enjoyable brawler that constantly mixes it up with minigames, tough bosses, and other diversions. I do want to stress that this isn't necessarily a game you're coming back to for the gameplay - rather, you'll be coming for the story, the characters, the city itself.This isn't a bad thing, though, and I wish more games would take this approach. Yakuza 0 is a wonderful game.PS: Whoever did the localization for Yakuza 0 is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ genius.;Recommended;327.4;14/08/2018;501;10;;10.0

Yakuza 0's story is amazing and has you on the edge of your seat all the time wondering what will happen next. The side content of minigames and substories is hilariously entertaining and helps to break up the story's serious side for a change of pace. The brawler combat also feels impactful and strategic as you change your combat stance in order to suit the situation at hand to defeat waves of street thugs and yakuza mobs alike. The game is almost always on sale at an affordable price so it is an easy recommend for players looking to dive into a series full of wacky characters, weird NPC encounters, and underworld criminal affairs.GENRE:Action combat, story-centric/cinematic cutscenes, 2 semi-sandbox style city maps to exploreGAMEPLAY:The game jumps back and forth depending on the story chapters between playing two characters: Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima. When you are in control of a character in the city worlds of Kamurocho or Sotenbori, you are usually free to either head towards a pink marker on the map indicating main story progress, or to wander around the city and do random side activities ranging from random NPC substories to playing minigames like karaoke or dancing in the disco.Proceeding with main story quests usually leads to long, voice-acted cutscenes where the story unfolds and has you usually entering combat to deal with a plethora of grunts, thugs, and yakuza officials. The story has you play as Kiryu or Majima and you don't switch between the characters at will, at least until you complete the main story. Both of their arcs are important to the overall plot though and each of them have completely different battle styles and distinct combat maneuvers.The combat in Yakuza 0 is action-based and determined by your button inputs. Based on your skill tree investments, your skills develop in 3 different styles per character4 if you finish the game. Each style is usually better suited for certain situations (e.g. Kiryu's Beast style is amazing if you are among a sea of objects lying around the area, or Majima's Slugger style is useful for hard-hitting 1v1 situations). Your attacks are determined by your combination of light strikes, heavy strikes, guards, and grabs. As you connect with your hits and avoid being hit, you build up the Heat meter and once that meter hits a certain threshold, you can perform Heat actions which are brutal, environmental assaults that help you inflict a large amount of damage at once.Side content rewards you with comical questlines, weird NPC's, fun minigames, and more often than not good money-making methods. You can run into a kid who wants you to buy a dirty magazine for him, a Michael Jackson look-a-like who wants you to help him with his next music video, and a guy who can't cross a bridge without getting beat up because of a jacket he refuses to take off. You can take a break and visit a SEGA arcade to play some old-school games, go to a karaoke and sing some great songs, go bowling, go fishing, and more. At certain points, you unlock character-specific businesses that you can run and let's just say Majima's cabaret club business is the best minigame/mini storyline just in fun factor.GRAPHICS:Yakuza 0 looks and runs great. It doesn't employ the use of Ryu Ga Gotoku's newest Dragon engine yet, but it still holds up in presentation and performance. Main characters look distinct and are well-animated, city streets are filled with bright and colorful lights indicative of Japanese culture, and I experienced no significant performance dips throughout the entire game.  STORY:[Deliberately vague to avoid spoilers as you should definitely experience it for yourself]Yakuza 0 takes place in Japan in the 1980's during an economic bubble where money is overflowing in the streets. You begin playing as Kiryu, a member of a Yakuza family doing collection work in Kamurocho when suddenly, you find yourself wanted for murder when you didn't commit it. It appears that someone is out to frame Kiryu, and that is where his story unfolds. Simultaneously, a man named Majima is managing a cabaret in Sotenbori and making a lot of money, but his goal is not to be Sotenbori's famed Lord of the Night. It seems Majima needs his money for a different reason...STRENGTHS:•Yakuza 0's story is incredible like the rest of the games in the series. It is full of surprising twists, the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Since it is a prequel, players who have played the original Yakuza games are able to learn the backstories of the original characters in Kiryu and Majima and how they became who they were. The overall story of 0 is an amazing roller coaster of emotions.•The music is amazing. each combat style has its own background soundtrack to match its mood perfectly, the disco and karaoke tunes are banging tunes (with full versions available on YouTube), and the main antagonists have their own unique tracks as well (Kuze's theme is phenomenal). •There is no English dub, but the Japanese voice-acting is very good. •You encounter a lot of great & memorable characters throughout the game (though let's just say don't get too attached to any of them).•The game's pacing is up to your preference. you can hot shot all of the main story in one go, or break it up when you feel bored and want to dance to ""Friday Night"" at the disco for a few minutes.•Majima's cabaret club is the best minigame. WEAKNESSES:•A common complaint I've seen is that the game often feels like you are watching a movie when you are not in combat. It is a valid point since in story situations, most of the time you are just listening to the Japanese VA and reading the dialogue as it auto-scrolls so it can feel like you are inactively participating. •Regarding the combat, it feels very unfair later on in the game when enemies start carrying guns and attacking you from a distance, instantly knocking you down to the ground with one bullet. This isn't an issue in the beginning, but the combat feels like it ramps up, not in difficulty but in BS, dramatically towards the climax. NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9/10Yakuza 0 is a great starting point for someone new to the series, is usually low in price, contains an amazing & captivating story, and is full of entertaining side activities. I would highly recommend anyone to play this game, and the other Yakuza games in general. Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time.

369;Sega;Persona 4 Golden;RPG;R$ 99,99;I've never played a Persona game, and never really played JRPGs either to be honest. The fanciest I've ever gotten with these types of games is honestly Pokemon.This game is insane, and I'm loving it. The plot sucks you in, the characters usually make you laugh(there's a couple of moments that make me cringe, but hey so does everything with characters so whatever), and the gameplay is incredibly addicting.A lot of people reviewing are pushing this game as people who are playing it for nostalgia reasons, or because they love JRPGs and this is the cream of the crop. Let me say as a total newbie to the scene, Persona is just as inviting for new players as it is the long-time players.I 100% fully recommend this game to anyone who has even the slightest of interest in RPGs.;Recommended;76.7;17/06/2020;1,669;17;;10.0

371;Sega;Persona 4 Golden;RPG;R$ 99,99;Just to preface the review: I’m aware that this might get lost in the sea of reviews currently written for the game, but really, I don’t care. If this helps sway even a single person to get this game, then it’ll be worth it. Plus, after 100 hours of pure joy and entertainment, the very least I can do is add my own voice to the over 14k people who have already voiced their opinion. This game, aside from being a lot of fun, has become one of my favourites of all time. I was reminded of very important life lessons while playing, and that’s not something many games can accomplish.If you are a fan of JRPGs, or even remotely interested in this game, and want my final verdict without reading everything, here goes, in no uncertain terms:Get this game.-----------Disclaimer before I start: this is spoiler free. Any major plot point mentioned here is already readily available in the steam store page description or trailer - I’m using those as a guide for what’s a spoiler. So don’t worry!The game store page describes it as “A coming of age story that sets the protagonist and his friends on a journey kickstarted by a chain of serial murders.” I can safely say that is a better description than I will ever be able to come up with. From that, here’s what I can tell you about the story:- “...by a chain of serial murders”. It’s a murder mystery, and a REALLY good one. The story as a whole is incredible. It offers an extremely good balance of slice of life things and seriousness, and you actually look forward to both of those moments. Sprinkled along the game, you have full on anime cutscenes, which are freaking amazing, and while used sparingly, they were very well employed to build both tense moments and lighthearted moments.- “A coming of age story...” Now there’s an interesting term. Coming of age for who? Not just the protagonist. And herein lies the magic behind the game, and one of its strongest bases (I honestly cannot overstate this enough): the relationships. Throughout the game you, a new kid in town, meet a vast and amazing cast of characters. Some, you’re going to hate from the get go (sorry Chie. Ai). Some you’ll love (Rise best character and I’ll fight anyone who says otherwise). But I guarantee you: throughout the game, even if your opinion on them doesn’t change for better or worse (and there’s a good chance it will), you will notice a change in the characters, mainly because of its Social Link system.Coming off that point, I have to praise the game even further on one specific aspect: it has one of the best casts of main characters I have ever had the pleasure to see in a game. Your friends feel exactly like that: friends. Despite being fundamentally very different, every person in the group has such an amazing chemistry with each other that everything involving the group feels… natural. There are scenes that will make you cry from laughter, and others that will make your heart race as you see the events unfold on your screen. The characters aren’t perfect either. Quite the contrary: they’re flawed. They’re human, with all the quirks that come with that. One of them, for example, often goes into laughing fits at the weirdest moments - and as a person who often does the same, I couldn’t help but smile and relate to it whenever it happened. The core gameplay loop can be separated into two bits: dungeons and slice of life stuff. The game works with a calendar system: days go by just like in real life. Every day, you get 2 “slots” to do things - after school/afternoon and evening. Some days, story may occupy one, or both, of those slots. When you have the free time, you have free reign to do whatever you want with your days: you start at school, often answer a question posed by the teacher, and then all bets are off. You can talk to friends (some are only available on certain days), you can engage in various activities like fishing, you can study, heck, you can even go back in dungeons to explore them again. The game continues this way, until things happen and… you are locked into the story sequence that leads you to your next dungeon.Whenever you unlock a dungeon, you are given a time limit to do it, and can engage it anytime within the limit. The gameplay while dungeon-crawling is… monotonous at best. Coming from persona 5, I was severely disappointed with this aspect of the game. The dungeons are expansive, with multiple floors, but they are also semi procedurally generated, with little to no variation within each one. Every floor consists of corridors with square rooms every once in a while, unless it’s a special floor. Littered throughout the floor, you’ll find enemies - Shadows. A lot of them. Each dungeon took me 2-3 hours (as I’m cursed with the need to explore everything before moving on) and they were not fun. Even the combat, which is good - turn based with a unique element of creating new personas - is not enough to help that front. Eventually I resorted to watching tv shows while I mindlessly took care of the dungeons.And another important detail: the game takes a while to get going. You’re thrown into the mystery within the first hour, but if I recall correctly, I played for 2 or 3 hours until I was allowed actually do things in the game aside from reading. This is an issue with a lot of JRPGs, and to some people (like myself), it’s not an issue at all, but it’s still worth mentioning. This is a story to be experienced slowly, and not rushed through, and the beginning alone makes that very clear.The artstyle honestly is one of my favourites, and the game has an incredible soundtrack. Man oh man, the soundtrack. It is one of the strongest I’ve ever seen in a game. I’d put it up there, in my personal rankings, with the likes of nier automata, world ends with you, and of course, Persona 5. At times hauntingly beautiful, and at times downright unnerving, I promise you one thing: you will often catch yourself grasping at your headphones (if you play with them), just appreciating how much bliss is coming through your ears. I honestly can not WAIT to play the rhythm game, because with this amazing soundtrack involved, it’s going to be one hell of an experience. I’d link some videos here so you could hear it for yourself, but… I think you might be better off experiencing it in game.I do have another very important aspect to mention, which is the importance of this port. From the SMT mainline games to Persona, its spin offs/sequels, Catherine and even other, lesser known series and games, ATLUS has a lot of FANTASTIC games under its wings - all of them on platforms other than the PC. Nobody expected (as far as I’m aware anyway) a Persona game to come to PC, and while this was most likely SEGA’s doing, it really brings me joy to see the game, at the time of writing, with over 14k reviews, and sitting at “Overwhelmingly Positive”. Maybe, just maybe, with how successful this port has been, as well as the Catherine one, we’ll get the other games too. Now that this is on PC… anything is possible.There is a LOT more to say. My original review was twice as long, at least, before I found out steam had a set number of letters that I could use in a review. If you want to know more, I’m always down to talk. All in all, I truly believe this game is almost a masterpiece. What attracts me most in games is, by far, a good story, and words are not enough to describe how well the game delivers on that front. You’re going to enjoy every bit spent with the crew, and chances are it’ll be one of those bittersweet endings, where you’re happy you experienced the story, but sad that it’s over. I know that’s how it was for me.Thank you for reading, and if you do jump in... I sincerely hope you enjoy the ride. Words are simply not enough to express how much I did.;Recommended;100.4;26/06/2020;2,027;41;;10.0
