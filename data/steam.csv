Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.I should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  So right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  None of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.What kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  I’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.The team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.I’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  I wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.Okay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.The hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  Also I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  I won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  If you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.;Recommended;418.7;24/01/2019;2,483;115
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise. Graphics Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.  Story The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy. The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me. Gameplay If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything. You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities. Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with. As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.  Grind? I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue. Final Recommendation I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss. Pros-Stunning Game World-Interesting Story-Well thought-out RPG mechanics -Tons of things to do-Exhilarating CombatCons-Lame mid-late game pacing-Poor rendering-Executions aren't greatFinal Rating - 8.6/10If you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity. an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the "decisions" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another. chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!;Recommended;234.8;5/10/2018;1,524;32
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey  ⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:              - Main Story - 43½ Hours              - Main + Extras - 83 Hours               - Completionist - 137 Hours By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review. ⚔ Gameplay: 🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)🔲 Definitely🔲 Infinitely replayableThe game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game. 😄 Fun: 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy☑️ Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember🔲 Ride of your lifeAs a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did. 🏞 Graphics: 🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game🔲 Good (nothing special)☑️ Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceThe graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work. 🔊 Sound: 🔲 Makes your ears bleed🔲 Bad☑️ Not special🔲 Good🔲 Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceI felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven. 📖 Story: 🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story🔲 It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written☑️ Epic story🔲 MasterpieceWithout spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter. 🧵 Length: 🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee🔲 Short🔲 Average☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)🔲 To infinity and beyondAccording to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.I wish it would be shorter. 💷 Price: 🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price☑️ Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of moneyDepending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore. 🧩 Difficulty: 🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it🔲 Easy☑️ Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too. ⚖ Pros & Cons:  ➕ Pros: + The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all. ➖ Cons: - It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.- Too long. I really wish it would be shorter.- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult. only a few of them get that treatment. ⚙ Bugs: 🔲 Never heard of☑️ Minor bugs🔲 Can get annoying🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsI've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU. ⭕Conclusion: AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.Originally posted by TalePlay: If you've read this far, I want to say thank you and do check our Curator Page called TalePlay.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;I bought the Gold Edition, which seems to have a better value. Here's some info on the different editions:Standard Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game) DELUXE DIGITAL PACK: - Kronos pack - contains the full Armour of Kronos armour set, the Hourglass mount, and the spear "Harvester of Time" - this pack gives more warrior damage boost- Herald of Dusk pack - contains the full Herald of Dusk set of armour, and the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focused.- Capricornus Naval Pack - contains the Capricornus boat and sailor skins - purely cosmetic.- Temporary boosts to XP and money - boost lasts for 2 hours.Gold Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)SEASON PASS: LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE, THE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece + The Games: Assassin's Creed III REMASTERED and Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTERED. Ultimate Edition (Digital) Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition - Check the Content Info AboveSEASON PASS - Check the Content Info AboveSo, the only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content. Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on. up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on sale, though I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition.Note:  You can not upgrade to Deluxe Edition later on, meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition, and that's money wasted. Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later on, is not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise. You are saving money and getting the best of the game. For Season Pass owners (which is in the Gold and Ultimate Editions) - Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered will not appear in your library as it is a part of, and available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered. So, in order to play Liberation Remastered, you need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered. Both Remasters are slightly better graphically, than their previous versions. You have to launch Assassin's Creed Odyssey once, before trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition. Otherwise, the Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activation, which is not possible anymore.  For any problems with the Ubisoft client: Verify Integrity of Game Files on Steam and if it doesn't work then uninstall the Ubisoft client and delete the current version and redownload the client from the Ubisoft site. If you still have problems then God help you dealing with Ubisoft/Steam support.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;(DRM notice: this game requires a Uplay account, requires you to connect to Uplay when starting up, and it also uses Denuvo DRM. DRM is inherently bad for the customer so I wanted to warn you about that.)Far Cry 5 is a decent entry into the series, and often underrated in comparison to previous titles.Honestly, if you played Far Cry 2, 3 or 4 - you know what to expect. Same game, different setting. The main reason people rate it lower than 3 and 4 is because by this point, they've grown tired of the same old formula (and because of the weird ending, but I'm not gonna spoil that... you have to see it for yourself). Far Cry 5 is just as good as its predecessors. That said, let's give this a proper analysis, shall we?You shoot bad guys. This time it's in rural America.It's a Far Cry game. What did you expect? It follows the Ubisoft open world formula of a big world occupied by enemy forces, which you slowly liberate by wiping out enemy outposts like you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rambo. There's a basic but functional stealth system of silent melee takedowns, silent weapons like bows, throwing knives, and silenced guns, and enemies raising the alarm if they see you or find a dead body. You can conquer outposts either by going in slow and methodical, or you can just storm in guns blazing and mow everyone down with an MG. The combat is fun. Controls are pretty smooth, most weapons are satisfying to use, and neither you nor the enemy are bullet sponges. Sometimes you will have to deal with enemy helicopters, or you can fly one yourself to rain death from above. Fun!The only criticism I have compared to earlier Far Cry titles (especially Far Cry 1 and 2) is how the physics engine has been dialed down a bit. Many items are static objects that don't ever move (I kicked a bunch of cans and they just stayed in place... lame), and most cover can't be pierced by bullets, unlike earlier games where thin wooden walls could easily be penetrated by high caliber weaponry. At least the fire spreading mechanics are still there, making the flamethrower a potentially devastating weapon... with which you can easily grill yourself if you're not careful.The game is set in Hope County, a fictional area in the US state of Montana, where a crazy cult is taking over and forcibly recruiting the population. You arrive as a policeman (or policewoman, this is the first Far Cry game with character customization and you get to pick your gender) coming to arrest the leader of that cult, but of course the cultists fight back and you have to run. During the course of the game, you meet with various resistance members and help them fight the cult until they are wiped off the map. The setting is quite enjoyable, especially if you like rural America. As a European, I find American culture quite fascinating, and this game is full of it. All the resistance people are proud American patriots, and you get to see a lot of those weird roadside attractions they have in the rural US, like a park with giant plastic mammoth statues and farms that advertise their tomatoes with giant tomato signs. Very quaint.I got captured... AGAINAs far as the story structure is concerned, the antagonists are pretty interesting and the story overall is competently told. But the way they force you into the main quest missions... yeah, that's definitely questionable. Whenever you earn enough "Resistance Points" in a region (by doing side quests or liberating outposts), the bad guys will send a capture party to abduct you. They don't just do it once per region, but several times. When I finished the game, I had been captured at least six times... and if we count the scenes where Faith puts you into a drug-induced trance so she can try and convert you to the cult, that increases to nine times.Nine. Times.And each time, you - of course - manage to escape and kill a whole bunch of cultists in the process. They should have realized that keeping you alive is a bad idea after the second time, but nope. They just keep abducting you and try to convert you to their cause, until you finally kill all the leaders. Of all the methods they could have used to drive the story forward, this is by far the dumbest. It almost feels like the bad guys are deliberately giving you a chance over and over again.The cult leaders are appropriately vile and violent characters, and the acting and animation is really good. I usually hate cutscenes, but I found the ones in Far Cry 5 to be quite engaging, because the characters are so interesting. I have to rate the main story as "good", but... the way they keep using that abduction mechanic to drive the plot forward... that's just stupid. So utterly stupid. And the worst part is that it can hit you anywhere once you triggered it. Doing a sidequest right now? Haha sorry, abduction squad is here. Flying around in a helicopter? Yeah there's a sedative arrow in your leg now, don't ask where it came from. It's just dumb.You've seen it before. It's nothing new, but it's good.Really, apart from the dumb way they handled the main story progression with those stupid abduction scenes, Far Cry 5 doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's another competently made Far Cry game. More of the same for people who enjoy this style of game. Open world driving around, shooting bad guys, doing side quests. It even has the same mission types as the previous Far Crys: rescue a friend and man the gun while he drives the truck to your home base, go to a location and kill the enemies, find collectibles and bring them to an NPC, etc etc. The standard fare as usual. Did you play Far Cry 3 or 4? This is like that, except set in Montana instead of a tropical island or Tibet.If you like Far Cry games, you're gonna like this. If you don't, you won't.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;In a nutshell:Pros:1. Good graphics2. Surprises in the story at the end3. Game physics is good4. More involvement of Bosses in game (unlike Far Cry 4), which is good.5. Adds lot more contents in the game when compared to its predecessors.6. Availability of Guns for hire. OR form Your own squad with AI characters, which gets unlocked as the story progress.7. No more tower capture to unlock a region (although some elements of it exists here too)8. More detailed and realistic gun/vehicular battles.9. Support for Co-op in Story mode.10. Arcade mode for some extra game play.Cons:1. Even on pretty good configuration PC(GTX 1070 8GB), FPS drops to 30 sometimes, but not many instances. Probably because the game is tailored for AMD graphics.2. No option to change difficulty in middle of game story. Need to play out entire story in same difficulty level.3. Too much content in Game User Interface (UI) /Map which causes the UI to be cluttered.4. If You are someone who is moving up the far cry timeline and played FC3 and FC4 before this, You might take at least an hour of game play to understand the game features.5. In gun battles, hit reg not accurate sometimes.6. Co-op in story mode restricted to only 2 players in total (i.e. Yourself and one friend).7. If You invite Your friend to play in Co-op, only Your story proceeds/missions complete, and your friend's does not. Above Pros and Cons should be sufficient if You do not have time to read through the detailed review and need to decide if You want to buy this game or not. More detailed review below.P.S: Please play this game before playing Far Cry: New Dawn, to enjoy the new dawn instalment better.In Detailed Review:The Game:Unlike prior Far cry instalments, this game environment has more modern vibes to it. So, You'll have more modern weapons, and visiting a place on the map reveals it. No more tower climbing to remove cloaking.Basically, the map is a group of islands, ruled over by one main Boss (The Father) and 3 under bosses (His 2 brothers and 1 sister, well not biological though, haha). They together form a cult and make life hell for the natives. Its either join the cult or face Your maker, simple right?So, You play the role of a rookie deputy who will fight Your way to liberate the islands, and there is lots of story and elements to it on the way.The bosses:Each boss brings in their own flavour and elements to the story and game play, which is kind of good and makes missions less repetitive. The more outposts You liberate (not many, may be 4 to 5 outposts per boss) and more missions You complete (given by the natives), the more interest the local boss takes in You, taking you closer to defeat them.The Vehicles:A wide variety of Vehicles available, like trucks, vans, SUVs, boats etc along with the new addition of airplanes and helicopters, which can be used in free roam and missions.Guns for Hire:Basically 2 types:Type 1: CivilianEach civilian You rescue from the cults grasp during free roam can be used as a Gun for hire during next mission, until You release them. They ride with You, they can die for You, kill for You with guns blazing or with stealth. They can be found all over the map. No specialisations as such, good for regular gun fights.Type 2: Story AI CharactersThe other set of Guns for hire are the characters which are unlocked as You progress in main story. This set of Guns for hire are specialists and can be added to your squad. They can be called upon whenever You need them. There are 9 of these specialists which includes 3 animals and rest humans. The human specialists include a sniper, an airplane pilot, a helicopter pilot, a crossbow specialist (for stealth), a missile man etc. You can form a squad with them or call them in separately.Skills:Unlike prior instalments, skills in FC5 can be unlocked by finishing challenges. The challenges (which can be viewed in Map menu) needs to be completed to get reward points. These reward points can be used to unlock skills. Some challenges (for example) are get 10 kills with grenade, 8 kills with knife throw, 20 Melee kills, 5 road kills etc. So, higher the game difficulty, completing some challenges might get a bit difficult as game AI gets better.Skills are similar to FC3 and FC4, not many changes here. One difference I noticed is, no more crafting for weapon bag, loot bag, weapon holster etc by hunting animals for skins. This too needs reward points now. So make sure where You spend Your reward points well. Weapons:Anything and everything from a knife to arrow, pistol to assault and sniper rifles, from Grenade launchers to guided RPGs. If You have DLCs purchased too, You get martian weapons as well. You can carry upto 4 weapons at a time, provided You have unlocked the large weapon holster by using those reward points.Overall I would definitely recommend the game.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 7/10Attention to details: 6/10Thanks for reading the detailed review.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;I've been a fan of Far Cry since the 3rd game, and was pretty excited for this one. I was not disappointed for the most part. As a fan of the series I have a lot to say about this game, so be preprared for a long read.PROS+ Looks amazing and is well optimized+ Soundtrack is great, including the radio songs+ Joseph Seed, the antagnoist, while not as good as Vaas or Pagan Min, is still good and really feels intimidating.+ Enemies actually have motivation and purpose, as opposed to the mindless pirates in FC3 or the braindead soldiers in FC4+NPCs have stuff to say now, they can tell you about locations, bases, hidden stashes, etc. Some even have conversations with each other that are fun to listen to, huge improvment from the old NPCs who were basically just there to be eaten by animals. The main NPCs are great and memorable too.+Lots more wildlife than the previous games, even have challenges to hunt them+Fishing is cool I guess, it's actually engaging and not an AFK activity like fishing in most games+ Planes and Helicopters are now in the game, and you can buy and customize vehicles instead of having to find them+ The bosses besides Joseph are more fleshed out and have their own methods and personalities.+ Companions are a new addition and are great, they never feel like a burden and can be instructed. Peaches is my personal favorite+ New resistance system is cool, you complete lots of varied activities in the world until you have enough points to face the regional boss and liberate the region.NEUTRAL~ I'm personally not a fan of the setting, I live in the U.S. so Montana isn't all that intersting to me, I'd much rather travel somehwere far away and exotic, however they do pull it off well, the atmosphere is great and I can see why people love it~ Co-op is an absolute blast however friends can't progress with you, you have to do each person's game twice~ Arcade is meh and most of the maps are player made and suck. Wish you could choose to only play Ubisoft mapsCONS- Hunting only yields you money, gone are the days of crafting upgrades, which is a huge shame, the old system was much more engaging.- Weapon variety is pretty bad, most weapons are just reskins of the same gun, even the unique weapons are identical to the standard versions, and they don't require anything to unlock, just more money, which is strange because the standard weapons are locked until you get enough resistance points, you can get the unique AKM before the standard one, it makes no sense at all.- Perks feel underwhelming compared to previous games.- Enemy planes and helicopters spawn way too often, feels more like a chore to kill them rather than and exciting battle.-No bladed melee weapons, I miss cutting people up with my machete/khukuri :(-Microtransactions for skins. Why was this necessary? It doesn't even cost much to unlock things with in-game money.Overall I think the game is good and definitely lives up to the Far Cry franchise, there are issues that bug me but they didn't ruin my experience. I think you'll enjoy this game, it's worth the full 60$, something that can be seldom said about games in this industry nowdays.;Recommended;34.2;31/03/2018;847;28
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;The Patriot simulatorI'll start with the bottom line: All in all, its 'yet another far cry game', similar to how FC3, FC4 and to some extent FC Primal look and behave.* Story (with no spoilers) - You're playing as a deputy who tries to arrest a cult leader that has taken control of a county in Montana. This cult is made of religious extremists who believe the end is upon us and they must 'cull the herd' aka kill the weak to save the strong and be ready for 'the collapse' which is their modern version of the biblical flood i guess.Things go to sh*t when trying to arrest him and you and your group end up in a gang-war type of scenario which you must survive till you find shelter. From there, the game actually begins just like any other FarCry game begins - You're saved by an npc that instructs you on how to start managing yourself in the map's sorroundings.Been there, done that.* Map - Roughly on the same size as FC3/4/Primal in terms of total size, but is much more condensed and has a lot more things to do in it. The game overall feels more of a GTA V's free roam when it comes to side-events that you find while traversing it. You will find lots of friendlies and enemies driving around and packed action is basically everywhere.events like hostage rescue are very common, as well as helping out npc's on the road with their random problems.* Followers - The game has added npc follower mechanic which works pretty well. You can add upto 2 specific followers with you and they can level up as they kill enemies to gain buffs. Most of these npc's are scattered across the world map and each has their own buffs, so finding new npc's as followers is a game of roulette that will either reward or screw you in terms of how good the followers will be. You have a total of 9 special followers that are story-bound, and countless of scattered npc's that can be used as random followers, which you can only 'store' up to 3 on your followers list. You can command followers to move to certain spots, kill specific enemies, and even revive you if you're dying. Long press to make them follow you again. Each follower has its own command key so they can do different things if you order them different actions.* Guns - You can have upto 4 gun slots in your inventory (3 big weapons + 1 sidearm) + 1 slot for melee weapons + your own fists which you can use at anytime with your actual weapon (similar to Duke Nukem's kicks in the classic game Duke Nukem 3D). There are a few dozens of weapons in the game, ranging between melee weapons, pistols, smgs, rifles, snipers, and heavy guns like lmg's and rpg's.* Skill tree - Works a bit differently than previous FC games. Its a mashup of badass ranks from Borderlands 2 and previous FC titles. Instead of steady xp gain, you get skill points on certain actions that you do, like completing missions and finishing world objectives and achievements. You spend the skill points on perks just like previous FC titles. All the ammo/holster upgrades are managed through this skill tree, so theres no more benefit in hunting animals for these kind of upgrades. Animal hides can be sold for money but that's it.* AI - Enemy's AI seems to have a small improvement from earlier FC titles. They will take more time to detect you and their aim wont be as punishing as previous FC titles (tested on the hardest difficulty). Follower's AI can be wonky at times, but overall its tolerable.* Arcade mode - An added minigame that lets you play with and against other people in 6v6 matches or in co-op mode against AI enemies like zombies/aliens/humans. There is also a feature that lets you build your own levels and play other people's levels.* Uplay - The obvious elephant in the room - This game has some issues with Steam, even if you buy it directly from Steam, since it forces you to have Uplay installed and tells you to create a Uplay account for it anyway. From my experience, there are a few issues while playing this game that you should be aware of, though your milage may vary:1) When opening and then closing the steam overlay in mid game, there is a slight chance (of about 20%-30%) that the mouse will stop responding. This has been confirmed to only happen in this game so its not a mouse issue. If this happens to you, tab out of the game and tab back in to fix it.2) The more annoying issue: When pressing shift+f2 to bring up the Uplay interface (the equalevant of the Steam interface), there is a good chance the windows' mouse cursor will appear (and stay stuck) in the middle of the screen until you quit the game (will start happening after leaving uplay's interface and going back into the game). The only proper fix i've found for this is to restart the game. Sometimes, switching to 'borderless' mode instead of 'full screen' helps, but its not a guarantee.3) You cant rebind the tab button, which means that if pressing tab in mid game, it will always pause the game and switch to the map view. Sounds nice, but since you can't rebind it, you have to put up with constant game interruptions if you want to shift+tab to the Steam overlay while already in a game menu, as doing this will unpause your game in the process. In other words, you will have to be aware to not be in an in-game menu screen when tabbing into the steam overlay.Im fairly suspicious that these 3 issues are caused deliberatedly by Ubisoft to make Steam users avoid playing the game via the Steam interface and encourage them to migrate into Uplay entirely.* Performance - The game runs at an avg of 80 fps in high-ultra settings at 1440p with Radeon RX 5700XT GPU and Ryzen 5 2600x CPU. No big frame drops seemed to appear and its overall well optimized in my opinion.As for the DLC's...Lost on Mars - A 6-7 hours campaign that puts you on Mars with Hurk. This is a really nice DLC with incredible graphics and superb futuristic weapon designs. Lots of action packed and overall highly recommended.Hours of Darkness - A 3.5-4 hours campaign that puts you on a Vietnam rescue mission. This DLC is quite disappointing as the objectives are very generic with no real incentive to explore the map. Its also fairly easy with the weapons they give you from the beginning. No sense of progress and all in all it feels really rushed.Living Dead Zombies - A very short 1.5 hours gameplay that is split between 7 micro stories that Guy Marvel is trying to form about (yet another) zombie apocalypse. You play the role of the hero in each of these stories and basically he forms them while you traverse it from the world he's building around you, similar to Borderlands 2's DLC with Tiny Tina (but with zero character build up). The DLC shows how Guy Marvel is trying to pitch 7 ideas to different producers for them to build a movie from.This is the most disappointing DLC of the bunch as it offers by far the least amount of content and priced the same as the rest. Give it a hard pass.So, which FarCry 5 version should you buy?The basic one. Period. I've bought the Gold one as i thought the 3 DLC's will give me lots of extra hours to grind on each, but the reality was that only the Mars DLC was worth it, both in terms of length and gameplay/story. Some other things i've recieved were free cosmetics and a few extra weapons and cars that pretty much screamed 'pay to win', alongside some fancy cosmetics. Since in game money isn't a big issue in the game, i simply can't recommend buying the gold version for these extra gadgets as you can buy them later on from vendors anyway.So to sum it up: Buy the base game and the mars DLC individually, when they're on sale. Pass on the rest.In summary:As said in the beginning, when you boil it all up, its basically 'more FarCry', which comes with all the good and some of the bad of the previous titles. So if you loved playing the recent FarCry games, you will sure love this, but it doesn't seem to add anything that is new to the formula.;Recommended;80.2;2/05/2020;192;5

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;Far Cry 5As a person who played through Far Cry 1 to Far Cry New Dawn I can say that this series had it's own falls and rises. And Far Cry 5 stays somewhere in the middle. Anyway, let's get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Cool partner system.+ Decent story. It was interesting at the start, boring in the middle and cool at the end.+ Stashes with cash are mostly interesting to solve.+ Clutch Nixon's challenges are really cool to do especially with a friend.+ Planes and Helicopters are really fun and good addition to the game.Cons:- There are some funny additional missions but most of them are boring.- Most of the additional and even main characters feel poorly written and not interesting.- It's mostly a game with the same mechanics and I don't mind it in some way but why remove good mechanics? For example, you don't need to hunt animals anymore because they only give you money for their skins and not an upgraded holster, etc like in previous parts.- If you play co-op your friend will not complete the story on their character which is some straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because my friend literally couldn't level up skills because the requirement is to kill a boss who we killed but it counts only for the host and he couldn't even buy guns because in his story he didn't reach a resistance level for it. I give this game a 6/10.Far Cry New DawnAnd I want to give a quick review of this game here as I didn't play it on Steam.Pros:+ Cool aesthetic design for everything. Map, animals, bikers, guns. Guns are especially cool.+ Really cool animations on silent kills. Made me wanna say "oof" for that poor guy who I stabbed in the eye.+ Story is a sequel of course. Simple and good I would say. + Sorties are especially cool and even unique to the series. Capturing a valuable bag and getting out in many different places is what I really enjoyed. Cons:- Partners are even cooler and funnier here but sometimes I don't get how they are so weak to instantly die from a lvl 1 biker.- Kinda short for its price.I give it a 7.5/10 but buy it on a sale.;Recommended;25.9;24/06/2020;457;11
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;I'm giving this a good review because I liked it and plan to play through it again for giggles, but I'm going to start by saying I don't think everyone will enjoy this.  Here's why I liked it:1.  Shooting mechanics are pretty tight and intuitive.  I know that's really basic, but if it's off in a FPS that just kills it for me.2.  I love the premise.  This setting and the idea of this game just jives with me.  I'm fascinated by prepper culture and cults.  Riding around in a pickup truck shooting guns at a bunch of psychos with my redneck buddies is just my idea of a good time.3.  They actually tried really hard to give this game personality.  Thing is there's not a lot of acting in the game, it's not an RPG, but what's there is really solid.  They took great pains to make it really look like Montana.  You will hate the villains and you will like the good guys (Poor Jess!). they did a lot with very little.  Also the soundtrack of this game is freaking amazing, and it looks really good.4.  I'm a working adult, I like games I can play for 20 minutes and get something done.  I also like story driven FPS.  This works for me.Here's why I think other people wouldn't like it:1.  Very, very loose approach to the narrative.  If you are one of those people who loses interest in a show when the characters do something that doesn't strictly make logical sense, or you lose your mind when you encounter a plot hole, you're going to hate this.  If you can just kick back and say "it's just a game", or make up the reasons in your head why something happened, (i.e. you have a strong suspension of disbelief like I do) you'll be okay.  But a lot of things happen that just don't make any sense, if that bothers you, you won't like it.2.  The multiplayer aspects didn't thrill me, though I like the Arcade feature, that one's good, the rest... meh.3.  The bullet drop with sniper rifles drives some people crazy.4.  A friend of mine who tried this thought it was more like an RPG, and while it has a few light RPG style elements, it's not an RPG.  It's a shooter with some character customization.I highly recommend you buy it on sale, even if it sounds good to you.   I mean I've played more money for worse games, but at least this way if you don't like it you're not out too much.;Recommended;220.0;17/02/2020;171;7

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 784,72;DISCLAIMER: I hate Ubisoft's open world games to an exponential degree and as such I had no interest in W_D2. However following the word of mouth, I got into the game a few weeks back. This review is for people who were burned by WD1 or just interested people in general  PROS: +Adapts a wider colour palette for San Francisco, ditching the depressing Greyish tone from WD1 altogether.+The option of completing the entire game non-lethally.+A casual, more light-hearted story that is self-aware and reflects upon the current Internet culture, with wacky characters.+Character customization is more diverse as opposed to the first game's preset clothing.+Radio towers, a plethora of collectibles and outposts have been removed altogether. +You have a lot more options with hacking. Call the SWAT on a NPC or place him on a gang's hitsquad. Cause a static vehicle to accelerate forward much to the surprise of the driver. This culminates in what people call Emergent Gameplay.+Online activities like Bounty hunter, Invasions and Co-op operations lend to longevity.+PC Version is also a significant step-up from first one. Favours numerous graphics options and a FOV slider. CONS: -Unsatisfying Gunplay. Customization of firearms is barebones.-Basic Stealth system. Cover mechanics is janky AF.-Braindead AI.-Vehicles controlling is more arcade-y. but improved from the first game.-Some rather bland mission designs. (Go to X, Hack Y, Watch a cutscene, Mission complete) VERDICT: Watch Dogs 2 came as a surprise to me. It got rid of a lot of stuff that Ubisoft is infamous for and opted for a better game world, the result is a far superior product than the previous title. It's not an absolute "OHMAGERD 10/10 GAYME HAS DOGES IN IT" that some people claim it to be but Ubisoft is making the right changes in its IPs, albeit little ones. If anyone is still on the fence after WD1, give this one a chance, you'll be fairly pleased.;Recommended;57.0;28/05/2017;576;15

Ubisoft;The Division 2;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 169,99;PSA To Everyone Wanting To Purchase This Title:   • Crashing Game has a terrible crashing issue for the majority of the player-base that's been going on for about 2 years now.People have tried fixing it themselves alongside Ubisoft Developers but all of the fixes seemed to be only temporary, a mere Windows Update or a Game Update could reintroduce the issue all over again, rendering the game unplayable for a lot of the players. (Ignore the trolls saying that it's a YOU issue, it isn't)  I've played the game on 3 different systems and I've had the same issue on all 3 of them, some better, some worse.There is an 8 hour trial of the game on Uplay, I'd strongly advise trying it out before purchasing as your system might be prone to crashing. • Ubisoft Connect The game opens up a "lite" version of Ubisoft Connect launcher in the background, I know some people don't like games which use third party launchers, so just throwing it out there.Furthermore, if you own the game on there, your progression is the same on Steam as long as your accounts are linked with one another.ALSO,  If you owned the Warlords of New York DLC on Uplay, you can purchase the Standard Edition of the game on Steam(without the DLC) and still have DLC within the game. • Potentially Slower Update Cycle? Game is mainly on life support, main team moved on to work on Star Wars/Avatar.Potentionally last year of support(Take this with a grain of salt, I am simply guessing based off of their social media) • Weird Paywall • Endgame locked behind a DLC paywall (Warlords of New York)If you decide against purchasing it you'll be stuck at level 30.  Positives:  • Decent time sinkEven after 1,000+ hours I've had things to do• A lot of different types of PvE activites of varying difficulties• Beautiful Open WorldBoth Washington D.C and New York have a ton of activities, collectables, etc..• Decent sense of progression• Good sound design• AI isn't dumbThey used to oneshot you across the map with a shotgun, they toned them down and now they're alright• Different types of builds with depth for different types of playersSniper, Shotgun, SMG, Skill builds, "Tank", Healer...• Pretty fair build making in generalYou can optimize and reroll gear as you wish with very few limitations• Works on Steam Deck (Disable DX12)  Mixed: • Bullet sponge enemiesIt isn't as bad as the first game and it's subjective to a lot of the things(Difficulty, what type of an enemy it is, your build)• Weak Story (It is a looter shooter, sort of expected)• Nerfs of "meta" gear, farming routes, yet hardly any buffsThere hasn't been any in a while, but it always felt like people in charge of this disliked players feeling powerful.• No AchievementsNot one I care about personally, but I see people complaining about it.If anything, there are achievements in game which grant you certain rewards.  Negatives: • No in-game matchmaking for RaidsThis wouldn't be such a big issue if there wasn't any gear locked behind this content.I also know some people just don't like going out of their way to find a group to do it with(Discord, Reddit...etc)• Performance could be better• PvP isn't its strong suit, and it clearly was an afterthought whilst creating the game.Current PTS changes have some interesting improvements in terms of it, but if you're buying this game and expecting fleshed out PvP experience, this game isn't for you.• You're sort of forced to purchase the DLC (WONY) if you want to do any of the actual EndGame content, there aren't that many players staying at level 30Final Thoughts & Would I Recommend The Game?Yes, without a doubt if the crashing is fixedIf you're serious about getting into the franchise, I'd strongly suggest getting the first game because it's an actual functional video game-Edit:  Will update the review if for some reason the Steam version of the game crashes less or at all -Edit 2:  Game crashed after 30 minutes of playtime, refunded -Edit 3:  I'll be deleting all of the comments which link old YouTube videos/Forum posts in the comments, it adds nothing to the conversation but misinformation.99% of these "fixes" are nothing more than placebo. -Edit 4: "So many negatives yet you gave it a positive review?"Yes, I did.I've spent thousands of hours playing/watching this game over the years, and it would feel unfair if I just completely disregarded all of that and went straight for the jugular.The game is fun and there is a ton of things to do/learn within it's world. (When it works)Considering the price tag of $18 for the whole package, this feels like a no-brainer decision.The main issue this game struggles with right now is the crashing, most of the other things can be ignored since they're prone to changing in the future (Like PvP for an example) -Edit 5:  Mr.Thunder  Consider making your own review rather than stealing this one, appreciate it.

Electronic Arts;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Action, Adventure;R$ 199,00;Sum up+ Level design with proper amounts of exploration.+ Lightsaber combat is both fun and a spectacle to the eyes.+ Beautiful graphics that capture the atmosphere of Star Wars.+ Multiple paths to reach an objective, giving room to freedom and exciting turns in platforming.+ The soundtrack further elevates the game. it always fit the situations and manages to convey emotions of the case.+ Enemies and bosses are entertaining, from dealing with a more significant number of stormtroopers to facing Sith lords in intense duels.- Some technical problems in terms of glitches and optimization.-Specific skills are poorly balanced, such as "best friends," which gives force meter each time a stim is activated.- The story is excellent, but it lacks those critical moments in the beginning and the ending. Could have used more content to flesh the origin of Cal Kestis and his journey entirely. Introduction Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. It follows the story of Cal Kestis, a Jedi who survived order 66 by hiding in a planet as a scrap worker. It features elements from multiples sub-genres in the action category and incorporates them to elevate its gameplay further. From lightsaber combat to climbing and soul-likes bosses, the game grabs a bit from each of the best titles but not to the point those mechanics would obscure its own identity. Gameplay The combat is simple but also is a lot of fun. It has vast layers put into it that can appear rather lackluster at first. Still, they are intelligent choices from the developer. Cal Kestis has access to his lightsaber for physical combat and the force to open his options. Lightsaber techniques can range from throwing it towards enemies before it comes back. Different combos or forms, while the force can range from pushing back grenades towards enemies, force pulling, slowing enemies, and more.Players have a ton of options when facing the stormtroopers. You can push them off cliffs, throw them into one another, reflect beams at them, or cut them down with parries, to name just a few. It gives the player freedom to how they will approach any encounter with them or try new ideas. Hurl something at them, put them in front of their own blaster, forcing them towards you. The game has a lot of  possibilities.The platforming aspect of the game is also again, a successful decision in design. There are multiple ways to reach an objective on the map. For example, you can get to the next goal, die, take another path, and achieve that same destination. What is great about this is that those paths are very different when it comes to traveling itself and that they reward exploration. You can visit areas in the order you want, even as far as to go to planets you are not prepared for or discover secret places to visit later.It borrows aspects from games like Zelda, Metroid, Uncharted, Dark Souls. It then incorporates Cal Kestis mechanics into them to make them unique to the game. Puzzles and exploration being limited until you unlock new abilities, platforming that involves using the force to expand one's reach. Approach to level design, and finally combat that mixes dodging, parrying, smart use of the force and lightsaber combat.It is rewarding to be able to visit prior planets and discover that now you can take that path that was blocked before. Enemies being added in locations and exploring side stuff such as collectibles or hidden ways. Enemies have a defense meter, like a shield of sorts and until the player doesn't deplete that they won't be able to damage them. The combat is focused on reaction to how the player reacts to the enemy's attacks and groups of them. All of them have unblockable attacks, and bosses are ferocious with brutal powers and agile movements. Strong points The strong points are its story, that while it has some flaws, it is an enjoyable journey and manages to captivate what makes Star Wars so great as a franchise. The gameplay doesn't get boring because of new enemies showing up from time to time, keeping it fresh, along with the variety of options the player has. Bosses are exciting, particularly the last ones are hard to beat, and they give intense duels.The integration of elements from other games is a concept that I like. Bringing a more refined quality in gameplay but also being careful not to let those elements get to carried away and making the game into a copy of those other games. Finally, customization while the ponchos and ship can be some recolors. the lightsabers have a lot of customization into them. All colors are present except for red. you can change the hilt. The material, the handle, just about everything about them, and let's be honest lightsabers are very cool. It allows one to personalize the aesthetics of Cal Kestis to suit their particular tastes. Story The plot revolves around Cal Kestis, a young man who works to earn his living on a planet controlled by the empire. The plot follows up after the purge of the Jedi after order 66, and Kestis being a Jedi padawan, spends most of his days in hiding. One day, however, he is discovered by the empire. After escaping certain death, he ends up meeting Cere Junda, a former Jedi who managed to escape the Purge of Order 66 and the pilot Greez Ditus, the Mantis ship's owner.Without spoiling too much, the story is good, but both the beginning and the ending of it lack specific amounts of flesh. The start of the game is sprung while the end is abrupt. However, the rest of it is rich in detail, with information on the planets that you visit, references to famous characters and events. Good pacing that allows for character development and for the player to get to know these characters.The exploration of planets adds layers to the lore game, especially if you already heard of them before. The story has the premises of a Star Wars film. Comedic moments that can give a laugh or darker ones that can emanate conflicting thoughts or uncertainty of how things will play out. It is fantastic and one of the best aspects of the game. Some Notes The games run faulty on a GTX 1060. it runs okay in a GTX 1070 and anything above that it runs flawlessly. I could notice that in 1060, there were a lot of frame drops, so I would not recommend it for GTX 1060 users unless you don't mind playing in 30 FPS, which is less than ideal. There are also some bugs such as getting stuck in a wall or BD never turning off the scanner light, but those were few, rare instances.UPDATE: So users report the game doing well on a GTX 1060, while others said it has lots of frame drops. In our experience, the game did not run well on a 1060 but it did on a 1070. If you have a 1060, you will have to try it yourself to see if it runs well or not. Conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is probably one of the best games released in 2019. While the game doesn't manage to make something revolutionary or unique, it certainly knows how to add other elements and taking them into what Star Wars means. The combat, while simple, has a lot of freedom build into it, and the platforming-backtracking is excellent.

Electronic Arts;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Action, Adventure;R$ 199,00;Jedi Fallen Order is, by quite a big margin, the most surprising title of the year for me, not only compared to the expectations I had for it, which were admittedly pretty low, but for how genuinely brilliant this game achieves to be.It's true, Fallen Order really looks like a greatest hits of all the major and most appreciated mechanics we've seen in single player videogames in the last few years: we have bombastic cinematic moments took straight from the Uncharted series (if you played Uncharted 2, you'll probably find the first hour of the game to be hilarious, in that sense), tombs with puzzles to solve and walls to jump onto that seem borrowed from the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy, a combat system very similar to what we recently saw in Sekiro by From Software but, thankfully, they never end up falling in the "been there, done that" zone and they always feel extremely polished and cohesively combined, returning us a fantastic experience that is far more than the sum of its parts. The level design by Respawn is also top notch, with an intricate map design that is both a joy to explore in every corner the first time, in order to find secrets and hidden optional enemies, and fun to return to once you unlocked those abilities you were missing and that you can now use to reach places you couldn't get to before. The difficulty is well balanced and, at the hardest setting, it gives you a nice challenge without resulting too frustrating: this is definitely the difficulty to pick if you're experienced with action games like Sekiro. The story is coherent and serviceable, enriched by a cast of interesting characters you'll most likely want to know more about (sadly our main guy isn't one of them, that is the one thing that never changed from my initial impressions). On the technical side the game is also very solid, with great graphics and an extremely polished PC port. the only issues I encountered during my playthrough were all due to the integration with Origin, which is something they really can't drop soon enough. All things considered, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a brilliant game that everyone should at least consider playing, even if they're not particularly interested in the Star Wars universe (I'm not a massive fan of the saga myself). Great job, Respawn!;Recommended;25.9;6/12/2019;479;28
Electronic Arts;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Action, Adventure;R$ 199,00;I am so proud of Respawn Entertainment.I don't want to discredit them whatsoever, when I say that I was worried EA would step on their toes and sabotage this game in order to prove the narrative of 'people don't want singleplayer games'Yet against all odds, they made such an amazingly wonderful experience that feels like a true, real game.This company is proof that there's life in EA, Filled with people who care if they would just be left alone to create experiences. I FEEL like a Jedi... not infinitely powerful, but, one who's vulnerable, scared, and learning to survive and thrive. I feel empowered. I feel rewarded. I feel like Luke... but I am Cal. And being Cal is a wonderful, beautiful experience, from the graphics to the music to the subtle world-building....

Electronic Arts;Battlefield V;Action;R$ 229,00;I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.I bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!Every single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??It's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!;Not Recommended;587.4;4/08/2021;2,192;72
Electronic Arts;Battlefield V;Action;R$ 229,00;Plagued by hackers, almost no oceania community, devs don't care, hackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still haven't been banned. Lazy.Edit: Wow this review got a lot more publicity than I expected! That being said, now that I've played a bit more I'd like to revise my initial thoughts. Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good game, the bullet ballistics are good, team work and strategy is good, the graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good. But all this is over-arched by critical flaws that I'm guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasn't likely to be as profitable as they were expecting. Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency. Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few "specializations" for each weapon, mostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things. The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers. They obviously knew their time wouldn't make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best. There's a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement. It's been abandoned, players don't get banned, reports don't get answered. If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield series, there's definetly fun to be had but heres a few tips:* Avoid official servers: that's right, the official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers. EA you should be ashamed.* Consider avoiding if you live in a remote area: In Australia today I was able to find just 1 conquest server with 40 players and able to at least play the game (10AM on a Wednesday). I really can't guarantee that there will be any player base if you live somewhere more exotic than Australia, USA and Europe are probably okay. Don't count on being able to find a server if you're a night owl like me.Overall this game had a lot of potential but it stands as a hollow shell of what it could have been. I liked the inclusion of female characters and being able to play as someone who I felt more of a connection to but the amount of hostility EA showed towards their player base was uncalled for and instead of making up for it they took the money and ran.;Not Recommended;54.0;29/06/2020;1,113;55

Valve;Dota 2;Action, Strategy, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.Let me put that into perspective:  541 Days and 16 Hours.  Of dota 2. I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was "addicted" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.But I've also relatively learned nothing.Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people,  because  of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: "what if I just did ... instead" or "what if I just played on a more casual level". The issue is, that dota  feels  more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.Thank you for all that you  have  done for me.

Valve;Dota 2;Action, Strategy, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you."Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.1. general thoughts and how i started:I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying "nothing" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts "lets learn music"  or "lets study" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of "improving" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of "oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.." at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat;Recommended;9,565.7;13/04/2018;828;100

In a nut-shell, I really love this game, here's my experience, spoiler free so far:The first 10 seconds were breathtaking, literally. I've been playing VR since 2018, a lot of games, and while the first moments of it were amazing, the feeling of presence went down a bit as I went along, playing more games. But this, this is something else. The attention to detail is amazing.Performance is fantastic, I don't really know how they manage to pull that quality and achieve steady 90 fps. That's a technical achievement for sure.As for world interaction / controls, they are the best they can possible be. I've played Boneworks and having physics everywhere is kinda interesting, but just as a concept. Going up a ladder in Boneworks or climbing was awful. The rest was good.HL:A merges the best of two worlds. There's physical interactions for moments where they are needed, but they won't get in your way at all. And I really love that, because is just a frigging game, not a simulation. For example, going up a ladder here, is simple. Opening a door too. It won't get smashed in your face, only features necessary collisions. Also I really love how they went all in and gave physic properties to some enemies. That increases immersion by tons!The hacking puzzles, I had my expectations low, but oh boy, I was really wrong. They are quite fun to do, they are challenging but not tiresome. They provide random patterns so the challenge always stay fresh.The sounds are amazing, I had to take my helmet because I thought a rat came into my room. Then I thought it was a faulty hard disk. Nope. It was the game. I believe the sound experiments they did with CS:GO carried over here and it really shows. Character voices were a bit loud tho.The Half-Life winks are amazing. And for someone who played them all, spent 10 years making a HL mod and basically kickstart a game dev career, it was tear inducing.My only complain is the ammo system. While I love the Tresspasser reference ("Two mags left!") I really wish I could store back some pistol ammo. I thought that was going to bit a bit more arcade-y, but it's okay, it really helps to build up some tension.I was going to try the game for a bit, ended up playing like 5 hours straight. Couldn't really put it down.The upgrade system is a nice addition. Also for the different enemy types. It's an evolved Half-Life in every way, and is what I expected and much much more.Now, I will get a bit sad for other companies, because they set the bar incredibly high.AAA VR games will be like this, or better, and can't say how really happy that makes me.Go and play it right now and be part of history as this is the VR break trough everybody expected.;Recommended;49.5;24/03/2020;2,321;372
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;Valve made me spend almost 400 dollars to play this game and the worst part is that its worth every penny;Recommended;42.3;12/12/2023;595;75
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;Half life Alyx is the best reintroduction into the Half Life universe possible.  Even though Valve says this isn't HL3. this most certainly is.  I played with a Oculus CV1 comfortably. Even on low fidelity settings, the game looked beautiful. 13 years was definitely worth waiting for this masterpiece. Unfortunately, My Father, who introduced me to the half life series, passed in 2016 to brain cancer and never got to see such an amazing title and what the future of gaming will be.  I love you dad.;Recommended;17.1;20/04/2020;808;33
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;Valve casually releases the best VR game and disappears again.;Recommended;16.2;21/02/2024;426;60
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;I can barely form words after the ending of this game. I will never spoil it for people who have not gotten there yet, so I wont go further into it.This game is a literal masterpiece. From the visuals, to the music, to the story that leaves you questioning everything, Valve has managed to create a VR title set in the Half-Life universe, that rivals all other Half-Life titles. Valve, Half-Life and their other titles saved me from a very dark time 13 years ago. And every Valve title that comes out I give my full attention. This game brought back the feelings of mystery, wonder, and concern on how my favorite characters were going to end up. Even with the knowledge of future events, as this is a prequel, it left you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The story was brilliantly written, and no one could have for seen where it was going. A pivotal roll in Half-Life's overall story and a must play for any fan of the franchise. The graphics were absolutely stunning, and the Source Engine has been changed for the better. Comparing Source with Source 2 is like Source Gold with Source. Stunning difference! Physics are still wonky from time to time, but this made me appreciate it even more. Just like old times!Valve seems to already be on top of patches, so I'll leave the little bugs alone as they have been updating it pretty often over the last few days.I have some issues with how it functions for lower end headsets, like the Samsung Plus, as grenade throwing can be a bit wonky with the controllers going outside the camera's zone. But I don't really think this Valve related per-say, though the amount of times you need to USE grenades could be a bit lower. But all in all, for a lower end Windows headset like mine, I don't have many grips. Controls worked flawlessly and all responded correctly. I used continuous motion but I did find myself using the Teleport to get to places quicker. So a nice medium mix between the two was my sweet spot. Lots of options to mess around with, especially if you get motion sick.I must point out the VAST amount of options you have available. Valve thought of a lot of people with this title to appeal to as many as they could. From Colorblind options to Light Sensitivity for people who suffer from Epilepsy. You can even play with one hand. Teleport, Smooth Motion, and Hybrids are BOTH options. So people who like either one, or both, can use what they are comfortable with. Valve just added Smooth Turning and they also have snap turning if it makes you motion sick. Play around with it, you'll find your sweet spot.All in all, for any Half-Life and Valve fan, this is a MUST! If you don't have a VR to play it, go grab a cheaper one and experience it for yourself. You DON'T NEED an Index to play this game! If you're sure VR is not your thing, go watch a play through on YouTube and support Valve to keep encouraging them to make more games like Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. They seem to have their spark back, and by the gods the STILL have what it takes to make masterpiece games.This final message, though I know they will never see it, is a Thank you to Valve. Thank you for making this game. Thank you for taking me back to a time where I discovered this series. And thank you for continuing to influence my life with all the things you have done for us! Please keep making games, and Thank you so much!;Recommended;46.2;25/03/2020;1,441;24
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;This is the best vr game I know of. This is an actual game. This is what vr is supposed to be.;Recommended;97.4;1/10/2020;605;11
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;About 3 hours in, I need to take a break. Here are my initial thoughts in easily-digestible point-by-point form:The game's tech outperformed even my pretty significant expectations. It's by far the best looking (and sounding) VR game I've played. Crucially, the image quality is fantastic, with absolutely no visible aliasing outside of very extreme cases of fine specular detail. And despite all that it maintains a pretty solid 144 (!!) FPS. Sure, I have a fast PC, but it's still a highly competent showing from the engine.The grabbity gloves are an absolutely amazing mechanic. The first 2 times I tried to use them it was a bit awkward, and my reaction was a slightly disappointed "hmm, that's it?". The third time it felt better. The fourth time it felt absolutely amazing. And from that point on I just grabbed and threw stuff around everywhere without even thinking about it. This is an extremely polished mechanism of interaction.The attention to detail is great. From startling the cat from the first balcony, over the extremely cool looking puzzles to the interactions with NPCs, to the major scenes, all of it looks like it had a lot of care put into it.Even Valve doesn't have access to magic. While the physics are better (more stable and more conducive to smooth gameplay) than anything else I've played, it's still not too hard to make things explode.Headcrabs. ♥♥♥♥ those.Overall, I can already confidently say that everyone who has access to a VR system should absolutely play this game.;Recommended;4.6;23/03/2020;2,007;73
Valve;Portal 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;The first Portal had genius, original gameplay mechanics, great story, great level progression, great voice acting, great characters, great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 1, you are a bad person.This sequel brings all those qualities to a new level: _the story is deep_, lots of wow moments, graphics is beautiful, much more levels, environments and elements to solve the puzzles, the co-op multiplayer is so fun it's epic.In my heart and in my mind I have no doubt: _this is the best game ever made_.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 2, you understand nothing about videogames.;Recommended;6.5;11/06/2017;2,977;93

Valve;Portal 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to sciencePortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to T2: Judgement Day when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.Pros+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this. +Stephen Merchant and J.K Simmons did an absolutely terrific job. Ellen McLain’s performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original!+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by Mike Morasky and The National. +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story. +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. Cons-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV.-Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.  The Bottom LinePortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson. perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer. Highly recommend it to……everyone. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try. My Rating: 10/10  Thank You :D;Recommended;31.4;28/06/2020;288;27

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 299,90;I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.  I found it was full of trolls.  Don't waste your time with Red Dead Online.;Recommended;127.7;14/11/2021;741;8

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 299,90;I've played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressive! And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law.;Recommended;362.6;9/09/2021;847;11

Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Action;R$ 99,50;Lucid, Organic, and Raw.feel free to watch this review in video form<<< click meMax Payne 3 and its presentation make it one of the greatest shooters I have ever played. Many other first and third-person shooters come off feeling stiff and artificial, no matter how esteemed the Game or Gameplay. There comes the point where we, as players grow conscious, realise that we are indeed controlling hardened tough guys, protagonists who may or may not let the odd grunt slip out of their inanimate lips upon taking damage. Max Payne 3 has made me realise that our Gordon Freeman's and Master Chiefs all lack emotion. visual and verbal feedback informing the player that they control a person, a living human being. Not a bunch of code that lets us sit on the shoulders of our favourite video game protagonists. Games lack moments that humanise the characters on the screen, Moments that, if included in a Game's design, Story, and Gameplay, would help grow the assemblage of 1 and 0s that the developers are trying to sell to us into real people. Max Payne 3 has these moments, and that is what makes it great. The Game's presentation and Gameplay are a trip - Lucid, Organic, and Raw. Playing the Game feels like a dream, literally. Everything feels so real, is so real. Max's fluid animations blend seamlessly into one another, dynamically reacting to player input, making the Game feel authentic and visceral. I find it astonishing how gunplay remains smooth and intuitive despite being so heavily animated -  the shooting mechanics are some of the best I've seen to date. it's just so satisfying. Shooting someone isn't something that just happens - it's impactful. You won't see enemies merely rag-doll after being shot. they react to their injuries, clutching their wounds, squeezing their eyes shut with pursed lips. every death feels unique, with a weight that is felt. A life that Max and I have taken. Perhaps that's just the Game's masterful presentation talking as it imprints on my mind, adding depth and subtle details that may not be there at all. Admittedly levels feel claustrophobic, and the Game itself is exceptionally linear, with many areas and battle arenas feeling limited. It would've been nice to see more areas like the Nightclub and the Airport that offer more room to move around. however, the levels have benefited from this design choice and are extraordinarily detailed with incredible fidelity. That aside, Max is a man in pain. I got that much. However, you don't just see his pain in cut-scenes, but throughout the Gameplay. Many Games fail to convey how the protagonist feels during the most crucial part of any Game. the Gameplay. They abandon the emotion. it's only allowed for cut-scenes and dialogue, right? Wrong.Max doesn't walk. He pulls himself around, dragging his clunky feet, always moving nonchalantly - even when he leaps into the air, there's no grace to be seen. Max ends up falling to the floor like a pile of bricks - struggling, as he staggers back onto his feet. The youthful nature seen in previous instalments made you feel like Neo from the Matrix. Now, It's all gone.Max's movements. they're unhurried. he's tired, he's in pain. Max is now the one looking to buy more sand for his hourglass, or perhaps he's waiting for it to run out? He's hanging heavy, desperately hauling himself from altercation to altercation - shootout to shootout. Through his animations and mannerisms, you see all of this during Gameplay - the feeling of pain, a man whose entire being has shattered into billions of pieces. He's lost everything, and you don't just see this during a cut scene of Max drowning his soul in liquor. that depressing, painful tone is slathered all over the Game. That tone is why Max Payne 3 is my favourite out of the entire trilogy. Max Payne 3 has been one of the best gaming experiences I've had in some time. It's a Game I see myself replaying for its visceral nature, fluid animations and gunplay. Like many others, this Game is a sublime work of art—the story and storytelling - Max's character progression. Sadly, we won't see a Max Payne 4. it's a shame as I have not felt as invested in a character for a long time. James McCaffreys went above and beyond bringing this character to life. And goodness, the music - Health made sure this Game had a soundtrack I won't be forgetting anytime soon. As mentioned before, Lucid, Organic, and Raw are the three words I would use to describe this Game. It's engaging and surprisingly intimate. unequivocally one of the Best Games I've ever played.Rest easy, Max. Thank You,removedmaterial;Recommended;15.0;28/12/2020;192;5

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 99,50;This is hands down the best detective game I have played. I love the noire style, and all the characters are well thought out and well written. There are a few problems with the core mechanics of the game, but they do not get in the way of the story. If you get Widescreen Fixer to fix the 30fps cap, the game will run like butter. I've only encountered one game breaking bug with Widescreen Fixer and it was in an optional side mission, and you can always just toggle it off at that point in the game. Pros:-Great story-Fun gameplay-Good acting-Likeable, well written charactersCons:-30fps cap without Widescreen Fixer, and even that isn't a perfect solution-Some small, but noticable glitchesOverall: I definitely recommend this game, especially if you can pick it up on sale4/5;Recommended;33.4;23/06/2017;219;5

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 99,50;L.A. Noire is a detective game, simple as that. If you're looking for another shoot everything rampage game like GTA just because this game is made by Rockstar then this is not the game for you. Sure there is shooting, but you won't be allowed to kill everyone in sight, running people over will affect your case rating etc. The Atmosphere	  Personally, I love the setting of the game, the late 40s jazz theme mixed with golden age Hollywood as well as a classic noir feel makes for a great mix, but while the storytelling is good, it's not all there. The story feels a bit like it's jumping around without finishing everything off, Rockstar gathered enough story for a movie, but not a 20 hour game. Because of this you will be left with extra things that feel like they are just there to fill up an hour of your time and parts of the story that are never properly concluded. This being said, the story has some great parts towards the second half of the game and does a great job 80% of the time, however the ending will feel incomplete.  Gameplay and Fun	 It's fun to drive around and using your siren to move people out of the way is great. The car chases are exciting at first but end up being repetitive, as with all the chases. Shootouts feel this way too and there are one or two that will feel boring. The combat tends to feel stiff from time to time. For an open world game it is very linear and the free roam mode itself actually takes some working out to access. Street crimes are fun to attend to and interrogations are challeging. The clue finding in the game is brilliant and walking around the crime scenes never gets old although you will quickly work out the set structure to finding all the clues. Sound	 The sound in the game makes for great immersion, no complaints here really. The hint sounds at crime sounds can be turned off if they make the game too easy and the whole feel of the sirens and the radio really sells the 40s atmosphere. Graphics	 The facial expressions are the best part about the graphics, I didn't notice too many hiccups in the graphics and if I did they didn't distract from the game. The faces of people look incredibly lifelike and all the other graphics are good too. The sunny setting of Los Angeles adds a bright feeling to the game. Replayability	 While you do have the option to replay your cases to get all clues and perfect your interrogation this game is likely to be one you will only play the story of once, it's still fun to drive around and do street crimes but the cases tend to be something that's best as a one time thing. Verdict	 Overall this game is great fun and a nice step away from GTA while still keeping to the Rockstart format. It feels fresh but also familiar. The graphics look very good for a game that came out in 2011. You will feel very immersed in the time period through use of sound and surroundings. The open world side has something to be desired and Los Angeles doesn't exactly feel as alive as GTA 4's Liberty City or Watch Dog's Chicago, it doesn't have much of a personality, the characters do. If you're looking for a good open world game, this isn't it, if you're looking for a good story with a mix of puzzle and regular shoot/drive gameplay and well designed characters then this is it. Get this if: You like a good story You want diverse gameplay that makes you think You like the Noir settingDon't get this if: You want full freedom in an open world You want to go on a killing spree You don't care about story  8.5/10;Recommended;20.5;2/11/2014;201;6

Activision;Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy;Action;R$ 184,00;The PC version of Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy offers all the content and patches found in the other versions of the game. On top of this, you get the ability to play at unlocked framerates, 4k resolution, native support for all major controllers (Xbox One / 360 / Dualshock 4 / Steam Controller) along with a move set for keyboard and mouse. If you’ve played the PS4 version, the multiplatform release brings a slew of fixes and one piece of additional content. A new level “Future Tense” which incorporates elements from an unfinished level found in the original Crash Bandicoot from 96’ – dubbed the “waterfall level”. Among the fixes are: Added the option to skip the intro that was unskippable on the PS4 version back when it launched. Added a new voice line for defeating a specific boss. Added a weirdly missing box in one of the levels.and most importantly, improved load times. Whether you install the game on a hard drive or an SSD the load times in the multiplatform release are between 5-7 seconds for each map, compared to the long 30ish seconds in the original release.I only have two complaints that I’ve found so far with the PC port:When you finish time trials you are greeted with a screen that lets you input three letters representing your name on a worldwide scoreboard. This input screen was implemented horribly. You must scroll through each letter fra A-Z with the keyboard. Instead of being able to type it…. with the keyboard. And it doesn’t remember the letters you’ve written, so you must do it each time you manage to beat your own time record.They’ve still managed to not add a restart button to the game map, so if you try to get a gem that requires zero lost lives, you don’t get the choice to restart the map, if you were to die. To restart the level you must exit the level, return to the hub world, choose the level again. Instead of using the restart functionality, that is already available in time trials. Now this is not as bad as it was in the original release, as I’ve said, the loading times are far better now, it’s still just weird they didn’t decide to add this, when the functionality already exists in the game for another game mode.In spite of this, I whole heartedly recommend the N.Sane Trilogy on the PC, as it is the definitive version of the game, and it’s shortcomings are few and far between.;Recommended;84.2;2/07/2018;253;4

Watched quite a few walk-throughs and tips videos.  I hated everything about it.  The I-frames, the enemy fight timings, the death mechanics, the Ogre...oh! that damnable, stinking ogre!  I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly.  Then about 20 hours in, I just got it.  I understood.  Then I was able to appreciate the landscapes, the quests, and the story line. I got my platinum in about 43 hours.  I've played through about 38 times, conquered all DLC gauntlets, and still love playing it.  I can now do a full run through in about 10 hours if I play all the side quests and kill all there is to kill.  Still hate the Headless though.  1007 hours and still love it.

Activision;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice;Action, Adventure;R$ 274,00;I was bored, and saw that this game won game of the year, so I bought it.After playing this game for two and a half hours, dying repeatedly to the game's first mini-boss, I contacted steam and demanded a refund for a game I simply couldn't play....but I couldn't get it out of my head.I got the game again for Christmas, and after finally killing that first mini-boss, I couldn't get over how I felt. I kept going, perfecting the fighting style until I reached the game's first real boss. It knocked me down again. I fought that boss over and over again until the swordplay became a lethal kind of dance. I felt invincible. After the first boss, I went onto the next one, and the next, until I completed the game's first ending. Then I played it all again, exploring the abilities, fighting styles, and story arcs that I hadn't tried before. I reached the game's truly final boss and killed it in one try because the game had trained me to fight so well. It was by far the most rewarding experience any video game has ever given me. After over 150 hours, I earned every single achievement.From someone who refunded this game the first day they played it, from someone who would have never been remotely interested in Japanese culture otherwise, let me tell you that Sekiro is one of a kind. Not only is the combat an art-form in and of itself, but the story is moving and the characters compelling.If you buy Sekiro, don't get frustrated when you hit a wall. Don't look up cheese strategies or try to savescum the game. Get back up, watch a walkthrough or two if you really need to, and vault over that wall like a f***ing shinobi.

Activision;Spyro Reignited Trilogy;Action, Adventure;R$ 184,00;One of my fondest memories of Spyro was eating a chocolate orange while playing Ripto's Rage during summer. You know, the kind you have to smash on the table to break them into slices? My mom brought it for me and it was pretty damn good.Twenty years later, I'm 31 and mom's not here anymore. But Spyro is. And the updated graphics still look how I remember, because our kid imaginations would fill in all the gaps to create a beautiful landscape. And it's pretty damn good.

Activision;Spyro Reignited Trilogy;Action, Adventure;R$ 184,00;One day many years ago. Me and my friend decided we were going to boot up Spyro 1 and play through the entire game in a single night. We went to the living room, had a bowl of candy and some pizza, and we started playing. Every time one of us died or finished a level we would switch off, we were laughing and talking about how much fun it was back in the day and how well it held up to that point in time. After several hours it was past the midnight hour. My friend started to get droopy eyes and just wanted to watch me play. I zoomed through some levels and got some secrets. Then I peeked over to where he lay on the couch. There he was, passed out, exhausted from the long night we had spent enjoying each other's company. I found a blanket from his room and laid it over him, before turning the tv and playstation 1 off. Then I quietly without a sound left his house and drove home. While driving home I sat in silence, grinning at the thought of what he would say the next day. "When did you leave?" "When did I pass out?". But I couldn't help but feel extremely grateful to have been able to spend time with a fantastic friend playing a wonderful game from our childhoods. This is obviously the beautiful remaster of the first 3 Spyro games. But I can't help but love the old time graphics and simple charm of the first original game. And I'm sure that memory plays a big part into why that is. Please play this game. Make your own memories. Smile just a little more than you normally do.

Activision;Spyro Reignited Trilogy;Action, Adventure;R$ 184,00;I played the old games on the PlayStation 1 when I was but a small tyke, so the Spyro games hold a special place in my heart.This remaster did not disappoint me. The games are still as fun as they ever were, whether you have ever played a Spyro game before or not.I'll add more stuff to the list when I think of it. For now, here's the stuff:Here's the good stuff:+ The game is fun!+ There are a lot of levels, secrets, and collectibles which are fun to find (most of the time).+ There are many, many hours worth of gameplay and levels. I would say this game lasted me much longer than, say, Mario Odyssey.+ Controller support works fine, of course. Personally, I really can't imagine playing Spyro with anything other than a controller.+ Spyro moves in a responsive and satisfying way, pretty much the same as he always did.+ The models are very well done for the most part, Spyro himself being the best example.+ The graphics and lighting are great, and done in a stylized way that pleases the eyes.+ Spyro moves like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disney animation, and his voice acting is wonderful.+ The other animations in the game are also very good.Here's the bad stuff:- Some of the character models are a little uncanny, but that might just be me.- In some cases the camera is a little too close to Spyro, which can make some people (like me) occasionally nauseous or queasy.- The game is not that well optimised. The frame rate can tank if there are specific effects or entities on the screen (e.g. Spyro breathing fire while on a spinning blade in Hurricos)The game is, overall, amazing. My nostalgia goggles prevent me from liking it as much as the original PS1 games - that being said, I loved the old games and I love this game.A lot of time and effort clearly went into making this a high quality remaster of the original 3 games, and it is well worth the price.I highly recommend this game.;Recommended;35.6;7/09/2019;148;7

Load the extra save from the previous step and play Gladiolus and Ignis''s path in Chapter 13 after they regroup with you13. Play DLC Episode Prompto after Prompto returns to your party.14. Finish Chapter 13.15. Play Chapter 14 and finish the main game.16. Play DLC Episode Ignis.17. (OPTIONAL) Play non-story post-game content in Chapter 15.18. (OPTIONAL) Play Multiplayer DLC Comrades with friends.Why:The order I've given above is not in chronological order of events, Rather, the order I've given is a recommended approach to familiarize yourself with the characters and lore and gain a deeper appreciation for the main cast at each step. During the main game, read the character biographies in the Archives (found in the in-game menu). It sometimes explains things that happened off-screen, and is updated when significant events happen in the game.I will now explain in detail why I recommend the order above. Each of the following numbered points corresponds to the same numbered point above:1. If you're undecided about whether you should buy the game, the Demo gives you all of Chapter 1, which is a good opportunity for you to try the game's mechanics and decide if they are to your taste (especially the combat). If you've already bought the game, Chapter 1 is for you to get to know the main cast as they are "now". The supplementary material (the Brotherhood anime and the Prologue novella) will delve into their backstories a bit more. This means of course that the supplementary material actually takes place before Chapter 1, but I recommend playing Chapter 1 first - kind of like how in real life you meet people and get to know them as they are, and then once you've known them for a while, then you start to learn more about their past and their history2. This takes place before Chapter 1 and ends some time after Chapter 1. Noctis and his buddies are barely in the movie, but the movie sets up the world and lore - why Noctis and his buddies are doing what they're doing at the start of Chapter 1, and what's going on in their home city Insomnia while they're away. Pay attention to King Regis' motivations (try to empathize with him). In the movie's prologue, the white-haired boy is Ravus (he'll show up in the 2nd half of the game) and the girl is Lunafreya (Noctis' bride-to-be). If you can form an emotional connection with Lunafreya over the course of the movie, it will improve the emotional stakes of the game. The movie focuses on Nyx's point of view, but really the people you want to pay attention to (for the game's sake) is King Regis and Lunafreya. Also side note: Clarus (the shaven-head guy who's with King Regis) is Gladiolus' dad3. The real plot of the game starts here. At the start of the chapter you seek out Cor from the Crownsguard. Note that the Crownsguard is different from the Kingsglaive featured in the Kingsglaive movie. I initially confused this character with the leader of the Kingsglaive in the movie until I googled it4. The anime's "present" takes place while you're on your road trip around doing the tasks that you're told to do in Chapter 2, so this is a good time to watch it. The backstory of what happened to Noctis is a good way for you to understand why  Noctis is so broody. It's easier to empathize with him once you know the trauma he experienced as a child. Also, the little girl Iris in Episode 3 is Gladiolus' little sister and she shows up in the game.5. This takes place the day before Noctis and friends eave Insomnia to embark on their roadtrip. It ends right as they're going to the Citadel to meet King Regis (the opening scene of the game). I liked how it developed Noctis and Ignis' relationship a bit more, especially when Ignis recalls how Noctis' injury changed him. I presume this is the injury from the daemon in the Brotherhood anime. I believe that same injury is the one Noctis was still recovering from in the prologue of the Kingsglaive movie. This might help you understand Lunafreya's special place in Noctis' heart. At just 8 years old Noctis witnessed the death of his caretaker at the hands of a daemon and is himself injured. Presumably he is still recovering from this injury when he meets Lunafreya as a child in Tenebrae, which Noctis constantly has flashbacks to in the game. To meet someone so pure and loving like Lunafreya not long after his dark, traumatic experience with the daemon must have left a strong impression on him, building a strong emotional attachment for him to Lunafreya.6. Have fun. You might have heard that the sidequests are really unabashedly bad and of no consequence to the world/plot (unlike games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3). It's quite a shame because it's a such a missed opportunity, given how beautiful the Open World is to roam about in. SquareEnix probably just ran out of time or resources, and admittedly churning out well-written side-quests is probably the least of the concerns given the long development hell the game went through. Nevertheless, just take the sidequests and hunts as excuses for you to spend time with Noctis and his buddies. The more you develop an attachment to the 4 of them, the better the emotional payoff towards the end of the game and in the DLC.7. This DLC is about Gladiolus trying to get stronger so he can better protect Noctis. Not really much story development, but the combat is more skill-based and probably an interesting experiment on SquareEnix's part. If you like Gladioulus' combat style, you can unlock the ability to play him in the main game by spending AP in the main game's Ascension menu (it's under the Techniques tab). You can do this even before you play the DLC actually, but the DLC trains you better. If you finish the DLC it unlocks a new weapon (both Gladiolus and Noctis can use it) and ability for Gladiolus that carries over to the main game.8. The Open World is about to close off lore-wise soon. You can still play the Open World segment in the later chapters, but it's not lore-friendly because Noctis and his buddies are about to embark on a journey that leaves behind the Open World. You access the Open World through pretty much a game mechanic later on. I spent over 70 hours on the Open World before I finally moved on in Chapter 9. Think of it as time for you to develop your love for the main characters. The emotional impact of the linear Chapters 9-14 depend on this9. (See previous point)10. Enjoy the story!11. The game let's you choose a path but just finish Noctis' first because if you choose the other path you can't switch back halfway12. Nice plot revelation13. Massive backstory reveal14. Enjoy~15. Enjoy~16. Prepare for the FEELS17. For those who can't get enough of the open world18. Lore-wise it takes place between Chapters 13 and 14.

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;RPG;R$ 125,00;UPDATE: Finished everything in the game.Excellent port!Configuration tips:1) Turning off all NVIDIA extra graphics settings improves FPS by a ton. Hairworks is the most lightweight one though (costs about 2fps) and looks amazing so I kept that one on.2) The High-Resolution Pack works great on a GTX 1070 (on 1440p res), even though it lists minimum requirements as being a GTX 1080 Ti, and I recommend you get it if you run a resolution greater than 1080p, have a GPU with 8GBs of VRAM, and have the extra 65GBs of space for it.3) If you have performance issues remember to update your drivers. Both Nvidia and AMD have new drivers that include optimization for this game.4) IMPORTANT EDIT: I originally had a guide here on how to edit the .ini file to support a 144hz monitor. After playing a little longer I noticed some bugs I was having such as long black screens before loading and hunt posters staying on screen after turning the quests in. Turns out this was due to editing the .ini file. Please reset your .ini file if you are having issues after editing it from my guide or another. Edits other than framerate can cause similar issues too. I recommend leaving the file alone for now.5) The options you get when booting up the game "Television" or "Home Theater" don't affect your display, they actually affect your audio. It also had nothing to do with stereo or surround sound. It determines audio compression. If you are using low quality speakers select "Television" as it will sound better for you. Otherwise choose "Home Theater".Note: I know many are reporting random CTDs or frame drops but I haven't experienced a single CTD and the game runs smooth as butter for me staying between 50-60 fps even when encountering large enemies (i7-4790k, GTX 1070, 16GB 2133 DDR3 RAM, SSD).Game Review:PC Support - 9/10Performance - 9/10Graphics - 9/10Sound - 8/10Music - 8/10Story - 9/10Gameplay - 7/10Multiplayer - 4/10 (mostly dead by the time I got to it)Things I like:Story was great and the main crew are some of the most unforgettable characters in gaming.The setting is a mix of high fantasy and steampunk but where some characters just look like normal people driving cars and stuff.The summons and giant creatures you sometimes encounter are epic. Imagine fighting a boss the size of a mountain... so big the camera doesn't even function correctly.You're driving a luxury vehicle that transforms several times throughout the game.Whole game is very stylish.Things I don't like:The story won't hit like it should unless you experience the other accompanying FFXV media first such as Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV and Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV. While not as important it might even be worth it to play A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV and watch the Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV on YouTube.Episode Ardyn isn't included in this edition and it's the best DLC content.Side quests are some of the most boring unmemorable side content I've played through, reminds me of MMO fetch quests with no real story involved. I recommend skipping them even if you are a completionist.The high level challenge dungeons are just seemingly endless copy and paste floors of enemies, don't bother with these either.Unlike others I don't have a problem with the combat, I have a problem with the difficulty. The game is way too easy since you can just buy and carry ridiculous amounts of healing items. I later found out there is an easy mode but not hard mode which is just absurd. Definitely play with the hard mode mod from the Nexus even if it's your first time playing.The brainless minigame "Justice Monsters Five" is way too easy and therefore way too long and boring however if you play it long enough you can get some great items from it at the beginning of the game.;Recommended;132.0;7/03/2018;509;11

I felt happy playing Final Fantasy 15. I wasn't just running around with "my party members". I was spending time with my friends. I did every side quest I could find.

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;RPG;R$ 125,00;Spoiler-free review:[DISCLAIMER]I do vaguely critique on the story's development. If you wish to dive into the game without knowing any sort of pacing-related topics in terms of the game's story, do not read ahead. or just skip the next paragraph. However, I do not give out any specific spoilers, so rest assure.[STORY]Now, after beating the main story for myself, I will say one very important thing about the pacing of the story: the chapters feel very rushed toward the end, and it felt like each few sections of chapters within the game were developed, or written, by different people, Not to mention the numerous plot holes that were in each chapter, especially towards the end of the game. It goes from semi-dynamic gameplay to dynamic, and then to linear, which is absolutely disappointing. During the dynamic portion of the game, you can start and finish many side-quests, dungeons, or just power level via fighting monsters and bosses. Then, when you decide to progress through the story, about three-fourths of the way through progression, the game just decides to throw you into a linear structure of gameplay, which you will notice after about five minutes of playing through it. To conclude the topic of the game's story, let me say that it started it out pretty well, then escalated into something worse, but manageable if you don't think too critically about the plot holes, or why they developers decided to do what they did.Nonetheless, I still loved the characters, especially the main four and their small interactions during the open-world sequences.[DLC]So, at long last, I have finished all three DLC's. My experiences with Episode Gladiolus and Prompto differ from Episode Ignis. I didn't dislike any of the DLC's. however, I thoroughly enjoyed Episode Ignis a lot more not just because of the better combat mechanics, but because the story from the full-game is actually redeemed in a way through playing this DLC. The way they handled this DLC was pretty genius, and if you play through it, you might think the same. I can't say why exactly without giving out spoilers, so I'll stop talking about Ep. Ignis here. Each time the three DLC's were released, they got better and better. Episode Glad was a bit weak in terms of content, but explained what happened during a certain part of the main-game's story. Episode Prompto was very good in developing Prompto's character, but was weak in gameplay. There were moments during combat where I was getting a bit frustrated with how weak I was against the enemies. The mechanics were cool, but it felt like I was playing a third-person shooter made by Ubisoft.My overall thoughts on all three DLC's: They were very good in terms of story and character development. some could use tweaking in gameplay mechanics. and beating each DLC can give you extra items/weapons/fashion in the main game which is a plus. Although they felt weak at times, I liked all three of the DLC's. I believe they added onto the main game's story plot points quite a bit, which makes them more than worth playing.[GAMEPLAY]{Played this game with a Playstation 3 controller}I will try to keep this short and start off by saying that the gameplay is amazing! No, the combat is not turn-based, although you can enable the "Wait" combat function in the options at any time, which gives you a slight feel of the combat being turn-based. I decided to play without it, and I had a blast. My only gripe about the combat is that you can't freely use magic. You have to create it by absorbing three types of elements: electricity, fire, and ice. With these three, you can create a spell, which usually comes in a stock of x3 or x4. Furthermore, you can add a fourth item from your inventory which gives the spell more potency and effects. It's not so bad once you get used to it, but I still do wish you can use White Magick or Black Magick like in the older games. [VISUALS]Another disclaimer: This is a budget gaming PC I created in 2015. so yes, it is on the low-mid end tier. CPU: Intel i5-3570k (3.4ghz, NOT OC'd)GPU: Gigabyte GTX 960 2GBRAM: 8 GB DDR3DISK: Game installed on Samsung 850 EVO SSD 250 GBOS: Windows 7 64-BitOkay, so after testing various graphics settings via playing the demo before the full-game release, I ended up playing the majority of the full-game in the "High" setting with the scaling set to 100%. As many of you would expect with my specs, I did end up with a few problems here and there. After beating certain parts of the main story, I would end up running into a cutscene with about 10-20 frames running, even after the cutscene ended. So, I would be playing at the said frames unless I restarted my game. The same problem would sometimes happen after I perform a summon. Because of this, towards the end of the game, I switched to the "Average" graphics setting and I was mostly fine from there. There was one immersion-breaking moment that happened in a certain cutscene during the final hour or two of the game, where Noctis was invisible, but it was a rather short and less-important cutscene, so I was okay with it.On the "Average" settings, I was getting about 45-60 frames with a few dips here and there, but I did end up beating the game without the frames ever being locked to 30. So here's a tip from me: play this game with a graphics card with more VRAM than me. or just have a better machine than mine, which I'm sure is the case for many of you. I just thought I would add this section for the few that have rigs similar to mine. Final note, don't enable the last four "NVIDIA" graphics settings because those destroy your frames, even if you have an a slightly better setup than mine.[LOADING SCREENS]Okay. So, If you've played this game on a console after the initial release in 2016, you know how excruciatingly long the loading screens were. If you install this game on a standard HDD, you will get the same effects. However, if you install on an SSD, the longest you will have to wait is about 30 seconds. The average time it took for me to sit through the load screens was about 3 to 15 seconds. That's it.So try to install on an SSD if you have one. I moved a few of my steam games over to my 4TB HDD, just to install this and it was worth it. [As of 03/10/2018] On my end, this game is about 83.3 GB's, so maybe use that as reference to find some space.[VOICE ACTING]I don't mean to start a war over "Sub vs. Dub". I appreciate both languages.As a Japanese-American who fluently speaks and comprehends both the English and Japanese language, I played the entire game in Japanese, with English subtitles. Thank you Square Enix for adding that function to almost all of your newer games! I have watched a few Twitch streamers and YouTubers play the game in English, and I have to say both are very good. However, there were very key differences in the acting. Once again, let me state that I am not being biased because I'm Japanese. I believe I have a pretty good understanding of the level voice acting displayed on both sides of the spectrum. Now, my thoughts are that some of the characters' voices in English are a bit jarring at times. Since writing some of my specific critiques on the voices would end up riling some of you, I will avoid in doing so. However, I will say that the Japanese voices fit perfectly, and I had no problems at all.It was interesting, though, to hear Cindy talk in Japanese. In English, she has that southern accent, but in Japanese, she just speaks using standard Tokyo dialect. No complaints though. Also, the localization of this game made it so the subtitles are following the English voices, not Japanese. So if you play with Japanese voices, know that not all dialogue is the literal translations. Steam's character limit is preventing me from so much more explanation, unfortunately. Sorry.Edit [03/20/18]:- Added review of the DLC's- Cleaned up and fixed points in review- Removed review's "Conclusion";Recommended;122.1;10/03/2018;268;8
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;RPG;R$ 125,00;FFXV is such a paradox. On one hand, it is such a flawed game. flawed in its core fundamentals - empty open world, middling and slightly repetitive side quests, weak narrative structure (can i just say, i adore the FFXV lore? why is it not in the game???). but somehow, all these things become bearable because i have the company of 3 extremely lovable, adorable, and memorable companions/party members. i will slog through endless walking in a barren field to kill 5 enemies because i want to hear noctis mistake prompto for ignis during their linkstrikes. i'll drive (also known as the most boring way to traverse an open world i've ever known) just to do prompto's lil photo spot side quests. i'll cook in campsites so gladio can have his cup noodles. YOU GET IT. the 4 main characters make the game shine, and if i'm being honest - hold every flimsy mechanic together. so, be prepared to cry your eyes out whenever you hear stand by me after beating this game because for fk's sake, it's been 5 years and i know i sure do get teary eyed when that song plays.;Recommended;79.4;28/06/2023;171;3
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;RPG;R$ 125,00;This is a tragic game.  There are signs that this was supposed to be the greatest game ever.  If I showed you cutscenes and gameplay, you'd think they look spectacular.If I described armigar, warp strikes, chain strikes, etc, you'd think it sounded intense.If I told you the bullet points of the story, you would think it sounded intriguing.  It was going to gather together numerous elements of the entire final fantasy series into one complete and spectacular legend.Something went wrong, maybe it didn't get finished.  Pieces got sewed together.  There is no flow, no pace, no bridging any of it together.  Massive plot points are simply mentioned.  Gameplay gets tiresome as you just wail on enemies and getting higher powered just means it takes 20 seconds to kill a bad guy instead of 40.  It's fine for RPG combat, but it's not fun enough to carry exploration and other content.  Speaking of which, optional content is the worst part.  HOURS and hours of this game can be described as fetch quest 1-10, picture quest 1-10, animal gathering 1-10, Hunt monsters for gil etc.  Minimal dialogue, no development, and no point except money and wasting time and making you wonder what you are doing with your life.  You need an RPG to have character development, interesting plot, interesting themes, suprises, warmth and heart.  The sidequests are empty and frustrating.  It's probably wise to leave them when you have had enough.  However, every once in a while during the main story you are whisked away for a few moments and forget how bad it was for the hours wasted in between cutscenes.  Sometimes it feels totally worth it.  Some additional thoughts:  I watched Kingsglaive and the brotherhood miniseries before playing, and they went a long way to helping me enjoy the game.  Watching them all before playing any of the game wasn't confusing.   Playing the game in english means that your buddies will say dorky things, maybe playing in japanese can insulate you from that (assuming you can't tell the difference between dorky and cool japanese) The game in its current form is about a C+, I'm glad I played it.  I just regret that I never get to play the game it was supposed to be.;Recommended;170.5;21/09/2018;358;8

Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;Incredible game that was ahead of it's time and brought parkour, combat, and single player all together perfectly.

Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;Overview This is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet. Story The storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.Level Design/Graphics Speaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point. Gameplay Last, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints. Conclusion Should you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.;Recommended;11.5;18/06/2017;169;4
Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;I bought this game during the 2017 Summer sale..... and I beat it the day I got it. This is probably one of the best games i've ever played, and i've beat a good few. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new game.

Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;While I've seen many people who disagree, I think this game is magnificent.  The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well.  While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions.  There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations.  They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone.  I've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree.  She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game.  What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic.  My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream.  Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still.  Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary.I've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around.  Yes, this is true, but think of it this way.  She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going.  Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating.  She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating.  Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury.Now, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply.  I've played through the whole game twice the first three days I had it, and now I'm going in for a 3rd time just because I love it so much.  Enough said?Also, graphics?  There's a graphics option just for the quality of Lara's hair.   I think that speaks for itself.  It also absolutely KILLS my framerate when I turn it on, too.  My PC is decently powered too, frames are really smooth otherwise.;Recommended;77.7;21/07/2014;165;1
Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;"You can do it, Lara. After all, you're a Croft"Review made by a huge Tomb-Raider fan. This is the reborn, the first story of our favourite adventurous girl in the world. The game has a lot of good and bad aspects, let's review them!✓ Prequel connections: if you are planning to buy both Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider I would play this first as you are gonna find several references to Yamatai and Lara's friends in them. It's not necessary at all to play this game to understand future Tomb Raiders, although the experience is way better if you read all the documents you find on the island.✓ Graphics: one of the most visible changes for all the players. an important, great and well-done change with a beautiful enviroment, great lighting and character models. We cannot forget the TressFX mode which allows you to make Lara's hair more realistic and beautiful (back in 2013 this was something incredible)✓ Gameplay: you can jump, run, tumble... Map design is cool as it allows you to explore the whole area✓ Play time: you have hours of entertainment in front of you... Did you just finish the game? No problem! Now you can try to obtain all the achievements, hidden tombs, upgrade all your guns... However, as you have no elections during the story nothing will change if you replay it✓ Animations: sometimes it feels like Mortal Kombat because of the brutal killing animations with both your pickaxe and bow. You can also crush your skull against a rock (which looks painful)✓ Armory: hit an run. Use your bow (it feels great to use it) and go Arthemis-like all around the map, or just make everything explode with your shotgun. The game offers upgrades so you can make them deadlier, which feels nice and is actually very useful✓ Feels: possibly the best feature of the game. You are probably going to fall in love with Lara because you'll see her origins. If you are a TR fan or if you have played old Tomb Raider games it's worth to mention that this story is "not going to make any sense" because it has nothing to do with them as this is her very first adventure[/b], that is why we see a softer version of Lara✓ Skills: you have a wide skill tree in front of you that will help you to both kill and collect more stuff✓ Collectables: lots of them! It makes the game very interesting and it gives you plenty of additional game hours (+achievements, of course)✓ Map: you have a very big map to explore! (bearing in mind 2013 standards!) You can always use the quick travel feature in the bonfires, which is great if you are looking for those sweet collectables and achievements✓ Fans: got stuck? Not a problem. The Tomb Raider fanbase is huge and we're (generally) very friendly. You won't have trouble finding several guides and artwork for this game, so I would call this game a good introduction to the saga for new players arriving to the Tomb Raider world~ Story: being a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series: no, it's not the best story ever made, although it's not that bad. It feels like an action movie though, both enjoyable and interesting, although if you want to play a Tomb Raider with a good storyline I focus my attention in both Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider✖ Resources:  you'll end up having lots of unused resources. For instance, hunting isn't rewarded, it's a one-time thing done to complete a mission, but something totally skippable in the rest of the game. Not having to hunt to survive is missed, but something that may be good for those players who just want to focus on the story✖ Multiplayer: dead mode, a serious waste of time as no one plays it. The worst part about it is that you cannot obtain its achievements✖ Especially for those old Tomb Raider fans: this game is very easy compared with the old games from the saga. That doesn't mean you don't have to think to solve the puzzles, but if you have ever played an old Tomb Raider game before you are gonna notice the differenceConclusion:Definitely worth the price. You can find an enjoyable and cool triple-A game for 2€.If you want an introduction to the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft world, I would call it a must-play as it is the origin of the prequel which will be (sometimes) referenced in both Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.;Recommended;31.5;30/07/2015;314;21
Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;Great game, The story is well constructed with irreversible events. The gameplay is just great, I felt like I was playing Assassin’s Creed mixed up with Uncharted!;Recommended;5.7;4/08/2020;67;N/I
Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;Do you remember Lara Croft? That femme fatale from a certain adventure series? You know, the buxom beauty that has a starring role in nine games, two films, and countless other media? She's the one with Barbie's warped proportions, Batman's agility and cunning, and whose confidence and grit are as palpable as her impressive dimensions? If you do remember, then you certainly haven't played the latest Tomb Raider series reboot by Crystal Dynamics. After playing this game, you will have forgotten everything you know about the old Lara Croft.This new and younger Lara is vulnerable and uncertain of herself. She cries and shows genuine sorrow when she loses a friend. She laments killing animals that she hunts for sustenance. Her every physical action painfully reflects her lack of experience, her desperation and dread at the seemingly insurmountable odds laid before her. Yet she perseveres through her story, dealing with the physical pain and emotional anguish, and grows all the better for it. Lara goes on a tremendous journey, and takes us right along for the ride.The story kept me interested throughout, action was pretty intense and didn't feel over the top or overused. I really liked the character development of Lara and her progression towards becoming that bad ass chick from the original games. I noticed some people complained about narrative and story not making sense, noticeably during scenes of Lara being upset and all of a sudden on a so called 'killing spree', I felt that the developers did as a furthering of character development in such a way so that Lara had to always be on her toes so to speak. Those reviews seemed to have a bias or an unwanting/not caring to understand Lara's journey so don't let them put you off. Graphically a beautiful game to witness, I had to slow down at times just to catch some cool shots of the island in its various weather conditions. Cinematic scenes, just wow tbh. The use of weapons was well integrated into game play and non seemed unnecessary, the bow is one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in recent games and it almost feels wrong when not using it.To sum it up, just buy it. It offers an enjoyable experience regardless of whether you're familiar with the older Tomb Raider titles.;Recommended;23.1;2/12/2013;959;2
Square Enix;Tomb Raider;Action, Adventure;R$ 4,49;AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Tomb Raider Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Action. Adventure. Atmospheric. Third-Person. Gorgeous Graphics. Story Rich. Cinematic My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-18 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre. Those intrigued by the genre. Fans of the intellectual property. Aesthetes. Strong narrative advocates. Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWTomb Raider (2013) is absolutely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.  The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience.  There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun. unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players).  Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres.The graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality.  This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU.  Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience.  This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes. as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore.  This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up.  It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie.The gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients.  There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories).  There are “puzzles” to solve (a la classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover.  Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun.  Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels—all the necessities are there.  And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios.  There are also high adrenaline “escape” scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building.  Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game.The game runs on a checkpoint system.  I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless.  Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don’t have to recollect them.  Also the checkpoints are extremely common. so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up.  There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign).Lastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign.  I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun.  Unfortunately barely anyone plays it.  Although, like most games, it isn’t completely dead. you will be able to find some people on here-and-there.  There is a high percentage of cheaters, though— which is also common for low-population multiplayer games.  In short, I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game.So, in summary,  Tomb Raider (2013) is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience.  It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics— a truly “top-shelf” game.  I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences.   Even if this style of game isn’t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!;Recommended;34.7;11/09/2015;449;35
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;Feels like they've lost touch with their fans. They don't seem to understand what made Just Cause 2 so great. JC4 feels like a really emotionless entry to the series that continues to depend on gimmicks to try to get players attention instead of having an actual fun gameplay loop.If you love the series because of Just Cause 2, play that game or buy this one if it's heavily on sale. If you liked Just Cause 3, this is basically worse than that game.Things about this game i'm bitter about: No dual wielding, no grenades/c4, grapple reliant puzzles/objectives, lots of escort & defense missions, lots of terminal hacking in every base, no weapon/character upgrading at all, vehicle handling is terrible even the helicopters, the graphics somehow got worse from JC3. I could go on but I won't. This game really dissapointed me.;Not Recommended;11.5;6/06/2019;736;15
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;HOLD ON THERE STRANGER, SCROLLING THROUGH THE REVIEWS! HEAR MY WORDS, AND LET ME TELL YOU A TALE: A TALE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND ANGER. LEND ME YOUR EARS, AND LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU...I've played a TON of JC2 and JC3, so I was excited to try Just Cause 4. I saw all the negative reviews, saying how it's trash and all that. But I thought, "Hey, I'm going to give it a fair shot. I don't really care about graphics, as long as I'm just having fun." So, I bought it at full price, and booted up the game, excited to cause some delicious mayhem!I wanted to like this game. I really did! But I did not. NOT AT ALL.First impressions went something like this: "Okay cool, bad guy likes weather. Wait, where are my attachable C4's? Maybe I unlock them later. Explosions! Huh. They seem pretty lack-luster. I feel like JC3's were better. Okay, well at least I can shoot these guys up. I'll just find some pistols a second. (20 minutes pass) Are there no PISTOLS? PISTOLS?! Okay, what about grenades?! Please tell me you at least have some dam GRENADES. It's like a staple in ever action game ever. No? *sigh* I'll just continue this boring mission. Wait, where am I going? Oh, okay over there at that tiny marker. I'll just grapple over there and- Woah what? WHAT THE F*CK DID THEY DO TO MY GRAPPLE?  MY BABY! okay, this is fine. I think I can live with this? Now I gotta go meet with some dude and stuff and... what is even going on?! I'll just open my map, and... What. The. F*ck. Is. THIS?! WHAT KIND OF MENU IS THIS? Stay cool. Pretty soon, it'll become natural (it did not btw). Okay, finally. I can customize my grapple. Maybe I can fix it or something. Nope. Alright, well now I can add balloons and stuff. So I have to go to this menu, into that sub-menu, into that tab, into that selection, and then choose the addition, and then choose the specific type of addition (while holding down a key and cycling through them only with another random key) and... these are the worst controls. You know what? IO'm done. I'm F*CKING DONE WITH THIS BS!" *closes game and goes into steam to order my refund.(Also, there are only sport cars on the roads, so it doesn't feel special when you drive one. And, the cars are way too boring. Also, the controls for driving SUCK A*S.)I should also note that the liberation system that has been some of the best parts of the series is now gone, and replaced with a stupid squad system that you have to earn and unlock, and it's all just very confusing. Trust me.In summary, this game seemed to say, "Hey, if we just slap the Just Cause logo onto the front of it, people will buy it! Don't worry too much about gameplay or the fundamental fun parts about the previous games. It's all about that sweet, sweet revenue." It pays too much attention to the small things like radio songs and customizing how fast a balloon inflates than the basic point of a game. TO HAVE FUN. As I said before, I'm disappointed that I must write this negative review, but it's just a bad game...NOTE: HOPEFULLY, PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ THIS REVIEW AND DON'T BUY THIS GAME.

Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;Just Cause 2 and 3 were as perfect an example of great games as you could find, Just Cause 4 however, is the ugly lovechild of lazy developers(Avalanche) and a greedy Publisher(Square Enix).The game was released unfinished on release and 5 months later it's still a total mess.Pros:Big open World.Tornado is fun.More tanks!Cons:Random crashes on high end system.Random fps drops on high end system.No water surface physics.No Sun.NO Day/Night cycle (1 hour day/10 seconds night!)2D textures in a 3D game (see railroad tracks)Cutscenes are PS3 console quality.Ricos hair has white "dandruff" and graphically looks like console quality.Most graphic settings don't workAA is total rubbish and does not work.No Brightness sliderNo Gamma sliderNo FOV slider as promised.No PistolsNo C4No dual wielding gunsNo liberation.Save games get reset randomlyWorld is empty with very few destructables.AI is awful, worse than ever.Vehicle control is terrible, despite a driving dlc being released!Submenus are direct console ports, merely changing tethers can mean 7 keypresses!As you can see it's a long list of cons, many of which just are not acceptable in a $130 AUD AAA game from 2018/19.The game randomly crashes and when the last patch came out many peoples saves were reset(including mine).For reference i have an I7 6700k and 1080Ti, the game is so poorly optimised even i have problems.The game doesn't even require you to liberate zones, you simply do a mission or a few of the (awful) side quests/stunts to level up your squad and unlock new zones.This attempt at strategic JC gameplay can only be described as a "risk the boardgame" style strategy and fails hard.The game is more a management sim with missions, not the interactive, die Hard, over the top movie like experience we have come to know and love about the Just Cause franchise.Take it from someone who pre-ordered this as a HUGE fan of JC2 and 3, only to be let down by both the quality of the game and the lack of any real action by the developers.The tech support of the forum goes unanswered for weeks at a time and for many people the game crashes regularly or resets their save games.Buy it when its 75% off or avoid it entirely.RIP Just Cause and shame on you SE.;Not Recommended;56.7;24/04/2019;1,558;40
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;Plus Points:+ Absolutely stunning map. Best world design in the Just Cause series so far.+ Large variety of interesting vehicles and weapons+ Grappler tools are funMinus Points:- You can't liberate bases and settlements anymore. You can still blow stuff up, but everything you destroy will just respawn and doesn't count towards the completion of the game like in previous entries to the series. This makes destruction, which has always been the main point of the Just Cause games, completely pointless.- Instead of destroying enemy bases, you now liberate regions using "squads". You earn these for doing pretty much anything in the game, including blowing stuff up, but they are so easy to get you'll never be short of them. Once you have earned enough you can click the region on your map and it will suddenly be liberated. This means you can liberate many regions without even actually going there (for some regions you have to do a single short mission first). You can completely liberate the entire map without visiting most of it. And that is a shame since the map is so beautiful. The map is filled with interesting locations and well-designed enemy bases, but you have no real way or incentive of interacting with it. I do like the frontline mechanic since it makes the world feel more like there is an actual war going on, but they should not have removed the need to destroy enemy bases to liberate regions, which was the main content of all previous Just Cause games.-In this vast, beautiful map, there is really nothing to do except the story missions, of which there are not very many, are short and so far have been quite forgettable (I haven't finished them all yet so I hope it gets better near the end). The archaeology missions are fun though (even if they paint a very unrealistic picture of what archaeology is like), but maybe I am just saying that because I am an archaeologist and just love what I do. There is also challenges to complete in every region, but they are just boring "fly or drive through these hoops" affairs and they are not actually challenging at all.To sum it up, Just Cause 4 is a fun sandbox to mess around in. It has a beautiful, well-designed map but the game doesn't really make use of it. Everything you destroy just respawns after a little while, so all the sandbox action unfortunately quickly starts to feel pointless. And once you grow tired of pointlessly destroying the same stuff over and over again the only thing to do is bland story missions and dumb repetitive challenges. It really had the potential to be a great game, but it got screwed over by one massive, really bad change in the core game design. Respawning, pointless bases really aren't fun, and destroying these massive complexes in inventive ways used to be the primary fun thing to do in Just Cause games.  By making them just respawn, the developers took out all of the satisfaction you got from destroying them. And without all that fun, Just Cause 4 is really just the empty shell of a Just Cause game.Please play Just Cause 3 or 2 instead, they are much, much better games that will keep you entertained for far longer, even despite the horrible optimisation and performance of Just Cause 3. At least that is one more plus point for Just Cause 4, it does run great with almost no lag, stuttering or crashes which JC3 suffered from a lot. Unfortunately that does not compensate for its lack of fun gameplay.;Not Recommended;17.2;15/04/2019;456;10
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;It's.. sorta worth it if you get it very on sale. But just get Just Cause 3. It's a better game. This game feels like the devs forgot what made Just Cause 3 so much fun. I think the best example of this is how region takeovers are performed. This is the core gameplay loop. to progress the story you need to liberate the area that missions take place in, often multiple areas per story mission. This should be one of the most fun parts of the game. It is in JC3, but not in JC4.In Just Cause 3, you take over areas by liberating military outposts. You 'liberate' them by... blowing everything up. If it's a static object with red bits, it's explosive and you need to remove it. There are some awesome really big setpiece things to destroy, like massive radar dishes. This fits in with the core gameplay perfectly. you can seamlessly transition between tearing things apart with your grappling hook, to hijacking a helicopter to fire missiles at them, to crashing the helicopter into one last tower before switching to a mounted gun, or your RPG, or anything. In Just Cause 4, you take over regions by.. performing really boring missions inside the bases. The enemy spawn rate seems to have gone down compared to JC3. you'll sometimes find yourself totally alone in these enemy bases. Without a focus on destroying things, almost your entire toolkit as a player is worthless. No need for vehicles. their destructive capabilities are wasted, and getting around is actually faster without them. No big set pieces to find fun ways to tear apart, because that's not the objective anymore, it's hack this console, escort these refugees, pull those breakers, stand still in this small area to complete an upload.;Not Recommended;11.2;6/06/2021;372;1
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;Before you buy this game, you should really listen to the negative reviews. I ignored them, thinking it would be another JC game that I would enjoy, and that the negative reviews were just the result of some day 1 bugs or people's expectations being too high.Oh, was I wrong. This is actually a bad game. There are an extreme amount of reasons for this. Graphical glitches, absolutely unacceptable graphics/textures/etc. considering how JC3 looked, bad- no, TERRIBLE story. Many features from JC3 have been removed, like the sticky explosives, pistols, and liberation mechanics, which is literally the whole focal point of the game. All of my actions feel entirely disconnected from the outcome of my actions. I go and download some files, and bam I've liberated an entire region. Where in JC3 it felt good liberating areas and took some work, in JC4 it's literally you pressing a button. The missions are so, so much worse. They're all bland "go here, wait for bar to go up/down, you win!" missions, which brings me to my biggest gripe with the game:IT IS BORING. It is so unbelievably boring that you could easily fall asleep playing it. You know how destroying things is important in Just Cause games? Well, not in this one. Sure, you get chaos points, but you could just get them doing other things. The stuff you destroy eventually respawns, the weapons have low ammo counts, and destroying things isn't nearly as cathartic as it was in JC3.In the end, if you want this game, go buy Just Cause 3. If you already have it, buy the DLC. If you've already 100% the game and all of it's DLC, then replay the game because you're going to get way more enjoyment out of that then mindlessly roaming around a map looking for something to do.;Not Recommended;12.4;27/04/2019;616;13
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;Just Cause 4 forgets its origins.In JC3 the game and it's story seem carefully crafted to NOT take itself too seriously and just enjoy its mechanics of mayhem and destruction.  The witty banter, an over the top dictator, enjoyable destruction via wacky physics, and a whole mess of over powered weaponry entertained me through its main game and all its DLC.JC4 on the other hand takes a turn from some of those elements.  Rico isnt as funny anymore and is border line brooding. He doesn't have any witty companions, the story seems to want to take itself seriously and some of those wacky physics are a bit too wacky.  The departure from its predecessor came as a suprise to me and I believe is a direct result to some of the lesser gripes I was muttering to myself as I played the game.  The choppy water was gone and had been replaced with really crappy looking water. I know, not a big thing, but the waves in JC3 gave life to that part of the game.  It's hard not to notice its absence.Helicopter controls became worse and it was almost impossible for me to target enemy choppers using missiles.  I hardly even know how to describe this issue with text. I literally can not shoot a missile at a flying enemy unless the aiming reticle is on them and turns red, but if that enemy is moving forget about it, because you have to lead your target only you can't because your reticle has to be on the target to get it to turn red so you can shoot at it unless its moving...ARGGGGGHHHH!Some changes, like removing grenades and replacing them with secondary functions on certain weapons have left me on the fence. Most of the secondary functions are great and enjoyable, but I personally like the staple of having grenades at all times. If that was something I wanted to maintain as I played it meant that I had to carry a specific weapon with me that had that secondary function.  And since you can only carry two weapons with you I often times felt limited.  Planted explosives are also gone which is something I miss.  The map just seems so much smaller than JC3.  I bet this statment is false, but I burned through it so damn fast it felt* smaller by comparison.  The introduction of front lines where the rebels are fighting the enemy initially seemed like it would be a cool thing, but there was so little impact to whatever I was doing or how I was progressing through the game it made me wonder why it was there in the first place.  Instead of liberating multiple small settlements to free zones now all one has to do is a single mission. And there are only 3 or 4 versions of that mission and they just aren't as engaging. It seems odd to look back at JC3 and find that the repetitive nature of freeing settlements by blowing up the same damn things was more fun, but there it is.I don't really hate JC4. I can still do goofy things and I have fun with the new tether options that are available.  I gripe because it moved away from things that I liked or expected to see again from JC3.  This game falls into the category of sequels where instead of getting the previous game plus more*, I got a little less with some changes that just didn't measure up to its predecessor.  I haven't given up on this game, but I won't likely spend much time on it unless the DLC's bring something special with them.;Not Recommended;54.3;20/12/2018;1,264;35
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;I'm really torn on writing this review. Just Cause 4 does do some things very well, but other things are a major step backwards from JC3.As a sandbox, JC4 is great. The grapple has been further improved over JC3 with the new balloons and upgrades to the existing boosters and tether. There's a nice variety of terrain to explore and random stuff to blow up, and a lot more working utility vehicles with functional cranes and forklifts for example. Plus there's new weather control bases you can use to spawn destructive weather at will once they've been captured.Unfortunately, as a game, JC4 just isn't that much fun at times. JC3 got a lot of flak for the base liberation being repetitive and tedious at times and JC4 tried to address that with more missions. On the surface this seems like a good idea until you realize that the same few annoying mission objectives are copy-pasted multiple times with just slight variations. To make things worse, many of these objectives involve defending fragile items or hacking terminals with a countdown timer where you can't do anything else, and have to restart when interrupted. The endless respawning hyper-aggresive AI in Just Cause has always been a problem, and mission objectives like these just highlight how bad it is when attack helicopter after attack drone appears out of nowhere and does massive damage to the fragile item you have to protect. Worse, the controls are frequently unresponsive and the gunplay is sloppy, and the endless respawning enemies include way too many soldiers with grenade/rocket launchers that will ragdoll you all over the place. Not to mention that the DEVS REMOVED C4!!!This is why I'm torn on this review. The sandbox is great, but it's locked behind a lot of content that's more frustrating than fun, and the linear missions remove the freedom you had in earlier games on how to approach liberating bases.At the end of the day I've decided to recommend this game with major caveats. Get it on sale, do not pay full price for this. Use a savegame or mod that opens up the sandbox much earlier and save yourself the frustration of dealing with the poor mission design.The Good:World is more varied and interesting than JC3PROPER TRACKED TANKS!!!Working actuators on vehicles like cranes and forkliftsImproved grapple abilitiesInteresting weapons with alternate fire modesCutscenes and story are surprisingly decent with lots of humorFriendly tanks/choppers will occasionally help you out in combatThe Bad:Can't take over bases by blowing stuff up, have to complete annoyingly linear missions including dreaded escort/protect/hacking objectivesAI is still as annoying and bad as ever with enemies appearing out of thin air right next to youSloppy on-foot/grapple controls and gunplayBikes are terrible to driveLess destroyable bridges compared to JC3The Ugly:NO C4!!!Update:I got the gold edition with the DLC and finished playing through the DLC content, so here's a quick review of the DLC:Weaponized Wingsuit:Awesome, one of the best reasons to get the gold edition. Makes some missions much easier since you have infinite wingsuit missiles. More or less the same thing you get from JC3's sky fortress DLC.Dare Devils of Destruction:Mad Max style death races in JC4. The new vehicle variants with guns are fun, but the actual missions themselves are annoying score attack objectives that you'll need to replay repeatedly to unlock everything. 5/10, worth playing if you have gold, hard to recommend getting if you don't.Los Demonios:Bad, bad, bad. If you have gold, I wouldn't recommend even starting the mission arc. The rewards aren't even remotely worth it (a crossbow and the ability to spawn the super annoying demon bugs anytime), and if you start the mission arc you'll need to finish the awful missions to get the map back to its original state (demon bug infestations block you from completing some of the vehicle/wingsuit stunts until they're cleared). At least clearing the infestations involves liberation style destroy everything missions instead of protecting/hacking things. The first mission itself is fine at least and moderately interesting, but it goes downhill fast after that. Final boss fight is a new level of awfulness for the franchise worthy of a spot on the list of worst video game boss fights of all time. 1/10, don't waste your time on this content, it will actively make the rest of the game worse until it's fully completed.Danger Rising:Actually a good DLC. Lots of new toys to play with, interesting locations to liberate by destroying everything, and some more story content with Rico and the Agency to boot. Only negatives are some of the mandatory hoverboard challenges to open the reactors are annoying and don't make sense from a gameplay or logical standpoint. 9/10, great DLC pack.;Recommended;70.1;6/11/2019;465;18
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;Was really hoping for this to be good...I loved Just Cause 2 AND 3 and Just Cause 3 was a game that I could waste many, many hours on whenever I was bored.Just Cause 3's addition of a wingsuit felt like something that fit perfectly in the game and the controls were seemingly tight and fluid. The challenge system for unlocking upgrades was annoying at first but at least it forced you to actually use the things in question and, by extension, get better at using them. Soon, after a bit of grinding, I could take down bases with ease, grappling through on my wingsuit as fueltanks blew up behind me. Rico was unstoppable.Then the Sky DLC came out for it (only DLC that was worth it) and everything got better. Suddenly, Rico was a literal super hero, nothing could stop me, barrel-rolling through obstacles as I pumped missles into them from my back, only to dive into the water, jet away under the waves and launch up from underneath like f***ing Iron Man....Now, I bought this with the deluxe content because i wanted that experience of flying a jetpack wingsuit and destablilizing a nation again.What I got was:1) Terrible controls for the wingsuit: Airbraking now stops you dead in the air? No Swooping, no changing directions suddenly, everything feels more sluggish...2) The DLC Jetpack has been bastardized: Your charge for boost gets used up whether you use it fully or not. Accidentally tapped the button? There's all your boost gone. Missiles are innacurate and sometimes just flat bounce off of things. You lose all your speed the millisecond you're done boosting so its usually faster to grapple everywhere. Its so damn hard to manuever when boosting as well, so more often than not you end up smashing your face in. AND WHY OH WHY did the devs get rid of the launching by holding the wingsuit button. It was the coolest thing ever to launch out of an explosion like a damn super hero....3) Graphics: Im not usually one to care too much about graphics as long as it's fun but the water was the one thing that actually took me out of the game because of how bad it looked. I dont want to gripe but JC3 had water that looked a billion times better than this flat, out-of-focus, brown sludge that's everywhere. Not to mention the glitchy texture breaks and the fact that your parachute shows up as a reflection that looms larger than the mountains. And what is up with Tom Sheldons glowing facial hair...4) Gameplay: The story in this game is as cookie cutter as it comes. Escort mission after Escort mission after Escort mission. And for the Piece de Resistance for some unforseen reason, the developers of this game decided to get rid of the most fun aspect of the Just Cause Series: The Chaos. In JC3 and 2 the base liberation revolved around destroying enough enemy infrastructure to to remove their presence from the region. This provided some of the best gameplay experiences that I've had in a while. It gave me a reason to want to unlock and upgrade my weapons and vehicles. Nothing better than clearing a base with a single Bavarium Nuke. In JC4, base liberation is boring, only capturing an entire region when you have enough squads to move a line on your map to encompass that area and then that base is yours, fully intact. The game world is also considerably less destructible, I've only found wooden bridges that i was able to destroy when I had a ton of fun in JC3 sending trains and patrols to their deaths by blowing the bridge at a safe distance....5) Weapons: I've played about 9 hours so far, a lot of which was flying through f***ing rings to get more missiles and more boost for my jet wingsuit, and I've yet to find any weapons that really excited me. Plastic explosives have been completely removed from the game, replaced by booster rockets, which i assume the devs thought everyone liked better, and even then those only explode when modded enough to be useless as boosters.6) Grappling: This grapple system is split into 3 loadouts, which you can switch between freely. However, I would find that I would often need to change my loadout in the menu in the middle of a fight to get the effect I wanted, which completely shatters my fun and immersion. The grapple having all these effects is, for me, way more annoying than fun. I liked the simplicity of JC3 where you had to use the environment to lift things or switch your explosives for boosters to get that effect, and having the grapple just grapple things together and pull.All in all, I think the devs thought they were (or maybe actually were) being pressured to innovate everything to keep things fresh, when in reality they pretty much destroyed everything that I personally enjoyed about the game.Edit: Dec 12, 2018, 5:36pmCouple of extra points about JC4 that I've found after completing the whole game and all side missions:Enemy A.I. seems to be pretty well improved and after going back and playing JC3 right after beating 4, I will say that combat on the ground is better in every way (besides ammo), it feels way more tactile and headshots have a great feel to them, unlike in JC3.The weather, since it was a selling point, should have been implemented more. The three or four types of weather in the game pretty much only exist around the bases it spawns from. I only played one mission other than the main base missions that featured a sandstorm to deal with and I have to say it made the "pick up a sniper and protect mission" I'd done 10 times already way more fun and worth doing. Why wasnt the weather everywhere on the map???       Also yes I understand there were guns that simulated the weather effects (lightning and wind) but why weren't players rewarded with a more powerful version to have fun with, with this being a physics sandbox? I would've rather had a small scale tornado to play with or the chaotic winds of a sandstorm to release on enemies than a windblast and random lightning.Storywise this game takes itself way too seriously. I see a lot of people talking about how JC3 had a s*** story with no humour like what was in JC2 (admittedly JC2 was over-the-top parody funny and I had a ton of fun with my friends playing it), but JC3 had humour of its own with Mario and Rico interacting and DiRivello was, in my opinion, a great villian which you got to see insight into with the collectibles in the game (audio tapes). JC4, in comparison, felt like the devs were trying to hit a way darker tone with the fate of Rico's family and Sheldon's reconciliation. All in all it made for (in my opinion) very shallow experience with characters that you didn't care for at all.The side missions felt tacked on to me. they were more a delivery system for upgrades than actual story bits. The movie producer (forgot her name) was the only one that had actual cutscenes and she's the one I cared about the least. Sargento was the one character I actually cared about, since it seemed Rico felt for him and was taking him under his wing (no pun intended), however he only gets one mission with a cutscene or any plot, the rest he just tells you to do the same thing, with the same recycled lines over the radio (rescue, escort, or snipe). No character growth or interest whatsoever. Javi's missions were cool but were over way too quickly. They all take place on one portion of the map, which is the most boring because there isnt any weather effects or higher level bases nearby.Thus concludes my edited review, let me know what ya'll think or if there is anything I missed.;Not Recommended;18.6;4/12/2018;741;27
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Action, Adventure;R$ 352,91;UpdateI have now finished the game, got every achievement (except the hidden ones, the one about beating a friends feat and the one for getting all achievements). I like this game, once you get through the meh story missions to unlock all the regions and the god-awful liberation missions. It is fun to just fly around in whilst watching YouTube on the other screen. Other than that... Still bad. I do not recommend this, having to do 20+ hours of crap to get to an OK game is really not a good way to spend your time.TL.DRLess explodey version of JC3, if you liked JC3's "explode everything" mentality you probably wont like this.Replaced the "explode all the things to liberate province" missions with "push this button/escort these guys/turret section to liberate province" missions.Pros, Mehs, and ConsPros:More vehicle variety than JC3.The wingsuit is back, and just as awesome as ever.Winner of the "prettiest explosions" award.The alternate fire modes for the weapons is a good addition.Travelling anywhere in this game is fun. I spent most of my time just flying around the map.Meh:No pistols/dual-fire weapons, they were nice but I don't miss them too badly.New way of sorting weapons. Allows for any two weapons to be carried.Battles in the world between the Rebals and the Black Hand/Loyalists are cool to take part in a few times, but mostly don't do anything interesting and get boring very quickly.Balloons on grapples, kinda useless in combat and the novelty of sending people skywards wears off quicker than you would think.Vehicles have amunition counts now, was probably put in to force you to be more flexable in combat. But I never ran out of ammo before my tank exploded or I flew into the ground anyway.The map is waaaay less interesting than JC2 or JC3.Cons:No grenades... Seriously who thought this was a good idea?No C4 explosives. This would go really well with the new grapple mechanic, not sure why they put in the balloons instead.This is the big one. "Liberating" a province now requires you to complete a specific mission in that province. As opposed to blowing up everything as in JC3. These get really boring really quickly.Once you are done, you're done. No replayability.OpinionsLiterally eveything that has changed from JC3 would be fine and I would have no problem shouting from the rooftop that you should buy this game if it wasn't for the stupid decision to go away from the "liberate a province by blowing up all of the red stuff" to the "liberate a province by doing this mission" core gameplay loop.As of writing this I have played about six of these liberation missions and I have exactly zero enthusiasm to play any more. The whole set of game mechanics seem setup for you to have loads of different and interesting ways to go about rapidly deconstructing everything around you in a glorious cacophony of fire and noise. But then the liberation missions (escort missions, push this button over there missions, defend this thing missions) feel constrictive and empty.If these were switched out for JC3 style "explode everything in this area and you win" type liberations, then the game would be excellent.As it is, all of the peripheral side tasks and environment are epic, the liberation missions that make up the core of the gameplay, kinda poo.If you are new to the series, get JC3 instead.;Not Recommended;119.6;25/12/2018;256;12

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Adventure;R$ 106,90;I went into this game really hopeful. Episode one was great, the atmosphere was great, the story hook was great and everything felt really immersive. It felt like you really were in the shoes of Sean, desperately trying to protect himself and his brother in such a messed up situation. The only gripe I had with it was the facial animations were practically nonexistent and the voice acting was a little rough, and it brought me out of the story at times. I thought little of it, however, as it was still the first episode and episodes were to take longer to come out than the first game. When the second episode came out, I was more than a little disappointed by the lack of facial animation, but the voice acting did seem better. The second episode, story-wise still felt like a natural progression to the story, though the time-skip was a little off putting. Everything still worked, the direction the story was going was clear, the stakes were clear and it still felt immersive. I had a couple issues with how they handled a few things, but again, I enjoyed it more than I had issues with it.Then comes episode three. Still no improvement on the facial animations, the voice acting was worse than the first episode, the time skip mixed caused another bump in my ability to remain connected with the story and dear all gods Daniel became the most annoying little scamp I have ever been forced to play alongside. The first bits I could have gladly ignored if they continued with having lovable and relatable characters, but Daniel went from your kind of annoying little brother to a total brat. Sean is then blamed for this transition for doing little other than having other friends completely despite the fact Daniel has his own other friend too. The story takes an odd turn, which could be justified were the execution a little better, but the time skip gets rid of any execution at all, you are simply thrown into it and it is apparently what you have been doing for a while. The time skips feel less like a way to keep the story going and more like a way to ignore doing extra writing, and  the story is suffering greatly for it.The fourth episode (Actual spoilers, from here on) is what managed to make me lose faith in the game. We are greeted to yet another time skip, Sean having been in the hospital for a decent chunk of time and about to go on trial and Daniel is missing. Now, I was forgiving and thought we were in for an interesting start with the hospital escape, then a scene happens that seriously rubs me the wrong way. Sean takes a break from driving to sleep and it turns out he is on the private property of racists. I do not know if this can be avoided, but for me at least it ended with Sean getting the living heavens beat out of him. And then nothing happens. The scene does not matter later in the story, it is just there to give Sean some more pain on top of all the pain he is already in. I do not know if they added it in either because they wanted their main character to suffer more or if they thought this was clever writing relating to topical events happening right now, but the scene could have been removed from the game and literally the game would be the exact same. That is not good writing.Then we come to the part where we finally see Daniel again and he is in some sort of cult and praised as a sign from god. All immersion with the story I held onto was thrown out the window. This is so far away from the original presented story that I do not even know where the writers are taking this anymore and trust me when I say that is not a good thing. Sean is then promptly blamed for being a bad brother, despite all of the constant sacrafices he makes to keep Daniel happy and healthy. I will bring that up later, because if you have played the game, you know exactly where this goes from bad to full on unhealthy and problematic. Sean then gets to meet his mother, who I guess shows her face again to save Daniel despite abandoning both her children and her husband. You can tell they try to make you like this character, but as someone who has had both parents abandon them, it didn't work. Maybe for some people it did but her only excuse is being forced into the role of a mother by society, so she couldn't live out her dreams. That pissed me off so much, I did not have words. Maybe it would have been fine if she still remained a part of their lives, or if she even at least wrote them letters or at least let them know she still cared but no. She was gone without a trace and we are supposed to be okay with that because society made her. That is beyond upsetting and treats Sean and Daniel less like children and more like burdens to her. Finally, everyone bands together to free Daniel. I really could not care less about anyone except for Sean, who is the only character in this game I still like. Which is just wonderful as we are treated to him getting beat up over and over to prove that he really does care about Daniel. What in the ever living hell did Sean do to deserve that? He has shown nothing but concern over his brother who has constantly disregarded him and acted like a brat. Heavens forbid he spend a bit of time with friends while still taking care of his brother. I really, really do not know what the writers are going with here, that scene was disturbing for reasons I do not think they were intending. The only way I can think this as being anything but poor writing would be if they go with the clever route of actually showcasing this behavior as dangerous and Daniel as an antagonist who refuses to learn. I really think that might be the only saving grace for the story, paired with proper facial animations and voice acting because oh my, did they drop the ball on this episode, so hard the ball shattered and we are left with a bunch of expressionless characters and unfitting voices acting out what can only be described as a soap opera that has gone on so long they needed to go completely off the wall for shock value.;Not Recommended;3.6;1/10/2019;232;9
Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Adventure;R$ 106,90;Loved the first life is strange game. The characters were corny and awkward, just like in any story based around teen drama. However, I always felt engaged in the mystery and pushing the plot forward. The game play was also very satisfying. The power to explore different choices and rewind the clock made it a good match for a narrative style player choice driven game. Life is strange 2 lacks the same charm. It still has the corny writing, but I didn't warm to the characters or the story. It had no grand mystery and game play was less engaging. Firstly because you don't play as the brother with the powers and the powers themselves aren't as interesting or as satisfying as time manipulation. I get what they were trying to do, but it just kept falling flat. I kept playing out of obligation, rather than intrigue. I wanted to like this game, but I just left feeling underwhelmed.So overall, not terrible. Just a hard act to follow.;Not Recommended;14.5;1/06/2020;257;3

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Adventure;R$ 106,90;I played ‚Life is Strange 2‘ a year ago and I still can’t get it out of my head. I’ve never had such an intense experience with a game. Ever!I’m an over 50 years old guy and I couldn’t stop crying when I finished the last episode. The emotions hurled me out of my regular life for a complete week and even now, after so many months, I still can’t listen to the soundtrack or some of the trailers without heavy sobbing.I like emotional and story driven games and I’ve played many, but non of them had such an impact on me, not even LiS1.I tried to play the game as realistically as possible, which means I never went back once I made a decision. I regretted some of them, but that made it even better, because that’s how it is in real life and it makes it easier to identify with the main character Sean.There were a few moments where I missed alternative ways to deal with a situation, where I thought that a character acted illogical or where I felt that something was forced on me, but those were just a handful of negligible moments and forgivable.The game really shines when it comes to pacing, which had always been DONTNOD’s strong suit. I was constantly strung up and afraid of making mistakes that’ll hurt Daniel and/or Sean (remember: no reload for me). But quite often, LiS2 lets the player breath, enjoy the moments of calm and silence. I treasure those moments and I’m glad the devs know where to put them in order to enrich the story.---When the weather is right and I’m in the mood, I snatch my sketchbook, listen to the soundtrack from LiS2 (cry a little) and go for a walk. Sometimes I find something interesting enough to draw or scribble, sometimes not. It doesn’t matter, because every time I remember how I traveled together with Sean and Daniel. It was a year ago and it was “just a game”, but it was also a one-of-a-kind experience and the memories still accompany me.No other game has ever managed this.;Recommended;24.2;20/08/2021;80;N/I

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Adventure;R$ 106,90;Episode 1 is great.If you're reading all the reviews mentioning politics, just keep in mind that some people are going focus on that more than you might. I played through all of episode 1 expecting a really preachy scene or constant victimization like I had read about in other reviews and it never really happened. I think some people are just primed to take everything as a personal attack.Beyond all that, the story in EP1 sets up an interesting dynamic between surviving and looking after your little sibling. Where in Life is Strange 1 a choice may cause a character to trust you now and work with you later, in LiS 2, a choice might mean the difference between eating or having to steal to live, with each outcome impacting your little brother in positive or negative ways, as he both depends on you, and looks to you to set an example.The choices in EP1 are not earth-shattering, but if you've played LiS 1, you know that your choices make bigger ripples in EP2 or even EP4, so hopefully we see the same growth.Overall, the same level of storytelling is there, but the next few episodes will really dictate whether the story blooms like the first Life is Strange or not.;Recommended;3.2;2/10/2018;206;2

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Adventure;R$ 106,90;So I played through chapters one and two, and to be honest, I doubt I'll end up playing further than that. First off, some disclaimers to be fair to the creators: the gameplay is very smooth and the environments are rich. I would never say that this is a bad game because I don't think it is. I just think that it falls down on what it tries to make the heart of the game experience, which is the two main brothers, and I think that a lot of the mistakes made in the original LiS are carried over here. First off, the brothers: they have their charming moments. Their relationship does feel real, as does Sean's anxiety about taking care of his brother. In the first episode, I enjoyed Daniel as a child character who felt like a child but who could still be helpful in his own right. I think that the second episode really fell down on this, though. Many of the conflicts that crop up in the second episode happen because of Daniel's childish insistence on making dumb decisions, and the narrative forces you to go along with them even if you try to say no. Not only does this leave me as a player feeling like my choices don't matter, but it leads to me resenting Daniel because the narrative has used him as a device to force me into doing things I don't want to for no good reason. (If he were sick and I had to do something dangerous to take care of him, that'd be one thing, but doing dumb things because he's bored puts my teeth on edge.) The beginning of Chapter 3 did nothing to make me feel like this issue would be resolved, since it started off with the player rewarding Daniel for stealing from him. So due to the way the narrative uses Daniel as an obstacle rather than a motivation for player decisions, I find what could have been a charming character insufferable. I would be more patient if he were a real flesh and blood child, but he's a character made of code intended to contribute to an entertaining experience, and in the second chapter, he doesn't for me. Because of this, the investment I had in Sean's growth as a brother figure and the development of their relationship soured. This is on top of the fact that sometimes the game forces you into making decisions you don't want to and can think of a perfectly logical way around, but I think it's unfair to ding games for that too hard. I've only ever seen a couple multi-choice games really allow for completely divergent story lines, and they had armies of programmers for a reason. I get that sometimes you need to railroad the story a bit.There's also the fact that it doesn't feel like this game has any unique gameplay elements the way that the original LiS did. Sean can't manipulate time, and he can't really do anything else either. Daniel is the one with powers, and from a gameplay standpoint, it's a little boring to have someone else be the one with powers and I occasionally order them around (and sometimes they won't even listen to me). I appreciate the risk this was from a story standpoint, but it doesn't really add to the gameplay and the whole thing ends up a bit tacked on, peripheral to the main conflict. Maybe Sean will develop powers later on, but I feel like I gave the game a fair shake by giving it two chapters, and the second chapter really didn't do much to inspire me to keep going. Like I said: I don't think the game is bad. I think that there are a lot of people who would absolutely love it and think Daniel is charming and have no problem with the bland gameplay. But for me personally, this was enough for me to go on to other games.;Not Recommended;10.2;5/06/2019;277;10
Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Adventure;R$ 106,90;I had a lot of doubts when purchasing this game after reading negative reviews. But after playing all four available at the moment episodes I could say that they're misleading. Most points were like (please forgive me for possible grammar, spelling or lexical mistakes as english is not my native language):1. "Second game is nothing like first" - that's quite true, but why it should be? The most missing mechanic (as I could understand) is the time rewind. But this series named "Life is strange" and the story follows this line. New mechanics can appeal to someone or not, but you shouldn't just await the game to repeat the same thing over and over. 2. "Too much politics" - well, that's a confusing term. So far I hadn't find any government relation to the story at all. Most of it is just people outlook, ideology, perception, stupidity or misconceptions. It's not a bad thing essentially, it's just life.3. "Too much agressive racism" - I had several moments where I could think that situations depiced are exeggerated. But after some thought, they're not unambiguous. Sometimes agressors were in the right in their own actions, and we all should understand that out there are a lot of different people with different views. And again, it's not the point of the story and game itself, it's just a several encounters that could be logically explained.4. "Not enough choices and interactions" - it could be true. I hadn't replayed it yet (waiting for the last episode before that) and couldn't assess if choices matter. But as for now, I feel that progression follows my own course. Probably I just selected canonic version that was designed at most. Anyway, even if the story is on rails, I, personally, enjoying how it's presented, even if it's just the false appereance of the free will.5. "No character progression" - can't argue with this one, mainly because besides two main characters anybody else just ride along in a single episode with short overlaps or flashbacks. It's a bit disappointing, I'd personally wanted to see a bit more involvement of secondary characters in the game. But, is it necessarily bad? The theme is a road trip, escape from "the bad" and trying to find a place to belong. If you spend some time to actually listen and interact with the world and people around you (not just rush the storyline) then you could know them a bit more, their stories and a background, and tend to like or dislike them, feel connected.6. "Telltale clone, cinematic game, no puzzles, etc" - yeah, that's it. If you don't like following the story, listening to the surroundings, be interested without "quest taken" or specific task assigned, explore and inquire, then it's game just not for you. Which is not making a game bad.UPD 21.09.19: 7. Some spoilers ahead for the gamer who hadn't play the game, be warned: "The Daniel is being complete jerk". Have you ever tried to put yourself in his shoes? To lost everything in your "normal life" and gain a supernatural power? It should change your character. And do not forget, he is pre-teen, he is growing and trying to cut off parental influence and make his own decisions. It's really a bad combo, and that's exactly what is shown there. It's driving me mad, but it's true. My own child without any powers could do the same in the future, and it's perfectly normal :)So, what am I trying to say? I'm glad that I bought this game despite negative reviews. It's a solid product, and I have no complains on it. It's not for everyone, but you could just try it out and find for youself. Peace!;Recommended;79.5;25/08/2019;158;7
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;All in all, this is a good game and worth playing. I was a bit skeptic, due to the mixed reviews (especially some people were still negative even by getting it in sale at 15€). I must say, at 15€ it's absolutely a bargain even with its flaws.Mankind Divided continues the story of human revolution, so i don't understand how some negative reviews bash this aspect of the game. It's a sequel, what did you expect?Some people hate the fact that there isn't a real tie-in to the choices taken in human revolution, in fact, you don't need a savegame. Did you save somebody? Did you pick a certain ending? It doesn't matter, the game will recap the first chapter and skip all these customization through careful dialogs and skilled story telling. It's a bit annoying, i can agree, but really, not that big deal like somebody tells.This game has a huge problem for many people: it's not human revolution. HR set the bar very high (especially considering the franchise. Do you remember the time when deus ex 1 was the only good deus ex?) and beating that was going to be a challenge: some people will never be happy.The game has a few flaws, and, in my opinion, are all cause of possible budget cuts or crunch time. Often you see a lack of variety (for example the underground loading screens) which should not be present in AAA games as this one. Do they break immersion? A little. Are they game breaking? Absolutely not. It is true, in order to shove a lot of content in the game (with side missions) many things are sospiciously convenient. Need to do side mission X? What a coincidence, it's just 20 meters over there, just the apartment in front side mission Y.Yet, the story is not bad (although take a few hours to get you engaged) and although i didn't like --- MINOR SPOILER AHEAD ---- the fact that it leaves the door open for a new chapter -------- END OF MINOR SPOIELR ----  i overall had fun.The final mission especially is my favourite part of the game even if it's probably a little too short.Some other minor annoying stuff are there, but really, it's still a very good game. If you liked Human Revolution, this game is for you too.;Recommended;22.1;29/05/2017;3,165;106
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is an absolutely beautiful, intricately detailed, amazingly realised piece of exposition. It improves upon Human Revolution in nearly every way, and I laud Edios for the amount of work and effort that went into this game, however it is clear that Square Enix cut this title into pieces to sell as DLC and future Deus Ex games and as a testing bed for the atrocious microtransactions. I had heard that Mankind Divided's main story ended quite abruptly, but when the New Game+ notification appeared and the credits began rolling I was in disbelief. I bought this game on the expectation that I was going to experience a complete story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Mankind Divided is only the beginning. It is frustrating, because everything about Mankind Divided is amazing. The fusion of classical European and post modern architecture is beautiful and this world is a distinct cyberpunk that stands alone from the masses of Blade Runner inspired worlds. The combat and stealth are a massive improvement over Human Revolution, and the level design is top notch all across the board. The story (main and side quests) and its themes, despite being a bit heavy handed and not thoroughly fleshed out, have so much potential in addition to the characters that inhabit them. Everything about this game screams potential, it is such a shame that Square Enix had to mess it up.;Not Recommended;126.5;27/11/2016;2,12;35
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;Deus Ex died so we could get Avengers insteadVery sad, I cry everytiem;Recommended;89.9;26/11/2020;352;38
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;You're probably wondering why I'm "Not recommending" a game that I've invested literally 5 days of my life into. For one, because Steam doesn't have a "meh" option. but mainly, because compared to its predecessor Human Revolution, this game isn't really that good.Let's rewind to 2011, when HR was released. As a reboot of a much-loved series, it pretty much did everything right: great characters that you actually cared about, overarching plot that built to a very satisfying crescendo, and of course game mechanics that could suit anyone from the stealthiest hacker to the most gung-ho gunslinger. Yes, there were some rough edges, but they were easily forgivable given the scope and breadth of Eidos Montreal's accomplishment.Given all that, the most burning question on my mind is: how the hell did it then take them half a decade to release what is essentially an expansion to HR? And I use the word expansion deliberately, because overall Mankind Divided feels like less of a game than its older sibling.This is due to a lot of things. Firstly, and most importantly, instead of there being multiple cities between missions, there's one hub - Prague - that you return to repeatedly. Now, Prague definitely changes and evolves between each mission, but it doesn't really grow. you can visit almost the entirety of it right from the beginning of the game, which means that coming back to it time and time again becomes pretty boring.That isn't helped by the fact that Prague is just plain small. there are maybe a dozen streets with about the same number of side alleys. In terms of footprint it's probably larger than HR's Detroit and Hengsha combined, but those cities were redeemed by the fact that they had more going on on roofs and multi-storey apartment blocks than they did at street level. Prague has sewers, street level, a few empty apartments higher up and... that's it.The ridiculous load times, which were marginally acceptable in HR in 2011 but are actually offensive in MD in 2016, make this seem even worse because getting around becomes a chore. If Bethesda can ship Skyrim and Fallout 4 with multi-kilometre-square maps that have no loading times (apart from fast travel), then I fail to see why MD can't have a single seamless map for the maybe 1 square kilometre that makes up Prague. You literally have to endure a loading screen to get from one small half of Prague to the other... what? Why?Hey, did you like the characters in HR? Too bad, because you ain't gonna see them in this game! Sarif makes three video cameos, assuming you do the side mission involving him. Pritchard? Referenced a couple of times. Malik? Referenced once, extremely indirectly. Taggart? Referenced once (yeah, he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but still a well-portrayed one).What we have in their place are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes that exist for no other reason than to push the plot along. You have the hacker lady who literally does nothing, the gruff leader who doesn't like it when you go off script, his second-in-command who doesn't like you, and the pilot who also doesn't like you. None of them are particularly likeable or memorable, most just get on your nerves, and talking to them really doesn't affect or alter the outcome of the game in any way. Terrible lipsyncing doesn't help to endear them either.And then there's the villains - or should I say, villain. HR didn't do too well on this front, but at least it had more than one Big Bad and by extension, more than a single boss fight. MD has quite literally one boss fight, right at the end of the game, and you know exactly who it's going to be against BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY ONLY ONE CHARACTER IT CAN BE - a character you meet halfway through the game. Who is so laughably obviously the Big Bad, that all the contortions the game pulls to try to make you second-guess and think it's someone else are just cringeworthy."Cringeworthy" is a pretty good description of the plot, actually. This being a Deus Ex game, one would expect a meandering plot with a few dead ends, and while HR delivered, MD plays it pretty much straight. I don't have an issue with straight plots, even in a Deus Ex game - as long as they're played honest. MD doesn't do that. instead of owning its join-the-dots plot and trying to play to its strengths, it tries to obfuscate and hide that simplicity under layers and layers of unnecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and poorly-executed misdirection, and the end result is that it just ends up feeling needlessly annoying and forced.As for gameplay, it's HR with the rough edges mostly polished. Takedowns are easier to execute and stealthier in that Jensen actually (gasp!) attempts to hide his victims as part of the takedown animation. However, dragging unconscious enemies, or corpses, to hiding spots is just as irritating as HR, in that sometimes the dragging just stops for no apparent reason, or a limb gets stuck on something and you have to go around and pull from a different angle. And no, you still can't just PICK UP AND CARRY bodies, which would obviate this whole mess.Combat: just like everything else in MD, the selection of weapons is similar to HR, but lesser. On the plus side you now have the option to upgrade weapons with crafting parts that can be found and bought. on the downside, some of the most powerful weapons are no longer available. Presumably this is to encourage players to rely more on the new augmentations, but Deus Ex as a series has always been about choice, and MD takes away rather than giveth. Also, no Boxguards. :'(The new augs are pretty cool, although you can't really play with them until later in the game due to another arbitrary plot speedbump. The Remote Hacking aug in particular is probably my favourite (in fact I'd say it's almost essential), but again, it feels like something that could've and should've been in HR. There are a lot more lethal augs to complement the Typhoon, which itself is now available in a non-lethal option, and they make it possible to finish the game without using any handheld weapons, which is nice I guess.Oh, and then there's Breach mode, which is now free sooo... doesn't really contribute to my overall sentiment towards MD. It does add some unique new mechanics and looks pretty cool in a Tron-like way, but again... free. Also microtransactions.Finally, this game has some serious bugs - be careful with the inventory screen because often, attempting to customise a weapon from it causes the game to crash to desktop. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why this happens, and often attempting to customise the same weapon that caused the crash before, causes another crash - the only fix is to drop that weapon from your inventory and pick it up again. Then there's the black screen issue, whereby a single pixel goes black, then the pixels around it, then all the pixels around them... etc. until the entire screen is black and the game crashes the display driver. The "fix" is to switch your Smart Vision augment on and then off again - but good luck doing that if you're stuck in dialog or a hacking minigame. Maybe it's only a problem with NVIDIA hardware, but it's piss poor whatever way you look at it. (Yes, I have the latest patch. No, it's not overclocking or corrupted drivers.)To conclude: on its own, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is a good game, especially if you enjoy stealth. Unfortunately its predecessor Human Revolution is a great game, which makes it difficult to recommend this one unless you're a HR veteran looking for more of the same. If you're looking to start with the Deus Ex series, HR is better and cheaper. play that first before deciding whether you want to buy this.And seriously, Square Enix? You want me to purchase mission DLC that probably should've been part of the full game? As if the microtransactions and single-use items weren't enough? Stop trying to milk this franchise and get out of Eidos' way.;Not Recommended;120.5;13/04/2017;566;13
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;MASSIVE LET DOWN Ok, so I pre-ordered DXMD and completed it on "Give Me Deus Ex" level along with all side missions within just 2 days of release. After I completed it I uninstalled it and didn't bother writing a review as they were already negative and explaned the issues fully. I really wanted to enjoy this game, as I have had great fun in Human Revoulution and for most of my playthrough I was having fun. However this game ended up being a great let down to me and I'll tell you why... Pros: + Beautiful Visuals & effects+ Smooth/fluid gameplay & controls+ Great ambient theme & soundtrack+ Immersive environment+ Good sound design (apart from gun sounds)From the above you are probably wondering why this is getting a bad review, but the thing is this game lacks severly in major areas. I want to get this one off my chest quickly. Deus Ex games have always had multiple "hubs", where you can roam around environments freely, exploring, recieving quests and buying items. However DXMD only has 1 hub, which ruins the global travel theme shown in the games before it.... and ooohhhh boy the worst part about this game is the embarrasing lack of content. I don't blame the developers at all, it seems like Square Enix had just cut large amounts out of the game to pump out later as dlc. This games story was great for the first 5 hours of gameplay, however it turned to litteral ♥♥♥♥ afterwards. I have seen Call Of Duty pull off better stories than this, honestly it is less than half the length of the story in DXHR and it certainly wasn't quality over quantity. One thing they advertised and hyped up, was the supposedly "important" decision making, but it ended up being almost non-existent. Instead of your choices being reflected in gameplay, it only changes what is shown on Picus News near the end of the game. THE ENDING IS LITERALLY YOUR CHOICES IN THE STORY BEING READ BACK TO YOU BY PICUS NEWS , no joke it has to be the worst ending they could have possibly come up with lmao. I cannot recommend this game at full price, maybe if it's under £10 you should buy, infact I would wait for a directors cut version where they give you the content they took in the first place. A massive let down to DX fans, everyone would prefer Human Revolution, buy that instead if you get the chance.I'm also worried people will be fooled into buying this game as they keep dropping prices for the main game & DLCs. Please don't give into the fact that it's a Deus Ex game and it has to be good... I did so and I regret it. Soon enough it and the season pass, as well as probably a Directors Cut edition will be released at a much lower price. These price drops, and the introduction of Breach being free-to-play show that Square-Enix is bent on trying to squeeze as much money out of this game as they possibly can.;Not Recommended;44.5;29/01/2017;1,103;27

Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Action, RPG;R$ 124,99;It's an almost surreal experience to be writing a negative review for a Deus Ex game, after having invested countless hours in the series and enjoying them immensely (The Fall notwithstanding), but here we are. I will try to keep this short and sweet.The game is awesome, the trademark Deus Ex feeling of having many possible pathways to solving a problem is there, the character customization is there, the great worldbuilding and lore is there (including references and callbacks to the series as whole), the excellent characters are there, and the gameplay itself is very similar to the one of Human Revolution (Which was top notch), and even improved in some areas. In short, the game is a treat and if you liked Human Revolution, you will certainly love Mankind Divided.Now you will be thinking "But what is the problem? How come the game is reviewed negatively if it has so much going for it?"The fatal flaw lies in the story. Not even the quality of the story itself, but that the game is clearly cut in half, in what has to be one of the worst cases of executive meddling I have ever seen, because I refuse to believe this is how it was intended from the beginning. The ending is a coitus interruptus in game form.To put it more graphical terms (Spoilers for DX: HR coming), imagine you are playing Human Revolution, and after killing Barret, you are shown a cinematic of Adam talking to Sarif about him going to Hengsha to continue his investigation, and then the credits start to roll (30 minutes of unskippable credits, mind you, just to rub more salt in the wound).And to add further insult to injury, two of the secondary missions in Detroit are sold as a separate DLC (Which clearly seems they were ripped from the main content), plus an extra hyper bland game mode topped off with microtransactions and lootboxes. Completely disgusting.Deus Ex is a franchise that has a very dear place in my heart and while I certainly enjoyed the story and would like to know how it continues, I cannot abide these despicable commercial practices.

Bethesda Softworks;Fallout 4;RPG;R$ 59,99;Greetings: My grandson talked me into trying Fallout 4. I'm an older player (65) who enjoys video games. I am very impressed with the game overall though I do wish I didn't have the CTD's and other issues with the game. But the ability to do the kind of building along with the post war setting has been a lot of fun. Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try. I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things. I do use quite a few mods and I'm sure the contributes to the CTD's etc in the game. I thing Bethsadia has done a great job presenting this game. I played the original Fallout many years ago. Having learned how to make video's of the gameplay and posting on youtube (mostly for my grandson to see my settlements) has been a nice side benefit of playing fallout.

Bethesda Softworks;Fallout 4;RPG;R$ 59,99;Yeah, I've played it for a little bit.In all seriousness: this game has divided fan opinions, but in short: if you don't mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to do, then I'd recommend this game for you. I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:The good:+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like  laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace "regular" enemies depending on the player level.+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.The bad:- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.The mixed:* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games. Luckily, the bad retconning is limited to minor details only.* Creation Club. Like most of the world, I'm against paid mods, but fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything. In fact, they seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or two, so you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoever.In the end, I don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyone...so let me put it this way:If you prefer more in-depth roleplay, then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3.If you don't mind that and the flaws listed above too much, then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10. For what's it worth, I've certainly enjoyed it.;Recommended;4,694.5;10/10/2018;459;31
Bethesda Softworks;Fallout 4;RPG;R$ 59,99;How to make Fallout 4 a decent ROLE-PLAYING gameYou might already know that Fallout 4 is a step backward from predecsessors when it comes to role-playing. So first download and install these mods: (Also note this is just my personal recommendation of mods)- Outcast and Remnants- Project Valkyrie- Fusion City (optional)- Depravity Evil Role Playing mod- Diary of a Madman- Start me Up (Alternate start mod)And that's it you're good to go. You can be whatever you want with these mods, you want to make peace with all factions? sure go ahead. You want to kill every factions and leaving with only you and your raider gangs to colonized the Commonwealth? sure go ahead.Another recommedation of mods that i personally use:- Real World Damages.     This mod will remove the bullet sponge throughout the game and can be really useful to   conserve ammo and your luggage. And also this mod will make you kill enemies easier, but  of course the NPC can also kill you by instantly, so neat right?- Full Dialog Interface.     Bring back dialog box options like in New Vegas.- Binary Speech Checks.     Makes the speech checks binary like in New Vegas.- Survival Options.     Bring back the quicksave or autosave options when playing the game on survival diificulty   mode. Because you don't know when the game would randomly crash right? this will   become a lifesaver.I already have 7th playthrough with this game and i will keep playing it from time to time.Now enjoy with your new fresh playhtrough Fallout 4.;Recommended;844.4;12/11/2021;413;8

Certainly not intuitive for a guy that's never played anything like this, but I relished the challenge. I had no idea what I was doing at first: I died many times, and progressed slowly. Used Google for UESP for game info, and that helped tremendously. I made it to Level 83, sort of ran out of things to do, so created a new character, and am playing it differently.

Bethesda Softworks;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;RPG;R$ 149,00;Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment. worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream "Fus Ro Dah!", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. "Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing."I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!;Recommended;1,757.6;28/04/2022;604;327

Bethesda Softworks;Doom Eternal;Action;R$ 79,00;Okay, as a 50+ year old gamer who's been playing since the 1970's I know my limits and I tend to stay away from "twitch" games where reaction times have to be razor sharp. With that in mind I avoided this game for a while, in spite of having enjoyed and finished every previous DOOM iteration from the beginning. When it went on a great sale I figured "what the heck" and decided to give it a try, thinking it might be a short-lived experiment. Boy was I wrong. The controls are intuitive and easy to master. The encounters are a blast and even failing is pretty fun as you figure out where you went wrong. I'm playing on the second level of difficulty and finding it challenging but just challenging enough to make it a lot more fun. The music and graphics are also excellent and add to the excitement.I do find that the best technique for surviving a difficult battle is to to just pace myself, taking bites out of the boss and avoiding going toe-to-toe with them as I run and jump around. I keep flaming and death punching the baddies to keep my armor and health up and I choose a weak one every now and then to chainsaw and get the ammo up. I can't really recommend this game enough. It's well balanced and exciting but not too overwhelming and it really rewards the creative use of weapons and using actual strategies. If you're old like me, don't be afraid and give it a go. You'll be glad you did.;Recommended;38.7;15/08/2021;1,465;23

Bethesda Softworks;Doom Eternal;Action;R$ 79,00;It's the raw cerebral intensity of Quake married with Doom's enemy roster and its violent, cathartic attitude. Enjoying this game requires a certain frame of mind, a certain willingness to push yourself and to think in the heat of the moment. But it's extremely rewarding if you meet it on its own terms. Nearly every weapon feels like it has a significant role, a stark contrast to Doom 2016's promotion of 2 weapon playstyles. Ammo counts have been massively reduced, pushing the player towards intelligent use of their loadout. Overall, the way I would describe this difference is that Doom 2016 treats its weapons as a set of toys, in which any can be used at any time without too much consequence. Doom Eternal treats them as tools, and you have to use them well to achieve success.The Doom Slayer is more mobile in every possible way and the combat is even more fast paced. Enemies are smarter, more aggressive and more varied across the board. New abilities like the blood punch, flame belch and ice grenade have been added, and provide even more tactical depth.The end result of all of this is a hyper-intense gameplay loop of constant movement, weapon swapping, and decision making. It makes you feel like a demon-slaying god when you finally overcome. It's extremely engaging to the point that I keep coming back even after like 4 playthroughs.All in all, from a gameplay standpoint it's one of the best SP FPS games ever, and a clear improvement over Doom 2016 in all of the ways that matter most. There's really not much else like this in the modern market. In an age in which arena shooters and movement based shooters are dying and the market is overwhelmingly shifting towards slower, less intense genres like tactical shooters and Battle Royales, it's nice to know that a game like this can still be made and find success. I'll get sappy for a second and say this: Thank you, id Software. You're the only AAA developer that still cares about the things I value in a shooter.;Recommended;139.5;17/11/2020;645;12

Bethesda Softworks;Prey;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;Prey is something else.People tend to compare it to the older Bioshock (1&2) games, and they're not entirely wrong, but that's just what it looks like on the surface.Wrench? CheckMultiple superpowers that are found over the course of the game? CheckWeapons that can be upgraded to deepen your playstyle? CheckA game world that was once sprawling with life and is now mostly deserted? CheckGeneral horror aesthetic and fear of the unknown in a claustrophobic space? CheckIf you look at it like that, it might as well could be a spiritual successor of Bioshock, however, Arkane stepped above and beyond with this one.Arkane, who have already long proven their prowess for non-linear level design with Dishonored 1&2 have outdone themselves with Prey.See that security station? There's these juicy Neuromods (skillpoints) inside, but you don't have the right code.Well, here is where Arkane Studios truly shines.To list some of the possiibilities to enter the station:- find out who worked in this station, track them using another computer, find them (or more likely, their corpse), get the keycode. - Hack the console to force the door open- Use the "Gloo Gun" (This thing is just nuts, the best gadget I have seen in my years of playing videogames) to build a staircase up the security station and enter from the vent- See this small gap in the (bulletproof) window? Put a mug or an apple or something small next to it, turn into that Apple (because Mimicry) and roll through like you own the place, then morph back. - The security console can be seen from the gap in the window, right? Might as well shoot the buttons on it with your trusty *Huntress Boltcaster*™ which has foam darts to deactivate the security lock.Get those Neuromods, invest them in a higher hacking skill, so next time you encounter a door such as this, you have one more skill in your repertoire. You see, on the surface, it's Bioshock, but below, it's just so much deeper in almost every regard.The best part is, you're never truly restricted.The Talos-1, the huge research space ship this game takes place on, is built like a metroidvania in many regards, which I absolutely adore.Sometimes you find a new gadget, receive a new superpower, unlock a new skill, and you're like hooool' up, can I now enter X place? So you go back, and you can. And you find new ♥♥♥♥, you find new logs, which point you towards a new direction on your self-bestowed quest to finally understand what exactly happened on the Talos-1.The combat in this game takes a similar approach as the security station described above.See these mimics? Well, they're not aware of you yet, they haven't morphed. If you trigger them, they will rush you and you will take damage, so let's play this smart.- Pew Pew them with your gun until they explode?- Throw an item next to a gas pipeline, shoot the gas, watch them burn?- Gloo™ them until they're glued in place, then take your sweet time throwing random items such as microscopes, wastebins, and any other thing that's not nailed down at them?- Sneak past them altogether? There seem to be some vents nearby, wonder where they lead?- Remember that automated turret you saw a few minutes ago? Wonder what'll do to them when you deploy it and just open the door.The possibilties are endless, and I truly hope that this game one day will receive the praise it really deserves.It feels like Bethesda threw money and the name "Prey" at Arkane and said "go nuts", and that's what they did.I really don't want to go into more detail than this, but know that for the low price of whatever you're gonna pay for this, you will get your moneys' worth.Here's to hoping that DEATHLOOP can top this absolute gem.;Recommended;56.1;2/08/2021;192;1
Bethesda Softworks;Prey;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;"The Bioshock sequel the Bioshock fan doesn't deserve because they didn't play it": Prey is a game I put in the "I can't believe this game exists" category. Every department on this game is firing on all cylinders delivering a cohesive, extremely well thought out, beautiful experience. The setting of this game is so well realized and crafted in a way to feel like a real, tangible place. IMO, this is the best sci-fi game ever made, the best game from the xbox one/ps4 gen that nobody played, and top 5 greatest games of all time. We will never get another game like this again, unfortunately. This game got swept under the rug by the "open world craze" from the x1/ps4 gen and it didnt perform the way it needed to.. The studio lost 75% of staff with redfall. People like to say the game's title was the core of the issue which is retarded. The IP was completely irrelevant at the time. If Ken Levine dickriders couldnt gather that the game was like Bioshock at some capacity when marketing promos are showing you using a wrench, then they werent going to respond positively to Neuroshock. The people behind the product are more valuable than the product itself. See Halo for more details.;Recommended;49.3;23/10/2023;287;6
Bethesda Softworks;Prey;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;To guide your  decision whether to buy this game  or not, please answer the following quick questions: 1. Do you like first person shooter?2. Do you like BIOSHOCK series?3. Do you like HALF LIFE series?4. Do you like a good quality, single player campaign with good story?5. Do you like a full, lengthy, satisfying game that does not cost you a kidney (like many big title AAA games out there nowadays)?6. Do you like a developer who gives you a full game without asking you to pay more for microtransactions, loot boxes?7. Do you like SYSTEM SHOCK series (for those who still remember this old classic game)? 8. Do you like a game that rewards you with careful exploration and completing side missions (although you totally don't have to if you don't want to)?9. Do you like DEUS EX - Human Revolution game that lets you choose multiple ways to complete your objective, each very unique, clear and cool? 10. Games with achievements? CONCLUSION: If your answer is yes to 6 or more of the above questions, then this is a   MUST BUY   for you, regardless of sale or no sale. If your answer is yes to less than 6 of the questions, you might consider   picking it up on SALE  . If your answer is no to all the above questions,  click  BACK  on your browser now . Update note:There is a new DLC called mooncrash, which is designed for Prey's fan. If you are tight on budget, you DO NOT need to buy it at all. It is more like an additional simulation game and does not contribute to the main game's story, nor does it play like the main game. It's made for hardcore PREY fans to kill time and additional content for them.;Recommended;99.8;21/06/2018;394;21
Bethesda Softworks;Prey;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;Prey.The mind game.IntroductionAfter finishing Prey and returning to the title screen, the first words that came out of my mouth were: "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ incredible." Many liken Prey to other FPS's as having copied their ideas, whether they be Bioshock, Deus Ex, or Half-Life. however I feel that Prey's mixture of its peers' concepts and its own nuances distinguishes itself in a tangible way. Most games, especially FPS's, impress in some regards but fail in others. By contrast, Prey exceeds all of its qualifying marks, reflecting a commitment to craftsmanship rare in modern gaming.PlotIt's hard to talk story specifics without spoiling, but here's some background on the game. Prey exists in an alternate timeline, where JFK's assassination attempt failed, and the US and Soviet Union eventually worked together on the space race. Fast forward to the year 2035, after a formerly Soviet space station named Kletka had been purchased, repurposed, and privatized by Transtar Industries. Kletka was retitled Talos I, and became a testing ground for Transtar's neuromod technology. Neuromods rewire pathways in the brain, granting new skills and fantastical powers. You play as the male or female VP of Transtar, Morgan Yu... an amnesiac and one of the stations few remaining survivors.PresentationChanging focus, Prey is a game that looks great, but could be better. All graphical details and visual effects are near photo-realistic, but that doesn't bear out to an interesting art style in this case. I'm being unfair to an extent, but I do expect a triple-A game from 2017 to be moderately more aesthetically pleasing than plain realism. On the other hand, I'm in love with Prey's masterpiece of an OST. as it's comprised of ominous, retro, synth heavy, and emotive tracks that fit flawlessly in place. Every element of the soundscape is impeccable, and builds up the atmosphere. Prey performs proficiently too. I had no crashes or bugs in my 28 hour playthrough. Altogether, the game displays itself with near-flying colors.Level DesignOne of Prey's key strengths is its setting and level structure. The Talos I is inherently macabre, as the towering, stark architecture in the depths of space is made further daunting by the corpses littering its atriums, corridors, and work spaces. The station is superbly designed from a gameplay perspective as well, as there are several paths toward objectives and different ways to use the environments to your advantage. This includes a liberating level of verticality, which switches up the tactile pacing and gets you to search for hidden spots all around Talos I. Every section of the ship is open to free-form exploration too, after you acquire access to them. In this sense, Prey certainly mirrors the philosophy of Deus Ex, and straddles the line of being an action-RPG.Gameplay Mechanics & DesignSpeaking of action, the gameplay of Prey is unbelievably smooth, challenging, and hectically enjoyable. The melee and gun combat is flashy and brutally satisfying, with meaty animations and sound effects. There are a variety of methods to deal damage to your enemies, which can be mixed and matched to produce elaborate combat styles. Stealth is another viable option, which functions just as well as you’d expect considering Prey is from the people who made Dishonored. What Yu can do is only half the fun though. Your adversaries are just as creative in combat as you are. Mimics are Prey's most recognizable creature. they're the aliens that turn into objects and then unexpectedly assault you before you can even react. There are at least a half dozen more enemy types, each of which require divergent tactics to eliminate. That's where neuromods, the psychoscope, and chipsets come in.Progression SystemNeuromods are basically Prey's leveling system, as using them gives access to perks and new powers. This starts at increasing your health pool, weapon damage, movement speed, etc.. but branches out into much more kick-@ss abilities once you unlock Typhon powers. The alien species that infected Talos I are known as Typhon's, and after you find the psychoscope, you can scan them (a la Bioshock) and use neuromods to gain their unique attributes. These skills range from turning into small objects like mimics, to summoning columns of fire to make a nice Typhon char-burger. Chipsets are comparatively tame, and simply modify the spacesuit and psychoscope to have extra functions in their own right.Gameplay FreedomThe mechanics don't end there though, as repair, hacking, and crafting perks support the gameplay experience too. These systems are frequently used to gain access to crucial resources, which are always in short supply. Putting all of these features together. the multifaceted level design, combat tactics, neuromod abilities, Typhon powers, item management, and brilliant enemy AI. results in an unavoidably taxing, inventive, and addictive gameplay loop. The player's freedom to truly make the gameplay their own with these mechanics is what takes the cake in the end. For me, this puts Prey up there with other classic FPS's, such as Half-Life and Deus Ex.Main Story & CharactersFinally getting back to the major storyline, it's a real doozy. Prey puts copious decisions in front of you throughout your playtime, usually to do with how you treat the small cast of main characters and other survivors aboard Talos I. These personas are seen sparingly, but are each intrinsically valuable to the narrative. They're also believable as people, who prod you into caring about their lives, and the predicaments they're in. Shades of gray pervade every available choice though, little is ever presented as solely right or wrong. This culminates at an astonishing finale, one which made so much sense and judged you by your actions, and yet was also so overwhelmingly surreal. Outside of the central story are side tales too. often leading to side quests.Side Quests & LoreWhile traversing the ship, surrounded by bodies, you'll come across a number of audio logs and emails mislaid by the dead crew. Listening to and reading their final thoughts do wonders toward bringing the world and story to life, in a relatably human way. These final thoughts provide side objectives as well, which make the game feel less linear - and once again - more like an action-RPG. The two critiques I have of them is that the ancillary quests require far too much backtracking, and about a quarter of them feel like filler that don't carry any real weight in terms of gameplay or narrative. They're assuredly a positive addition to Prey though, just a bit rushed.ConclusionI've resolved to hold out on talking any more about the story, as Prey is a game that thrives on surprising the player, as much as it thrives on decision-making. While I've explained my scant irritations with the game, I hope my great amount of praise for it speaks much louder. Prey absolutely went above and beyond my expectations, and is now one of my favorite games of all time. The terrific gameplay and fascinating narrative made sure of that. A supreme quantity of variability in combat and writing guarantees multiple worthwhile replays too. An experience that is wholly singular is what Prey offers, and it's one I'd recommend to any, and every gamer.Personal Rating: 9.5/10 - Categorically Phenomenal;Recommended;30.6;23/07/2018;240;4
Bethesda Softworks;Prey;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;12th May UPDATED: Finished my first playthrough on Hard difficulty, it consisted of zero human kills and zero selection of Typhon powers. Time taken 38hours   PROS: +Starts with strong opening sequence and ends with a mind♥♥♥♥ of an ending.+Retains Arkane's signature style art direction and world-building.+Top-notch level design, featuring a bevvy of secret rooms and missable stuffs.+Surprisingly challenging difficulty, even encounters with smallest of mimics is unnerving.+Well-executed physics. Almost anything you see in a given place can be picked up and interacted with.+Complex, Intriguing storyline. adapts a meticulous "show, don't tell" narrative approach.+Replay incentives come in form of multiple endings and preferred skill builds.+PC Version is well optimised. unlike Dishonored 2. The controls and UI feel like they were made with KB/M in mind. CONS:  -Heavy backtracking may off some, especially in the last moments of the game.-Same goes for clunky gunplay, which is intentional design.-Players going for a stealth build will suffer in the long run since both stealth perks and mechanics are basic. VERDICT: Inspite of some glaring issues, Prey is one of the best PC titles since ages. Everything about it screams classic PC titles, from the System shock like aesthetics to the user interface. and it feels fresh to see devs who aren't pulling their punches or empowering the player with little effort.Prey belongs to the breed of thinking-man shooters which we don't see getting made nowadays, it's definitely a niche title.It not just demands player intelligence, it expects it.That said, Prey is NOT everyone's cup of tea. Some may get hooked right off the bat while some may uninstall after a few minutes with the game. But from my end, it's a BUY for whoever can accept it's weirdness and challenge.;Recommended;59.1;8/05/2017;450;14

Capcom;Resident Evil 2;Action;R$ 139,90;This game is what other developers should aspire to when creating a remake. It is hands down the best remake I have ever played.I remember getting this game for my birthday in third grade and my little brother watched me play for what felt like an eternity. That sparked my brothers' obsession with the resident evil franchise. I, however, did not play much of the following titles in the series. I would watch him here and there and watched the movies. I ended up getting an Xbox and Halo was my obsession. With the remake of the third one and RE: Village on the way I figured it was finally time for me to really wet my whistle with what Capcom has to offer. This game is by far more terrifying than anything I remember playing in third grade. Parts in the original that have been implanted into my cerebral cortex out of sheer terror back then have now manifested themselves into brand new nightmares thanks to the modern revamp of the games engine with the graphics being some of the most realistic horrors I've seen even in Hollywood movies. I'm on my third or fourth playthrough and I still scream like a little girl at parts. The game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrifying. Between lickers popping out of vents, the 15-foot terminator known as Mr. X chasing you all over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ place, zombies behind doors, in lockers to WHATEVER THE HELL those things in the sewers are... it's enough to give you a glimpse into quite possibly, what Hell is. Iconic cutscenes, boss introductions, and other favoritable parts have been altered or changed in a way that keeps the game fresh but still so grounded to its core roots. Giving new players a great and new experience while giving the veteran players something to smile at in nostalgia. Perhaps one of my favorite things in this game is the dismemberment. Really gives you that dead space sense of cutting your enemies down to a meat sack of nothing before pumping a few more rounds into their heads to make sure they're not getting back up. The only thing I wish this game had was more content. Yes, I know there are bonus missions but that still is not enough. I just want more. Sadly,  the RE3 remake ain't it.

Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the "meta" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. What more could you want?;Recommended;1,228.4;13/06/2020;756;18
Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;Most enjoyable grind everI’m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers. ProsGood graphicsA lot of contentVery challengingA lot of monsters to huntNo p2w crapNice coopConsPerformance could be slightly betterWhile there are a lot of monsters, many of them feel too similar to each otherMy curator page;Recommended;106.9;6/06/2019;550;20
Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;Edit: Just an update on this review. After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.Previous Review:This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game.;Recommended;388.0;23/03/2021;1,281;11

Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;I'm in my mid 40's so I don't always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter: World has me hooked. Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun.;Recommended;103.6;21/08/2019;537;13
Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;Now that this game has gotten a resurgence, here's a PSA.There's something called the Defender's Set in the beginning of the game. Now MH does nothing to explain it but it is basically endgame quality gear blueprint given to everyone in the forge from the beginning of the game. It's basically a means for players to speedrun their way through the game to reach Iceborne, the expansion. Literally speedrunning because the weapons do so much damage that it negates every reason to interact with basically every mechanic in the game. Monster weaknesses, equipment types, literally any reason to pop open the hunter guide, look at what a monster is weak to, where its weakness is, and what elements might help. All of this is useless with the Defender Set. Farming materials to make the next tier of gear, progressively getting stronger and basically interacting with the ladder of equipment or crafting as a whole is negated as well.If you want to play Monster Hunter with all its features, don't use the Defender Set. Because in the end the game is about the journey, not the destination. Learning how to be a monster hunter, and how to hunt well for your class is exceptionally fun in this game.But by all means if you want to breeze through this game, blowing past the entire base game just to reach the expansion where you'll most definitely get your ass kicked because you don't know the mechanics of the game, go ahead. In the end you're either learning the game in the beginning, or learning the game in the end. Benefits of learning the game in the beginning is that you have more content. Negatives of learning the game later is that you just wasted the base game away for no reason.;Recommended;30.7;31/12/2023;743;12
Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, "do all the quests." Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!;Recommended;867.8;9/11/2018;780;25
Capcom;Monster Hunter: World;Action;R$ 99,90;Pretty fun, both solo and multi, don't believe the mixed reviews those were all due to the bad launch, the game is a very solid edition to the franchise and as its own game.

Capcom;Devil May Cry 5;Action;R$ 99,90;Quick SummaryDevil May Cry 5 (DMC5) is an excellent game that has a very in-depth combat and skills, along with a high skill ceiling. It also sports gorgeous visuals thanks to the RE engine, and various characters that all play differently and keep the whole thing feeling fresh. Environments are varied with hidden secrets, challenges, and alternative routes. The cutscenes are just as high quality as the gameplay itself, with a variety of interesting characters and interesting twists. ProsFantastic graphics and visualsGreat optimizationAn absolute banger of a soundtrack, that fits the game perfectlyHuge variety of enemies and bossesVery in-depth combat system with tons of skills and weapons to unlock and upgradeInteresting story with unique and memorable charactersHighly replay-ableCons One character is very simplistic to play  For new comers, the skills and different characters can be overwhelming Some of the combat arenas become predictable Any key skips a cutscene with no warning (including tab + shift for steam overlay)  Camera angle with keyboard and mouse is often jankyStory*No Spoilers* DMC5 has a pretty interesting story that most players will appreciate after having played the previous games. However, for newcomers, it’s still fairly easy to follow as the game has a fairly lengthy introductory cutscene, along with gradual tutorials that also give you lore at the same time. All of the characters are well developed and playing as different ones at varying times in the story adds a lot to the experience as well. Having plenty of cutscenes was a nice change of pace from all the murder and mayhem, as fun as that was. Overall, the story in DMC is very well done and ties into the old games, but is still accessible to newcomers (though players would benefit from watching a synopsis at least).  GameplayThis is where the meat of this game is. And also, where you will take a lot of meat out of demons (because hey, they deserve it). The gameplay in DMC5 is smooth, brutal, and requires fast reflexes. It feels like riding a roller coaster that you’re not wearing a seat belt on… increasingly exciting and invigorating, but if you lose control and thus your groove, you will be punished. One additional note is that the game seems to encourage multiple playthroughs, since you cannot unlock everything the first time through and you unlock additional modes or further upgrades upon your first campaign completion. The gameplay can roughly be divided into a few categories, though with some overlap: Combat, Skills, Items, and Exploration.The combatThe combat in DMC5 is essentially third person hack and slash with lots of different combos or skills you can utilize. A very important fact to keep in mind is that combat varies greatly between characters as well, so you can expect a large amount of variety. The battles primarily take place inside a locked arena (similar to Doom 2016) which means there is truly no escape, and you must fight to the death. There are a few roaming enemies throughout the course of the game but most of the battles are very focused, intentional events. Correctly making combo moves and switching up attack styles quickly results in a higher score in your missions, with the highest being “SSS”. Most combat consists of a primary attack using some sort of melee weapon (like a sword or fists), with a secondary attack that is often ranged (like a revolver or shotgun). Another important element is the “lock-on” feature that lets you concentrate on a specific enemy, and which also acts as a modifier for certain attacks. In addition, enemy attacks can often be countered or dodged with the correct time and combination of keys.  SkillsBranching out from these basic attacks, are skills and movements you can unlock that all can be affected by different keys or buttons. A single primary attack can be totally different by simply using your forward action or reverse action, or holding lock on with a movement key. The upgrade system really goes insanely in-depth here, providing the player the opportunity to really experiment and find the skills they enjoy. Skills are unlocked with red orbs which are essentially in-game currency, that is dropped from kills and can also be found scattered throughout the maps. As the game progresses, a lot of new and different ultimate skills can be unlocked, that push the combat ability to the max. Depending on the character, some truly devastating powers can be unleashed that knock all but the most powerful demons into bits. These ultimate powers however take time to charge and can be replenished in various but limited ways. ItemsDMC5 also allows item utilization to aid players in beating it. For instance, there are certain orbs you can pick up that restore your health, or permanently upgrade it. One orb will revive you on the spot if you die in a battle. This does however reduce your score level in the mission. There are various weapons and items you can select from before you start a mission, essentially customizing your loadout.ExplorationFinally, exploration actually plays a pretty significant part in DMC5. For all the vicious combat and lively action, there is a surprising amount of hidden secrets that reveal extra missions or items. Also, there are a few small environmental puzzles that you need to figure out to progress, but they are nothing complicated. Often times, exploration will really help with future battles since you can find important upgrades or even replenish health before a boss.Graphics and VisualsGraphics and optimization are where DMC5 really shines. The character faces and animations are impeccable, and the environments are detailed with fantastic atmosphere. The combat is only made better because of this, as there is nothing quite like seeing high resolution demon blood flying across the screen! SoundDMC5 has very well-designed audio, with lots of audio cues and combat that provides plenty of feedback. The only audio-related aspect that really stood out in a good way, was the soundtrack. DMC5 frankly has an amazing soundtrack, with really memorable tracks that fit perfectly to the high intensity combat. Another cool detail is the music intensity increases with the score the player racks up during combat. I still find myself playing the songs after completing the game and headbanging along with them.Bugs, Glitches and CrashesI did experience one bug with the game. After using Steam overlay, a couple times the game wouldn’t fully recognize my input and so I couldn’t move or switch weapons. I had to reload a checkpoint to get around this. Another technical complaint I have is that the cutscenes will skip with the press of any key, so keep your fingers off the keyboard if you want to watch the cutscenes. However, you CAN re-watch cutscenes from the main menu. Price… is it worth it?DMC5 is currently listed at $59.99, which is typical for a newer AAA game. For true fans of the DMC franchise, this price is easily worth it because of how re-playable the game is and a decently long campaign. For newcomers such as myself, I got the game on the most recent sale for $19 which was definitely a bargain for the high-quality experience.ConclusionIn conclusion, DMC5 seems to be a nearly flawless addition to the DMC franchise with lots of fluid and technical combat, an intense story, and absolutely gorgeous visuals. For someone completely new to the franchise and even to the genre, it is worth picking up on sale and obliterating some demons.

Capcom;Street Fighter V;Action;R$ 84,00;All the frustration of a freemium game economy, whilst still having to pay a traditional game's up front costs. I got this game on sale, and still honestly feel ripped off. With the base version of the game, the majority of the the content is hidden behind a pay wall. Including most importantly the characters, I would be fine if it was just cosmetics, but over half the cast is inaccessible (don't even get me started on the stages, music, cosmetics etc). Was genuinely shocked to discover that Capcom's reaction to people's frustration with how slow in game currency was earnt at release, was to cut income even further! now the only way to get fight money (the in game currency), is through levelling up, or from online matches. The online matches give you 50 fight money for a win, for context to unlock a character is 100,000......yeah (new stages are 70,000, costumes are 40,000). That should tell you everything about the game's economy you need to know. The sad thing is the game itself is pretty good, what little you get to play of it anyway. I have loved street fighter since I first played SF2 in the arcades.But what capcom did with SF5 has really soured my view of any future involvement with the series. This is all obviously done in a cynical attempt to squeeze more money out of their costumers (who again have already paid for the base game), but i'm not spending another penny on this game, this anti consumer BS needs to end.;Not Recommended;603.6;3/12/2018;1,426;16

Capcom;Street Fighter V;Action;R$ 84,00;After many hours, a great number of ranked matches and late night lobbies, and a couple local tournaments, I can finally say confidently that I do not recommend this game.The singleplayer content is barebones and not at all worth playing. This is fine in a competitive fighting game, since the focus is more on competitive multiplayer. If you're not interested in that, take a hard pass on Street Fighter V and play a fighting game with worthwhile singleplayer content. Guilty Gear Xrd is a good one.Mechanically, the game isn't bad at all. It's fairly simple, with a modest amount of easy to understand mechanics that lead to interesting gameplay. It's also popular, so you can always find people online to play with. It's not a difficult game to pick up, and it's more accessible and rewarding than most other fighting games. That said, I still have a few problems with the gameplay.Namely:* Defensive options are awful. This is why high level play is just watching people do meaty setups on eachother. It's also why throw loops are as prevalent as they are.* Questionable design decisions, such as removing frame 1 invuln from all meterless DPs. This really skews the risk/reward of those moves, which is an odd choice from a game franchise that's so rooted in pure and simple fighting game fundamentals.* Timing is sort of strange. It's a game with 3 frame normals, so things like blockstrings and meaty attacks need to be pretty airtight. If they're not (and it's hard for them to be with any sort of network stutter in the mix) then mashing light buttons will get you out of a lot of situations. This should be a bad habit, but it's rewarding in this game for some reason.* The input delay/netcode makes it feel pretty unresponsive. If you're coming from other fighting games, expect to get hit by many fullscreen moves (Balrog's rush punches, Cammy's EX spiral arrow, Ken's EX tatsu) if you don't block preemptively.In terms of everything aside from the gameplay, it's an inexcusable travesty. The netcode is terrible, and even on wired connections with people in my own hometown it feels jerky and frustrating. Other fighting games add input delay, or seem to run the game in slow motion. SFV just teleports you from one connected attack to the next so you can watch yourself die in a jerky mess of unreactable attacks. The netcode also seems to send all the lag to the person with better internet. I remember having a really good night on ranked with seemingly stable connections and slow witted opponents, only to later realize I had been torrenting and my sister had been watching Netflix, presumably sending all the lag to my opponents.Unlocking characters, costumes, colors, and stages requires either making microtransactions with real world money, or spending ingame currency, which is extremely limited and for the most part non-renewable. You get 50 fight money for a win in a ranked match, zero for a loss. Characters cost 100,000 fight money each. You do the math. All the good cosmetics in this game are behind paywalls that you'd expect to see in free to play games. But it's a full price triple-A title, and the character season passes are also inexcusably expensive.Capcom has been pretty terrible with supporting this game as well. Patches are frequently delayed by weeks if not months, and it's missing many quality of life changes that should have been included at time of release (eg. saving battle lounge settings when the game closes, or being able to skip the awful tutorial on a fresh install). They also straight up lied about a Linux release. That was supposed to happen concurrent with the Windows release, but there has been no word from Capcom on that front.I could go on. There's been a very long train of disappointments with this game, and you shouldn't hop on it. Maybe they'll release Super Street Fighter V as the rumors say, and then I'll give this review another revision, but I don't see things changing for the better. The game is still going to be expensive, laggy, and unsatisfying. But it's got a lot of players, so it's got that going for it.Crossplay is very nice though. I wish more fighting games had that.;Not Recommended;168.0;18/07/2017;222;2

Capcom;Mega Man 11;Action;R$ 99,90;(Played through on Superhero Mode)Without wasting any time, if you are a Mega Man fan, you probably already have the game. If you haven't played Mega Man before, or aren't certain if you will enjoy it, the selectable difficulty modes really open up the game to first-timers so you can continuously retry without running out of chances, so don't fret.(Length)The stages are heavily based on the NES styled titles, with large rooms and unique gimmicks. There are 8 Main Stages, 2 Wily Stages, a simple Boss Capsule Refight Stage, and a short ride to the Final Battle. There is no intro stage in this game, which is a minor disappointment. The total amount of content is brisk, so if you know what you are doing, expect to complete the game in a few hours, tops.The extra modes pad out the content a little, but the entire point of this game is to challenge yourself. You can get a lot of replay value out of trying to play the game without using special weapons or the gear system, essentially replaying the same content with restrictions to unlock achievements or self improvement.(Balance)There are only two areas I can recall where you get trapped into taking a hit, one in Blastman's stage, and one in Impact Man's. Unless you have foresight, you will likely take a hit there. Thankfully, there is no such forced hit involving instant death. All falling blocks and spikes are clearly telegraphed, and any player skillful enough can feasibly avoid such obstacles without unfair deaths.E-Tank Spam trivializes a lot of the difficulty on all modes, but especially the easier ones, due to the sheer amount of bolts that drop. E-Tanks only cost 100 bolts a pop, and you can walk out of a stage with 1000+ if you pick up every drop. You simply never run out of these things, which means most of the game can be beaten by standing on top of bosses and tanking the damage while you burn the bosses down, chugging E-Tanks every so often. This is only a problem if you choose to use this form of recovery, though.Everything felt great playing Buster Only, so if you are interested in a playthrough without powers or special weapons, look forward to an excellent challenge.(Weapons)The special weapons in this game are easily among the most powerful in a long line of games. They have very generous hitboxes and have enormous utility, making almost all of them a pure upgrade over your default buster. Power Gear toggling just to wipe the screen with overwhelming special weapons feels extremely nice.In addition, there is a new option to change your special weapons with the right control stick. It has never been easier to utilize these things.(Soundtrack)Although music is a very subjective thing, I have to say that I found the vast majority of the soundtrack to be utterly forgettable. This is very much a soundtrack made for a newer age, and felt much more modernized than ever before. You won't find the same level of catchy melodies as any of the past Mega Man titles. None of the music is outright bad, but it pains you much moreso when the series is known for such well made music and you end the experience without any of the tunes stuck in your head.(Final Notes)The game is short and sweet. There are really just 10 meaty stages with a few extra short walks to the final bosses. You will get your money's worth if you decide to try the higher difficulties or want to play the side modes, but they are more of the same. If you enjoy challenging yourself, grab this for sure. If you are more of a "variety" gamer and will only play this once, you might only get 3-5 hours out of it, so do keep that in mind.If you want to see this series prosper, you really owe it to yourself to support the Blue Bomber so that his games may continue. The sales are essentially votes, so vote with your wallet! Welcome back, buddy. MIssed ya.;Recommended;33.6;2/10/2018;77;1

Capcom;Mega Man 11;Action;R$ 99,90;A lot better than i expected it to be.There's really only two complaints i have with this game:The music isn't as spectacular as everyone hoped.  Mega Man games have routinely had top notch exceptional music soundtracks, every song being an instant classic.  In this one however the music is very forgettable and almost unnoticeable in comparison.  That being said there is many music conversion packs people have created and will create to rectify this problem (The most recent one i tried was the 8-bit version)..The only other complaint i have is minor, in that it's hard to tell where Mega Man's hit box is so jumping in tight areas like Torch Man stage gets a little frustrating, but you can get use to that.Also, there's really only 2 full Wily stages (not including Wily and the re-fights), but all the robot master levels are longer than normal so it kind of makes up for it.  Still a bit of a disappointment when you get there, but it's not a huge deal.  One more Wily level probably would have done the trick.Overall, very nicely done.  Might be controversial, but I might even consider it to be in the top 5 if not top 3 best classic Mega Man games (classic meaning 1-11 not including the X or Zero series, which i have actually not played yet).------------------------------Control Scheme I Used:Gamepad defaults with D-Pad for movement.  May have rebound auto fire button.------------------------------Worth the current price (CDN$ 39.99)?  This might be a hard sell, even fans of Mega Man.What I actually paid: $31.99------------------------------Completionist Review:DLC Achievements:  NoneRating:  There's a fair bit of workCan be completed in one run:  No, there's challenges and things outside the main game.Chapter Select: Kind of, you can pick the level order, and which challenges to start.Did I need/use a guide?  No.Lots of things to get here for achievements, including a speedrun, which took a couple attempts.  Overall lots of fun though really, and the challenges are different and interesting for the most part.;Recommended;63.8;22/11/2018;38;1
Capcom;Mega Man 11;Action;R$ 99,90;Summary: They got it right!Mega Man 11 is a revival of the 30 (or 31 if you're from Japan) year old series, and it seriously seems like they listened to fan input along the way. Mega Man regains all of his core moves: running and jumping, but also sliding and charge shot. In addition, if you wish to use the gears, you absolutely can. They enhance your speed and your weapons, but overall they make the game easier. You can actually beat the full game buster only, and that's one of the areas in which they were clearly listening to the fans.The controls are tight as ever, though bear in mind that using a wireless controller or analog stick will not effectively replicate the feel of the classic series in its prime. Thankfully, there is generic gamepad support, even though it uses Xbox button icons to represent said gamepad's buttons and can get confusing. Want to play on an SNES controller? No problem -- I finished the game doing so! You'll need a couple more buttons to use everything, however.Of note, Mega Man's jump distance has been increased by around 25%, likely to facilitate the switch to widescreen. Aside from that, however, it'll feel more like playing Mega Man 4 or 5 than any other title.The graphics are beautiful, though the perspectives used in cutscenes are a bit limited. Obviously core gameplay should lock it as is done, but cutscenes don't need to be beholden to these limitations. The audio is catchy as ever, though default settings really drown out its wonderful soundtrack. I'd recommend adjusting the voices and SFX down a bit before beginning.If you're worried about replayability, challenges have you covered. The developers made good use of the fairly short roster of maps to design some clever, if not incredibly evil challenges. Getting gold on them will keep you busy for quite some time.A few people have mentioned slowdown issues similar to those experienced in the Legacy Collections. Luckily, I didn't experience this, in spite of having slowdown in LC2 and XLC1. It seems to be fairly rare.That aside, with the difficulty vets expect and the easier difficulty settings making it accessible to newcomers, this is a fantastic run-and-gun for anyone.(also, I will throw my money at any Bass DLC Capcom shoves at me);Recommended;24.7;3/10/2018;51;2

Capcom;Mega Man 11;Action;R$ 99,90;Mega Man 11Rock em, sock emReviewAfter an eight year absence, I am happy to report that Mega Man 11 succeeds, but there are a few caveats. Let's be honest: it wouldn't take much for Mega Man 11 to not succeed in the eyes of the fans when you are springboarding off 2003's lacklustre, dead-in-it's tracks Mega Man X7 (which tried to transition the series into 3D with disastrous results), which only ended up taking the franchise to new levels of low that nearly saw the blue bomber tumble into notoriety with fans himself. The follow-up, Mega Man X8, didn't do much to elevate the franchise out of the muck within which it had found itself, with X8 never rising above mediocre. Many of us fans thought Mega Man was on his way to the retirement village to be sunsetted by Capcom after the throwback Mega Man 10 was released in 2010 feeling like a cash-in. The years long radio silence after that only further made it seem like Capcom had no clear path forward for the blue bomber and  fans started to wonder whether the franchise was finally on life support.I will admit, as a huge fan of the late eighties originals of which Mega Man 2 is the high point, the return announcement in 2017 did catch me off guard. With creator Keiji Inafune now having moved on from Capcom, how could Capcom ever do without Inafune guiding the series back to life? Although we would soon all learn that Inafune's best days were probably behind him too after Mighty No. 9 failed to emerge successfully from under the shackles of the Mega Man franchise, ending up an inferior product in almost every conceivable way from from mascot, to robot bosses, to world, and finally extended to the villain. The next question was with Inafune gone, could Capcom ever make the blue bomber relevant again?Sadly, no as it seems like the days of Mega Man's relevance have long passed and are now assigned to history for keeping. When we first met him in 1987, platformers were the rock star's of gaming. They sold systems by virtue of the mascot alone  Now you would be lucky to find a big publisher willing to fund one outside of Nintendo. While the genre did have a bit of a resurgence in the early noughties when they went 3D and became gobbledegook collectathons, its mostly fallen to indie studios to keep the genre alive and quite frankly they have been doing a sterling job. Just look at some of the crazy and wonderful things with the genre they have been doing (Super Meat Boy and Celeste are classic examples of this). In many ways it kind of feels like the game succeeds by virtue of simply existing, especially for us fans starved of his presence but Capcom does a fairly good job of taking the series and modernising some of its mechanics but that is where it stops because the rest of the formula remains untouched from the original game - a blueprint that has been subsequently adhered to rigidly throughout the long running series. This legacy design that the series keeps on insisting including is now starting to feel more than a little archaic, ensuring there are very little to no surprises with each new release. It's at the point now where its become the franchises Achilles heel. You won't find any platforming moments of brilliance here, like the kinds of stuff on display in Celeste or Hollow Knight. It plays it very safe and is clearly made for long standing fans of the series, as if Capcom knew it was treading on thin ice with them.If you were never much of a fan of the series, then Mega Man 11 is going to do little, if anything, to turn that around. Another thing I must mention is that it is also insanely hard, and that is probably going to drive a lot of people away. I had to drop it from normal difficulty (which is advised for mainstays of the series which I consider myself) to easy mode and I still struggled like mad to make headway with it. The first three Mega Man games are considered to be amongst the hardest games ever created, yet I could clear Mega Man 1/2 and Mega Man 3 in a single sitting back in the day while typing text messages to my dentist and doing tax calculations for my tax return. Yet here I couldn't even get through a single level of repeated trying in the five or so hours I banged my head against the normal difficulty before resigning myself to the fact that I must now officially be an old fart who has to play on baby settings.As a fan I appreciate that Capcom has brought Mega Man back from the dead and I appreciate the graphical update to modern HD graphics. Mega Man has never looked more clearer although I would love to see the series return back to its pixel roots, BUT when I say pixel, I am speaking along the lines of the gorgeous indie platform Kings and Queens of our current era (Celeste, Blasphemous or even better yet Children of Morta which has these incredibly highly detailed pixel counts that look utterly gorgeous) and not the 8-bit revival of Mega Man 10. The reality here is that Mega Man 11 is not the return to form sequel many would have you believe. It's enjoyable but it's also not enjoyable to play in equal measure and is not one of his better adventures. I also found the eight Dr. Wily robots you need to defeat a little underwhelming from a mechanics and design standpoint. If Capcom is to continue Mega Man's adventures into the future, then I certainly hope they look into the history of the most celebrated and beloved platformers of our modern era that have all, almost exclusively, sprung from the indie scene because that is where Mega Man's true innovation and salvation lies. There is no point in trying to revive his best days. Let history keep record of those.One word or phrase to sum up the experienceFor the fansPerformance/Bug related incidentsNone, should run easily on most hardware as the game is not demanding on CPU or GPU.Similar to gamesMega Man 2, Celeste, Might No. 9Rating ★★★★★★★☆☆☆https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869453510;Recommended;25.6;7/04/2021;44;1

Bandai Namco Entertainment;Dragon Ball FighterZ;Action;R$ 232,50;The gameplay is pretty good, but what's more important is the number of Gokus. If you look at the math, there's actually many more Gokus in this game than one might expect. Of course, we've got the three main Gokus, but there's also Vegito, who is 0.5 Gokus due to being a fusion with Vegeta. Then, we have Gohan, who is half Goku and half Chi-Chi, making him also 0.5 Gokus, so since we have two of him, this brings our current total to 4.5 Gokus. We've also got Gotenks. Gotenks is 0.25 Gokus, because he is both a child and a fusion. Now our total is 4.75.There's also Goku Black. While he has the mind of Zamasu, his body is 100% Goku, making him count as one Goku nonetheless. Fused Zamasu is 50% Goku Black, making him also 0.5 Gokus.Next, Bardock. Goku is 50% Bardock, which in turn means that Bardock is 200% Goku, making him two whole Gokus. This brings our total to 8.25 Gokus.Perfect Cell and Android 21 are kinda weird, but according to a commenter Perfect Cell is 0.166 Gokus, and Android 21 is 0.151 Gokus, which brings us to a total of 8.567 Gokus.With the FighterZ Pass 2 giving us GT Goku and SSB Gogeta, we now have another one and a half Gokus, but the new pass also brings us the Great Saiyaman as part of Videl's moveset, which is another half Goku, bringing the current total number of Gokus to 10.567.And with FighterZ Pass 3 we have been given yet another Goku, this time in his Ultra Instinct form, as well as another fusion in the form of SSJ4 Gogeta, which brings the total to 12.067.;Recommended;56.0;9/08/2018;552;1,1

This is it. It's not a gritty reboot, Wolverine won't lose three daughters in a pile of gore- there's no grey on grey main character who's so cynical your eyes bleed facing off against an enemy written to have a good point really, because the world is terrible and Thanos is probably right. You help a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ catboy make a happy kingdom.Is it hard? No, it isn't. Probably not even at highest levels.

Bandai Namco Entertainment;Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom;Adventure, RPG;R$ 257,90;Score: 9/10Time to Complete: Approx 35 hours (without sidequests)Time to 100%: 70 hoursSimilar games: Tales of Berseria, Final Fantasy XVSince being a huge fan of both Studio Ghibli and the previous Ni No Kuni game (bought a PS3 back in the day just to play it!) I had high hopes for this and it didn't disappoint. From beginning to end I was grossly absored in it's many mechanics and couldn't put it down until I had done as much as I could. An absolutely addictive gem to play from start to finish.PROS:Just so much content! - From upgrading weapons and armour, finding collectible creatures called Higgeldies and leveling them, managing your castle, recruiting civilians, traversing deram-door labyrinths for loot and levels, to army-scale skirmishes and hunting down darkness-riddled monsters: This game has SO SO MUCH to do. So much so that it's easy to get addicted to one element of the game and then switch to another when you need a break. So much so that it hits this sweet spot of always being fun and having something to do. Let me tell you, the most addictive part of this game is easily recruiting civilians. It's like Mother Base from Metal Gear Solid 5 all over again! But you know, with cutesy Japanime charm. Ghibli Magic - This is a game that is absolutely beautiful, from its sound design to its art direction, everything shines with that Ghibli magic (although the studio themselves where not directly involved in this game like they were in the first). The effort involved to make the game's primary cityscapes is simply lovely and very enjoyable to traverse through. It also has some nice little touches that some would overlook, but others would appreciate. For example, in a later Chinatown inspired area you meet people with names similar to Chinese ones, while also being influenced by their race/profession. Like Bao Wow the dog or Nu Bi the newbie apprentice. Like I said, the game is full of little things like this that make me smile. As a brief sidenote, I think this is an excellent game for a parent to recommend to their child if they want them to get into RPGs like I did when I was a wee little'un.CONS:Underdeveloped characters - For all it's multifaceted gameplay mechanics and lovely looks which will keep you engaged and absorbed from start to finish, the actual group of companions feel very much underdeveloped - with the exception of Evan and Roland. People will join your ragtag group for very little rhyme or reason and you don't really understand much of their motives, nor develop their characters any further. They very much take a back seat in these regards and I can only assume because greater emphasis was placed on city-building and exploration.Another issue is that sometimes during key points in the story the development process felt very hot and cold. Some of the time no expense is spared for the voice acting and character animation while at others it's very diluted. Understandable in the pointless fetch quests that populate the game, but quite often this happens during key dialogues as well which I felt hampered the emotional gravitass of those moments. Difficulty? - For the entirity of my playthrough, barring a small handfull of endgame content (looking at you, Faraway Forrest) - this game was shockingly easy. Does a game need to be difficult to be good? No, not at all, so I only consider this a minor issue. But I did find it rather peculiar when going up against a boss they would die very, very quickly - sometimes even within seconds. I'm not bragging saying that I must be some kind of pro-tier gamer - look at me! look how easy this is! - but quite the opposite, I played the game no different from any other RPG I play. My only reasoning for the ease of gameplay is that it's not that important to the game overall, and that it also attracts both a wider and younger demographic. Which is understandable. Speed - Another minor gripe. Your character moves REALLY FREAKING SLOWLY LIKE through the game world and it isn't until several hours in can you get a slight speed boost, but it's still annoying to have your character move really slowly through all these big, long dungeons that you just have to keep mashing the dodge button just to get the tiniest little boost. So in conclusion - although I must admit - it does feel clear that Studio Ghibli very much stepped back from this game, as it lacks the animated cutscenes and emotional resonance that the first game packed, I still found myself full of child-like glee and wonder. Is this game better than its predecessor? No. Do you need to play the first to enjoy this one? No. Is this still an excellent game and one I would recommend to any RPG enthusiast/fan of lovely animations? 100% YES!;Recommended;69.1;28/03/2018;221;4

Bandai Namco Entertainment;Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom;Adventure, RPG;R$ 257,90;Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.Let's start talking about the negatives: - the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in thereNow the "neutral" points:- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.- The story is simple. i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.Now for the good aspects:- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit- The random dungeons are cool to exploreI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and "tactical" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.;Recommended;85.4;6/11/2018;132;5
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom;Adventure, RPG;R$ 257,90;Good lord, this is another game that barely moves the needle past the 'recommend' threshold. If ever there was a case for a 'thumbs sideways' option, this is it. As a game, this oddly enough reminds me a lot of Dragon Age 2, in that it's about 15 hours of prime content smeared across an endless mountain of filler. Also similar to that game, the entire production feels distinctly like a B team effort, whether due to budget or time constraints. While my feelings on the first game are a bit mixed, I can't deny the love, passion, and craftsmanship that went into it. All of that is still apparent in places here, but there seems to be a lot less of it to go around.The chief reason for my recommend is the core gameplay, which I enjoyed a lot more than the first game. Applying Dragon Quest balance and grind to a monster collecting game with over 200 creatures was not a great idea, so I'm not sad to see it go for this entry. The real time combat here is punchy, responsive, and feels good for the most part.  The game skews towards the easy side, but wacking monsters is satisfying enough that it didn't get old for me. Combat is also supplemented by a few inspired subsystems, like the tactics tweaker, which allows you to spend points to determine victory bonuses, strengths, and resistances for your party. The game also includes limited tactical battles featuring armies, which actually ended up being very intuitive and were instantly legible to me despite a lack of experience in RTS games. While they're by nature a bit clunkier than the standard battles, they do serve as a nice change of pace from the moment to moment gameplay.As for negatives, lets start with the story: It's awful. Let me explain by way of an anecdote from early in the game. At one point your party are captured by bandits. This group ruthlessly murders anyone who happens into there territory, and have probably done so for dozens of helpless refugees who already passed through the area before you. The bandit lieutenant sneers sadistically as he puts you on your knees, presses his crossbow to your head, and prepares to pull the trigger. If, at this point, you guessed that an hour later these people would be among your most trusted friends, you were correct. The game doesn't even retcon their habit of murdering people, in fact they even seem proud of it when it's mentioned. Throughout the story, the radical forgiveness trope is really stretched to ludicrous extremes, with seemingly no crime being too heinous or sadistic to be hand waved away with a convenient 11th hour change of heart. Redemption really needs to be sold in cases like this, and if it isn't believable forgiveness feels like a cheap way to avoid resolving real moral conundrums of accountability and guilt. The plot is also undermined by a lack of visible character development for the main character Evan. Despite the tragedies and injustices he suffers early in the story, Evan remains irrepressibly upbeat for almost the entirety of the game. Rather than a 'stiff upper lip' kind of cheerfulness, Evan seems blissfully indifferent to his losses for almost the entirety of the game. That makes it all the more obnoxious at times when the game pats him on the back for 'how much he's grown', despite none of it having played out in any meaningful way for the player. It's definitely a case of tell, don't show, which once again comes off as extremely cheap and lazy writing. The worst part of this game is how 'spread thin' everything feels. The overworld seems much larger this time, but it's lost the painterly attention to detail the first game had. The enemy designs are significantly more interesting, but there's only a handful of them to go around. You seem to fight the same slimes, skeletons, and sprites on pretty much every continent of the game. It's so bad the game doesn't even bother with including a bestiary outside of the optional bounty monsters. The world map is peppered with little mini-dungeons to explore, but they're all procedurally generated and most lack anything interesting to see or do. The voice acting, while generally good, is far to infrequent. It cuts in and out at the strangest times, with most conversations generally only punctuated by grunts, exclamations, and various anime noises. There's only five or so towns to explore, about the same amount of dungeons, and the game's final dungeon basically boils down to an empty courtyard with 4 copy paste minibosses you have to beat to unlock the final boss door. If you ignore the side content, the main story portion of any given chapter can be breezed through in about 2 hours or so. Whether it was the budget or the schedule, something went wrong during the development of this one that put a serious squeeze on the amount of content. What is here is definitely quality, but it's spread way too thin.If this game is so lacking in content, why do many of the positive reviews have over 100 hours logged? Simple, the kingdom management mode. Similar to a F2P cell phone game, this mode runs on timers, as you will frequently need to pass time in order to accumulate enough of the mode's special currency to do anything, or to research new innovations and bonuses. Also similar to a phone game this mode can be fairly addictive. It also provides you incentive to go faff about doing sidequests and skirmish battles, as those will often provide rewards that bolster this mode further. When all is said and done however, this mode pretty much just exists to provide a few minor bonuses and quality of life improvements for your party, along with the game's crafting functions. I suspect many players leave the game open in the background to run down the timers while doing other things, which might account for the long playtimes. I stopped just short of the final kingdom upgrade, did most of the sidequests, and feel comfortable I've seen most of this game's actual content in under sixty hours. Overall I enjoyed this game. The combat is fun, and kingdom building is addictive even if the rewards are pretty underwhelming. I just with there had been a better story to carry this one through and that there was more prime content to enjoy.;Recommended;56.2;27/09/2021;102;N/I

Bandai Namco Entertainment;Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom;Adventure, RPG;R$ 257,90;Whether you like Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom comes from how you approach it.  If you come in expecting more of Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, you'll be disappointed as very little aside from some art styles and a few parts of the world are the same.  If you approach it as its own game with tenuous ties to the original, you may enjoy it better.This is a full action RPG rather than the hybrid turn based active battle system that the first game did.  You have AI controlled characters, and this time the AI uses them pretty effectively.  You have MP, but it is pretty limited and you will need to do melee attacks to regenerate your MP.  Your weapon skills can be pretty strong, but you can only use them once, maybe twice in trash fights and sparingly in bosses.  Magic is sadly weaker than in the first game due to the MP system.  You also have access to a dodge roll, and positioning is quite important.  The golden glim returns, this time it lets you do more damage and have infinite MP for a time.  It's quite amazing with Tani and her arrow rain skill, or Evan and some of his late game potent spells.Characterization is OK, a few characters have a lot of development but others are just kind of there.  The overall story isn't quite as good as the first game, and unlike the very threatening present of Shadar in NnK1, the villain here is not as visible.  While I wasn't fond of Drippy from NnK1, he at least has a personality. your fairy companion Lofty has barely any characterization.Artwise it's a mixed bag.  The character art and cutscenes are the same gorgeous Ghibli inspired fare you expect.  The terrain is more realistic, which doesn't mesh well with the character art.  Finally, the world map and the skirmishes use plastic toy like chibi characters which are just not my style.Animations, with one glaring exception, are also great.  The characters have great motion and feel.  The exception is that when you jump or dodge roll as Tani, you get a flash of her panties.  Tani can't be more than 12, just why did you think this was OK, especially with Ghibli doing the art and animation?Environments and level design are also mixed.  Some areas look great, and main story dungeons are also great and complex.  Optional areas however do not have a lot of variety.  You'll see a lot of the same reused rooms, corridors, and caves.  It can also be hard to find some of the areas on the world map, they're not always well distinguished from the decorations.The rest of the game is mixed too, there seems to be so many competing factors and aspects.  The main action RPG segment is great.  There's a large town building aspect which I find quite good.  Next, there is a skirmish mass combat aspect, with its own separate exp system.  Some optional dungeons are randomized.  Finally there's a crafting system.  Like NnK1, there's a creature collection system but it works differently.The town building is one aspect I quite love.  You obtain citizens for your kingdom via the story or by doing sidequests, and these citizens can be put to work at buildings in your kingdom.  They can collect crafting resources, perform research that unlocks more crafting options or give you permanent boosts, and gradually level up over time.  There are a large number of buildings, and upgrading and staffing the right ones can give you a number of rare crafting ingredients for crafting, creating higgledies, upgrading spells, or doing sidequests.  It's quite fun to manage, and you have easy teleport access to the city so it's easy to pop in, do some upgrades and start some research, then go back to progressing sidequests or the main story.  Do not neglect the city building aspect is there will be required upgrades you have to do!The skirmishes are mass combat, where you control up to 4 units that can rotate around you.  Three of them, hammer, spear, and sword are in a wheel where one beats another while is beaten by the third.  Then there's archery/spells that have no strength or weakness.  You will eventually earn more units, each with their own passive abilities and active skills.  Generally though, active skills aren't worth the expense and you're usually better off just using the military power resource to restore your units power as they're beaten down.  Skirmishes have their own experience and level system, totally separate from your character levels.  It can be difficult, especially early, as there aren't many ways to level up to have a chance.  The good thing is that even if you lose a skirmish (and the game over screen pops up), you actually don't lose anything (unless you spent kingdom currency on bolstering) and keep whatever xp is earned!  You can just slowly beat yourself against a difficult skirmish and you'll eventually get enough xp and power to win.  I didn't enjoy the skirmishes much, but it's something you will have to power through.  Do not neglect skirmishes as there are required ones during the story!Crafting is better than NNK1, but still not enjoyable.  There are a number of crafting options that aren't really connected to one another (except all being unlocked through your city building aspect of the game), so it can feel a bit disjointed.  Some of the top end gear requires grinding a lot of ingredients from an end-game randomized dungeon, adding a lot of false longevity (both the grind and the horrible randomness).As for weapons, you'll find most of the weapons and you'll generally only craft when you're drowning in high end materials.  Each character can equip 3 melee weapons and one ranged weapon, and there are three types of weapons (swords, axes/hammers, and spears).  Two characters can equip each type of weapon, so it's a good idea to only have one wielder in your party so you don't have two characters competing for the same one.  Unlike NnK1, you CAN swap Evan out of the party, and it may be a good idea to do so until he gets stronger as he levels up (and swapped out characters gain XP just fine).  Evan gets very high stats later on, but in the early to even mid game he's on the weak side.The creature collection this time are higgledies, these are up to 4 little minions that appear in battle with you,   They'll do some minor attacks or skills (like minor healing) and occasionally show a circle.  If you enter the circle and activate it, they'll use their active skill.  These can range from a healing field (useful), to spawning a cannon, to dropping a hammer with a decent chance to interrupt, summoning a knight to fight with you, or doing a high damage gravity field (very useful and you get access to a higgledy with this early!).  These can be leveled up with crafting too.Overall I did enjoy it, it's not quite as good of a story as Wrath of the White Witch, but it's a decent game set in the same universe.  I do wish it was more focused, I think it just tried to do too much.  Just the action RPG and the city builder, or just the action RPG and the skirmishes would have been a lot better.  With the resources spread out so much, I feel that too many aspects weren't explored enough.  Worth it on sale if you like jRPG's, just don't expect more of NnK1.;Recommended;135.2;21/07/2022;99;4
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom;Adventure, RPG;R$ 257,90;If you are just playing for the story, feel free to get the game but I would not advice you to purchase the DLC especially if you are not the grinder-type. Only get the DLC if you are the type who love to grind-a-lot in puzzling mazes and enjoy ultra-hard challenges. If you are just curious and want to know about the stories from the DLC, then I would recommend you to just seek for the play-through video from the streamers.  The game is fine, but not to the point that it really capture my heart entirely nor leaving any highlight impression. It just goes on without gripping me in the slightest. To be even more specifically honest, it is pretty bland.If there is one thing that I can highlight for this game, which leave a tiny-bit of impression, then it would be the town building and recruitment aspect. I personally feel that was pretty creative.The art style, of course - it is awesome. In fact, the art style of this game is what got me first to purchase this game. I won't said the soundtracks are especially ear-catching but it is durable.Overall, the game is... not great, not mediocre, but just good. I had try my very best to go for the DLC too after I finished the main stories but I just can't. The extreme-grinding is really not good for my health. Thanks for the game 🙏TL.

Bandai Namco Entertainment;Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom;Adventure, RPG;R$ 257,90;everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, luli have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.EDIT: 1080p :)oh, and it's fun too, right.Edit 2- Actual reviewGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.As for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a "main quest line only" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. There are several elements to the gameplay. One, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. Two, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.Three, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.Four, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.Overall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.Highly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.;Recommended;159.3;23/03/2018;135;6
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;Tales of Berseria is one of my favourite games and a prime example of how story structure and character development should be. If you've played Tales of Zestiria, Berseria fixes a lot wrong with Zestiria's story and let's you understand the recurring characters and their backstories. Story As I mentioned above, the story fills in a lot of gaps and does a better explanation of how the world works. Berseria takes place 1000 years before Zestiria does. The story kind of starts off a little slow, there is a known curse that happens, protagonist loses someone close they care about and that causes events to unfold. The story after that is mostly about the main character - Velvet - coming to terms with herself, getting her emotions back and caring about others again instead of being purely hate and rage filled on a blind suicide mission. Character development in this game is very strong and actually gets rather depressing at times, but it is done very well and has become one of my favourite games and stories. The game also takes a different spin as you're not playing as the hero, you're playing as the villains, who become the heros briefly due to a bigger threat, but in doing so, you singlehandedly keep the curse upon the world and further delve it into chaos. Everything that happens after this game (all the way to Zestiria) is simply because of Velvet and her party. - Artorius starts out as someone just trying to keep his family and village safe from the Hellions, albeit through some rather extreme measures, who eventually turns into someone who wants to rid the world of emotion so no more Hellions can spawn and gets a god complex in thinking he's the only one that can be the people's hope and even attempts to control a god.- Velvet starts out as a laid back girl just looking out for her sick brother, after his death who she blames Artorius for, she becomes consumed by hate and revenge and will willingly sacrifice herself if it means Artorius's death. As time goes on she begins to get her emotions back and begins to care about others again, coming to terms with what happened and coming to terms with herself, while still keeping the goal she made.- Eizen starts as just the sarcastic know it all, who pretty much retains that, but also begins showing more character as someone that wants to protect and help others. He's looking for his pirate crew's captain even after suspicion of his death, just so there is closure. Mentions multiple times he's trying to stay away from his sister because he knows he'll turn into a dragon and will cause harm to her, which he goes out of his way to enlist help from others to keep her safe and even helps another character, Zaveid come to terms with his denial over a loved one.- Zavied starts as a very cocky and plays a lot with the more carefree personality and not taking much serious. Zavied is very against killing, which eventually comes to light because his lover had turned into a dragon from malevolence corruption and he's in denial that she can't be reverted, thinking that everyone can be saved. Eizen is the one that shows him this is false and he needs to accept the fact that sometimes saving someone is killing them. They fight against Zavied's lover and Zavied comes to her defense multiple times, where he finally sees that she's gone and never coming back. Eizen has the chance to kill her and take her heart to reverse his own curse, but instead doesn't, in order to set her free in death, which Zavied makes a promise that he'll return the favour once Eizen turns and that he'll protect Eizen's sister. This is extreme foreshadowing and actually changes Zavied's outlook in Zestiria. There is much more character development from others, but I don't want to spoil everything.Graphics The graphics for the most part are pretty good. There is some slight AA issues on higher resolutions sometimes and some background environments may look a little plain, but the effects of moves, cutscenes be it the animated style or the actual game cutscenes are very nice. There are some gorgeous overworld areas as well with enough life given to them, just some dungeons and caves look a little too plain.Soundtrack This is one where I'll say Zestiria beats out Berseria. Berseria by no means has a bad soundtrack, it has a great soundtrack, but it didn't match the feel I got from Zestiria's OST. With that said, music for Berseria that is done by the Tales of Orchestra is very strong and eclipses past Zestiria in my opinion.Gameplay Gameplay is very fast paced in combat, which I like. The fast paced, combo/button spam free fight fits this game's narrative and pacing way better than turn based. Movement within the overworld is a little slow at first, but as you beat bosses and mini bosses, you'll get passive items that increase your speed. You'll be reading a lot of dialouge at times, through skits, chatter whilst moving around and cutscenes, which may get annoying for some, but something I personally didn't mind. Grinding levels in this game isn't that bad, most characters have some sort of "spammy" attack that should get you through if you pay attention to enemy weaknesses. Post game is an okay size, you have the Zavied and Dragon arch, an EX Dungeon and I think a few little side quests here and there.ConsThere isn't really much I can think of, as they're really going to be based on a person's preference. I'll name a few and the bolded one is an actual con. - Combos are very easy and honestly, there is plenty of moves that you can just spam over and over again no problem to just speed through enemies. - Long story that some might be turned away from. You will probably sink about 40 hours into the main game and maybe close to 60 if you do post game. This is "exacerbated" by a lot of dialog and skits that pop up. - PlayStation controller is not supported under normal circumstances. A few of my friends who played this with a PS controller, had issues. They had to use an external program to get it to work, which it did, however. it kept the button layout on screen as an Xbox controller instead of reflecting the PS layout. Summary - Fantastic story that that has amazing character development and gets depressing by putting moral questions within yourself trying to determine if Artorius is correct or if Velvet is correct.- Sound track that for the most part is very good and has plenty of memorable scores, but does fall a little short to Zestiria.- Fast combat gameplay that fits the pace of the game and keeps things moving.- Plenty of dialog if you're interested learning about the characters and the world.- A very good amount of gameplay to be had through enemies, exploration, bosses and post game. - Velvet is best character, like ever. Conclusion Tales of Berseria is seriously a game people need to try out. I won't make the argument that it's the best Tales game, as others have their own preferences, but it's my favourite Tales and one of my favourite games in general. The story is the main driving force for this game and everything else with it is just an added bonus to me. Legit, they could have turned this into an anime or even a movie and I would have been more than happy, but getting to play alongside it was fantastic. As I mentioned at the top, if you played Zestiria and was underwhelmed or felt like it was an uphill battle or had too many inconsistencies and/or poor explication, give Berseria a try. It seriously fixes so much that Zestiria did wrong and really puts the story for this universe together. It also sets up the plot for a third story, which I hope they go back to explore eventually since Tales of Arise is confirmed not to be apart of this universe. If this is your first Tales game or consideration, I can not recommend this game more than I already have.10/10 game!;Recommended;161.1;14/08/2019;1,118;39

Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;I wanted to wait until I beat it to write a review but at 60 hours in, the game is already so good I feel compelled to.This is probably one of the best action JRPGs you will find on PC, and certainly the height of the Tales series (disclaimer: I've played a handful, but not nearly all of them). Let's dive right into what makes Berseria great, and where it's a bit lacking:- The story is engrossing. Yes, it's JRPG, and it's Tales, so there's bound to be clichés and tropes, but Berseria strikes the perfect balance of not taking itself too seriously while presenting you with relatable characters in genuinely compelling scenarios. You can have fun, but still feel invested, and there's enough sub-plots to keep you interested in ALL of the main cast.- The combat is bleeding edge, joyous, chaotic mayhem. It's super fast paced, and between juggling enemy types to trigger status effects to fill your Soul Gauge to use Break Souls to feed your Mystic Artes (which you'll want to properly time to get grade bonuses, among other things), there is always a strategy to be refined on the battlefield if you are a grinder, min-maxer, or whatever. That isn't to say mastering the mechanics is a necessity. There are plenty of tools and difficulty settings to tweak the combat difficulty to your liking. Me? I crank that **** up to Intense ASAP and get to work melting wave after wave of demons in Dangerous Encounters (and all the better if you get a Dire Foe afterwards - seriously, these are some of the best, most heated moments of the game!).- The cast is fantastic and the writing is strong. This is hands down the biggest strength for me. Despite being yet another title in a genre as saturated as JRPG (in a series as dense as Tales, no less), the main characters manage to have very distinct personalities and motivations, and are just the right amount of "morally grey" to be likable without being obnoxious. They start off as somewhat standoffish misfits, cooperating only to pursue their personal opportunistic goals, but over time you will see them grow together in a way that is believable. There's also something deeply satisfying about being able to play as a team of blatant criminals, as opposed to the white knights, royalty, and chosen ones we've grown so tired of. And beyond that, even the side cast of characters does a great job of complementing and bouncing off of the main cast. The villains do seem a bit one dimensional, and I fear the "big bad" twist is going to end up being predictable, but it's a small bump on an otherwise fantastic journey. Final note on this - the themes and the tones are appropriately adult. The language feels natural and there is swearing and innuendo in all the right places, never beating you over the head with it.- The pacing is good. The intro/tutorial segment is the perfect length (some Tales games have ones that drag on ENTIRELY too long, not the case here), and you will periodically unlock new mechanics to keep the gameplay fresh. You will actually acquire all the party members pretty early on in the game, although this is preferable due to how the equipment mastery system works.- Great customization options. The arte pools are huge, and the trees are fully customizable. I've used Velvet almost exclusively for the first 60 hours, but I can tell there is still plenty to unlock for her and the rest of the cast seems to have their own fun, unique playstyles as well. Because of how fast paced the combat is, I don't find myself switching primary fighters as much as previous Tales games, but Berseria actually makes it even easier by allowing you to swap mid-battle, mid-combo. Lots of fashion options, lots of equipment flavors, and a mastery system that makes it fairly compelling to keep different sets of equipment around (and tweak until your playstyle is content).- The world map is expansive, but the areas can be a bit samey, and the puzzles are definitely nothing groundbreaking. Pretty middle of the road for JRPG, so just don't expect anything impressive there. I find myself constantly looking back to Symphonia as the holy grail of Tales world maps, as I've yet to see that one be outdone.- The voice acting is good. I've only listened to the dub, as the English VAs are more than serviceable. The main cast are all great. The NPCs are not as varied as I'd like or as I have seen in previous Tales games, but again a pretty small nitpick. Nearly all cutscenes and skits are fully voiced, though, so there is a truly dense amount of lore and worldbuilding going on, if you are into it (I am).- The visuals are aesthetically pleasing. Watch some videos. It should be clear that Berseria is not pushing next gen graphic fidelity. Instead it goes for a colorful, eye-popping art style that does the game justice.- The music is good. The tracks set the appropriate moods, and have enough depth to be enjoyable from moment to moment, but I honestly didn't find much in the way of "holy **** I need to go download this right NOW" kind of songs. Still, I would say a bit above average in terms of video game music.In summary, this is a must-buy for Tales fans, but still a heavily encouraged purchase for JRPG fans, action RPG fans, or someone looking to try out the genre. If you haven't tried the series before, don't worry about needing to start at the beginning. You can jump right into this without any issues and you'll find yourself getting giddy with glee as you literally hack through swaths of demons like they were hot butter in no time: I guarantee it.;Recommended;113.0;23/06/2017;317;9
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;This review is for those who are considering buying the game but are unfamiliar to the franchise. As my first experience of a Tales game, I was so enthralled by the franchise that I bought every single Tales game I could get my hands on after I completed this. I seriously enjoyed Tales of Berseria. If you like JRPG's and you also like action games: buy this. It has its flaws, yes, but it's an enjoyable experience despite them. The game does well with character interaction through the use of skits: these are optional story segments that you unlock as you complete the main quest or explore the areas that allows the player to see into the motivations and personality of each character. The tone of these skits vary from serious and philosophic, to cringey and goofy. But they are delightful to interact with and for that reason, I don't have a favourite character. They're all my favourite. The combat is fairly novel and takes a bit to get used to. You can switch characters as you like (although I mostly stuck to Velvet) and they each have their own skills sets and abilities. You can learn passive skills through wearing certain items and collecting experience through combat (kind of like Final Fantasy IX) - I've always liked this system as it encourages you to wear and collect as many different items as possible, not just the ones with the most armor or magic, etc. The upgrade system is good, but getting the ingredients can be a grind and you won't need to upgrade your equipment to the maximum possible level to complete the game.Oh and the card mini game is pretty fun and you get cool rewards. Speaking of, the customisation is very cute and you can unlock quite a few options as you progress through the game. I would suggest playing the game in Japanese and reading subtitles if you are an English user (although sometimes you might miss a few things in battle). But each to their own.;Recommended;103.8;30/10/2020;117;4
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;Berseria is a great game but with many flaws you must be aware of before buying and playing, but these are minor enough to not stain it's greatness too much. A great buy and a good step forward from Zestiria.Be aware that the Tales of series (after Eternia) due to their constant lore exposition is better enjoyed when taken as a hybrid between shonen anime and video game.Playtime: Very long (50-80hrs depending on your speed, difficulty and completion, without doing any postgame content)Chosen playthrough difficulty: Hard.Compared to other Tales of titles, i'd say it's among the best in my eyes, along with Symphonia and Abyss.+Enormous world with tons of lore+Great character design (for a shonen-type story that is)+If you like combos BUY IT INSTANTLY DON'T EVEN USE YOUR BRAIN+Tons of complex mechanics making it really enjoyable if you take them all seriously enough+Multiple playable characters with radically different playstyles you can swap with during combat, never boring+It sits comfortably between a game and an anime, oscillating between combat-heavy dungeon parts and more laid-back narrative inbetweens that let you breathe while developing it's characters and story (which you can skip if you don't appreciate exposition and want to get straight to gameplay)+Very long playtime. You're in for quite an adventure!+Magilou+Post-Scarlet Night Velvet is basically a female Guts, and anything that goes the Berserk way is always good+If you like putting silly cosmetics on your characters and losing yourself to hilarity when Velvet gets serious while wearing a mustache and a giant Normin suit this game is for you+Tons of collectibles+Extremely deep customization (equipment, forging, arte loadout, titles, ...)-Lots and lots of empty hallways, lots and lots of walking around and backtracking.-Bad balancing (My opinion on that only counts for hard difficulty!), casters (npc's & pc's) are extremely overpowered, to the point where battles against a horde of caster mobs can be harder than most bosses, and slow melee bosses can be killed with kiting while using casters as CPUs and running in circles). Mob casting times are too short (especially for casting bosses. Isn't it, Kamoana?), and mob hitstun duration is inconsistent (bosses and some enemies have resistance, and the hitstun you inflict when you have used up all of your sp is shorter) making them frequently insta-punish you by one-shotting you in the middle of your combo.-Some performance issues that can either be fixed by tweaking gfx settings or grabbing a patch.-Sometimes not just difficult but outright unfair, you will need patience to really enjoy ToB.-Due to the story, some characters will disappear and reappear from your party, scrambling your combat team without warning. You might get mad if Rokurou swaps with one of your main casters right before a very difficult boss, so be mindful of this!Despite it's flaws ToB gets a warm recommendation from me, as these can generally be dealt with, are case-specific or opinion-based. Go get it, especially if it's on sale!;Recommended;73.6;4/12/2017;133;7
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;If this is your first Tales or you're a returning player like me, just get it. I got burnt by Zestiria, but the story is so mature and well written in this one. It's kinda connected to Zestiria and made me want to go back and play that.The characters in this really feel like they are all here for their own reasons, which helps with the whole 'you are the enemy' feeling. Most of them don't want to do anything to help people, their own greed or glory being their motivation.Combat is pretty solid too. Got through most of the game doing the auto-combo on a and focusing on dodging things. Decided to make my own stun combos later and dedicated combos to certain types of enemies that really annoyed me.The story in this alone is worth it. It's heavy on the text but I found myself reading every little optional thing, caring about why everyone was here and why things were they way they were. All the little nods to Zestiria are nice too and adds to the awesome factor.It took me about 80 hours to finish. I took my sweet time taking everything and my only regret is that I waited for a sale instead of buying this outright day 1. A deep, dark story and an amazing combat system that can hold your hand through the game if you choose helps make it so much more accessible.;Recommended;111.0;26/05/2018;110;2
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;So after about 70 hours i finished the story of Tales of Berseria. I did not download any item packs and played on normal difficulty. I´ll just jump right into the review.GraphicsIt fullfills its purpose. It is not espeacially good or bad. The characters are well designed and the animated scenes are beautiful. But tbh, i don´t really care about the graphic quality in this game.SoundFirst of all the soundtrack is amazing. No other than Motoi Sakuraba composed the soundtrack. It really has a big role in the atmosphere of the game. This is what i call art. Every scene is accompanied by a track, that fits perfectly. Joy, happiness or sadness, even the funny parts feel authentic.Now the dub. Everything in this game is dubbed. The dubbing actors did an amazingly good job. I have no reason to play the Newgame+ with japanese dub. The english dub is by far better than expected and i´ll stick to that. BUT this game has a bug. Many people cannot hear certain sounds when using 5.1 surround sound. In this case you also cannot hear the dub. Using the stereo mode fixes this problem, but can cause other sound issues. I recommend using a fix for that (just google it and you will find it).GameplayThe battle system is in realtime and pretty good, but not well explained. You have to figure out some stuff on your own. Tbh, i liked figuring stuff out, but i can see people being annoyed, because certain actions/skills don´t work they way they expected it. The items and ability system is easy to understand and the game is beatable without focussing too much on optimization. If you want to master every equipment or make very effective combos in battles it becomes a little bit more complex.Outside from fights in dungeons you have to walk a bit until you unlock certain teleportation points. Outside from dungeons there is a quick travel system that is bound to a consumeable item. Since you should have absolutely no money problems, it is no problem to buy nearly endless of this stuff.At a certain point ingame i nearly stopped caring about anything that has to do with gameplay, because the story gets such a strong peak, you could have given me 2d jump´n´run gameplay and i would have enjoyed this game.AtmosphereNow some of the more important parts. The atmosphere in this game is convincing. I felt like i was part of the world ingame. This is achieved by the amazing soundtrack and also by many other little things. For example small conversations between characters (which are also dubbed) or even some background noises.The characters all have their motivations to do whatever they do and no one feels out of place. There are many scenes where i thought: "Oh god no, why did you say that?" The first time was the point where my mindset changed. These characters HAVE a personality. Each of them. And the game is not afraid of showing this.The characters develop while progressing in game. Everything happens for a reason. To fully understand what happened with some characters i had to rewatch scenes or let whatever happened rewind in my head. I paused the game many times, just being stunned, waiting for my brain to comprehend the situation.StoryWow, what can i say about the story. I don´t know, i am speechless. The story in itself is kind of sinister and gets darker, especially when you understand why certain things happend. While the game starts a bit slow it quickly gets to a point where i stopped thinking this is a game. I stopped "playing" it and started "experiencing" it. My emotional state was decided by the happenings in game. I felt joy, i laughed, i was angry, i even cried a few times. This story hits you hard with emotions. And this is coming from a guy who stopped playing story focused game long ago and thought he was more of a cold, emotionless guy.tl.dr: All i can say is i am absolutely overwhelmed by this masterpiece. Don´t get scared away if you think the beginning is slow or boring. If you are only interested a little bit in JRPGs or just want want to experience a great stroy, because most of the animes released nowadays are boring, i definetly recommend this game. I also recommend watching the trailer "The Calamity and The Blade", which is english dubbed, since steam only has the "The Flame" trailer.This is the best game i have ever played.;Recommended;110.7;25/05/2017;139;2
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;Once every few years, a JRPG arrives that blends together good world-building, a story that is both fascinating and thought-provoking, challenging your own worldview, philosophy and beliefs and a combat system that, while simple at first, makes you feel like a glorious badass having fun killing hordes after hordes of enemies.This is Tales of Berseria. Review is spoiler-free, minus the intro stuff.The game puts you in the boots of Velvet - an average village girl that one day gets to see her little brother being murdered right in front of her by her own brother-in-law, she turns into a daemon and then she gets thrown in prison to feast on other daemons for 3 years. As she manages to escape with someone's help, she learns that her brother-in-law now is mankind's greatest hope against daemons, and the whole world praises him as a saviour. Filled with rage for the injustice she and her brother tasted, she embarks on a journey to kill him.Let me start off with the world-building. I was having a discussion with a few friends over how games stopped bothering with giving attention to details due to how gamers nowadays tend not to care much about information that gives you a clue on how X village works, how they survive in Y conditions etc. For that I'm glad that Berseria doesn't do that. Here, in the form of completely optional NPC's, you'll find stuff like a father looking for his lost son, a group of teenagers who become interested in music and decide to start their own band and dogs that are criticizing humanity. For that I praise the creators of the game who decided to not restrict themselves to "what information is useful" but also to "what information makes you immerse". I found myself returning to a city wondering whether a couple of NPC's got married. I can't criticize the English voice acting because I play the game in Japanese voice acting, and there's some great quality to be found there. One of the characters in the group, for example, is the same voice actor behind Jojo's bizarre adventure part 4 antagonist, Yoshikage Kira, and he's doing a glorious job here, too.Combat system time! People will bash the game for having "button-mashing combat". And they are right, combat is button mashy, BUT... It would be wrong to stop here. See, this is first and foremost a JRPG that has an "exploit weakness system". Your typical dungeon/area visit will be  to first identify the enemy population's weaknesses, compile combos that hit every weakness they have then mash that button against them. For example (oversimplified), if an area has worms, knights and bats I end up identifying and crafting 3 different combos so I'll mash Y for bats, X for knights and B for worms (Xbox controller). This is the equivalent of scrolling through menus in a turn-based JRPG to find the ice spell versus enemies that are weak to ice, the armor penetration move for armored enemies etc. Later in the game the enemy variety becomes large enough that not only you craft combos for each but you make sure you can weave them. So you'll start with X for the first move of the X-combo then Y because the second move of the Y-combo works not only for bats but for armored, etc. Then you get moves called mystic artes that make your characters go full blown crazy killing machines. All in silky smooth 60 frames per second, even for my poverty rig (there's a demo on Steam that you can check out if you're not sure about your PC's performance). Add to that the amazing A.I. behind your teammates, which is also one of the best, if not the best in a Tales game ever and can easily play better than 70% of the players! I can even put everyone on "auto" and go to the bathroom knowing that we will almost certainly win a fight.Now for the downsides: So far, I find the game quite linear - on rails, so to speak, and the optional areas that I have unlocked so far (I haven't finished the game yet, have mercy) are simple arenas that lack in the difficulty and satisfaction department, compared to the rest of the content. I found myself visiting them once, go "is that it?" then leave in disappointment. Maybe this will change as the game goes on. I heard very good things about the post-game content. There are also the occasional sidequests and mini games that (thankfully) are so many and diverse that you can "play favorites" without losing the rewards (you win coins that let you buy stuff, but its shared across mini-games, thanks Namco).The difficulty settings are Simple - Normal - Moderate - Hard, with Intense and Chaos being unlocked after you do something in the game. On the other hand, there's a way to make fights so hard you'll almost always get a couple of party members or everyone dead. To give you a clue, my winrate in normal fights is around 90% but for dangerous fights it's at 10%, but that's just me not accepting winning a fight with people being knocked out left and right (the game rewards you with in-game score, called Grade, if you win fights without deaths and without using items, who would say no to that?!?). Maybe it's also me being used to JRPG's throughout the years. Someone can also play the game with the combat system in full automatic mode - AI doing everything - in case you just want to experience the story without bothering with learning how the combat works (I wouldn't do that but some people could). NINJA EDIT: Something else that I noticed and I gotta say: Contrary to most JRPG's, on higher difficulties the enemies not only get the usual stat increases but also different attack frequency and in bosses it can be a change of movesets and spells!Overall, this isn't simply one of the top Tales games ever (and easily the best modern Tales game - RIP Zestiria) but a great JRPG. I said it on my Zestiria review and I'll say it again: "Tales of" games are the only JRPG series on Steam that combines fast-paced flashy combat system with immersive storytelling. Does it worth paying full price? For me that's a resounding yes. But I hope that my review was informative enough to draw your own decision. Meanwhile, I'll be finishing my playthrough and prepare for my next one. And if you choose to get into it, I would advise you to take it slow and savor every minute, instead of speed through it. JRPG's like this one deserve to be enjoyed like good wine or chocolate.;Recommended;200.1;10/02/2017;169;7
Bandai Namco Entertainment;Tales of Berseria;Action, RPG;R$ 175,01;Quick review : -  You like JRPG?  You can buy. Trust me. You'll love it.-  You don't like JRPG?  Return to the steam frontpage and search another game, cause this is a pur JRPG-  You wonder if you should buy this one over another game?  Here is a detailled review to help you in your choice : Detailled review (pretty long, and from a non-english native, be prepared!) :  Story The world is filled with bad guys, demons, corrupted nobles and wars everywhere. But one man stand against that. And he's ready to everything to stop this madness and bring peace to the world.How Classic.But that's not the story we are going to play. We are going to see what happened  after . And not with good guys, but with a team of people who don't give a f*ck about what's good and bad and only care about their own desires.Just for this, the game is worth it : You're not following people who fight for the "good". And this create a lot of interesting situations you will not see in any other game.Add to this a team of characters with strong personalities (and especially different goals for everyone) and you get really fun cutscenes where no one agree on anything. Talking of cutscene, there are a  lot . Always, and for all kind of subject, most notably on non-important stuff, which help seeing our characters in their every-day life, their are not just puppet meant to reach the end of game.Add this to a 70-80 hours of main story, and you've got a tale you will remenber for years. Gameplay Like most JRPG, gameplay goes into two parts : Exploration and battle.Not much to say on exploration : you travel through towns and dungeons, gathering stuff, getting informations from NPC.. classic stuff. And there are a few mini games here and there.As for battle, this is also a big point to the game : you control one character with 3 others helping you. You move freely trought the arena, dodging ennemy's attack and looking for the best opportunity to strike back. Or you can go head-on and pray the ennemies dies before you, works too. You can choose the comportment of your teammates too, will they attack the same ennemy as you? The weak one? Stay back and use magic? it's up to you to tell them.This game also has a interesting system of weakness : each ennemy is weak to one or several element (fire, water, wind, earth) and has a type (beast, snake, undead, human...). Each of your attack is gonna hit one of those weakness/type, and the more you can hit in a combo, the more the damage can go up. This force you to adapt your combo to each new ennemy, preventing the game to become stale. Which is quite needed considering how long this game is.Or you can just switch the character you play with. The black-haired scary-women you've seen in the trailer at the top of this page is not the only one you can use, and they are all fun to play with !Still reading? Thank you so much ! You must really have an interest in Tales of Bereseria then ! Story and battle gameplay are the two selling point of this game. For graphism and music, well, they are good and suit the game, we can't really ask much more for them to be considered good.I didn't go into the detail of how deep the battle system can be, and only scratch the basis of the story, not even talking about the characters, because discovering it plays a big role in how great this game is.In the end, I greatly recommand this game, he's awesome. Heck, I wouldn't have written such a big review if it wasn't the case! Magikazam ! You can now buy the game and learn the meaning of that last word, or stay the rest of your life in ignorance, the end justifies the means .);Recommended;103.0;10/11/2017;129;10

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;RPG;R$ 129,99;Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. "Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older". And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home...."Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?" And lets not talk about the characters.

CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;RPG;R$ 199,90;Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been "playable" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the "next gen" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.;Recommended;145.0;16/02/2022;5,241;86

CD Projekt Red;Cyberpunk 2077;RPG;R$ 199,90;I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 2 years later... I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch. I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 1 day later...I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. "It looks decent and actually pretty fun now," I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.2 days later...I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam. just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. Present day... This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!Some thoughts:This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. P.S.Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.;Recommended;73.0;28/09/2022;616;10

CD Projekt Red;Gwent: The Witcher Card Game;RPG, Strategy, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;Gwent is a card game but you can't compare it with any other cardgame out there, like Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra or Magic. It's very unique in gameplay and has almost nothing in commen with the Witcher 3 Gwent you can play with the ingame NPCs.If you play Gwent, it feels very tactical and not luck based at all compared to the others. I am a big fan of card games and I played almost every game of this genre. Nothing kept me playing it like Gwent does, even after years. This game is very well made. The grafics and the animated cards espcally, but even the gameplay is very balanced und fluid. If you already played few online card games, you probably know you have to pay alot of money to get good decks, but not here. In Gwent you can easly craft your first few good decks after couple of weeks playing, without ripping of your whole wallet.I already loved playing Gwent with the Witcher 3 NPCs, even tho this version was very crappy. CD Project Red took this idea out of the game and made a whole new standalone version. I played it since release in March 2017, and since then they made a ton of changes and reworked the whole game multiple times. I never expirienced a developer who put so much love and work into a online card game after release and I am a bit sad that this Game is so unbelievable underrated. This is the only game i feel like I could play it until the last day of my life. I hope it's community keeps growing and the devs keep it alive <3//I already got 448 hours ingame time on GOG Galaxy, I just recently started playing it on steam;Recommended;174.8;15/01/2022;203;5

CD Projekt Red;Gwent: The Witcher Card Game;RPG, Strategy, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;Whew, here we go, I will subdivide in topics because it will be a long ride: I have +2200 hours of Gwent on GOG and over 300 confirmed kills (?).I play Gwent since the open beta and I consider myself a "semi professional" player (I play tournaments and Pro Rank since forever and doing top 500 lately, maybe 200 if I push hard)Important disclaimer to start:This game is not the Gwent of Witcher 3, its massively more deep and complex, and better of course. Only thing they have in common is you play for points and best of 3 rounds.Skill, Consistency and Less RNG:Gwent is objectively the card game in which the RNG matters less, and arguably, skill matters most. It is all about CONSISTENCY.Why is this? Not only because cards themselves have effects that are not random in their majority, but because of how deck sizes and draws work:- Your deck has 25 Cards- You draw 10 at the beginning of the game, with 2 or 3 mulligans.- On round 2, you draw 3 more, and have 2 more mulligans- On Round 3, you draw 3 more, and have 2 more mulligans.So, I won't do all the math but as you can see, you have a very high chance of getting the cards you want or at least the ones you need to execute your gameplay. This is a HUGE difference from other card games in which your deck is huge and you are drawing 1 by 1 hoping to get what you want (thus, rng of the draw affecting a lot more because of this)The other thing about the skill intensiveness Gwent has, is that there is no mana, so you can play ANY card at ANY given turn. This opens you to A LOT of possibilities, which makes the game harder to master IMO and a lot more harder to analyze and play correctly or optimally.This is amazing if you are looking to smash your brain into the game and feel excited about playing WELL and winning by 1 point (that happens A LOT), BUT, can be a bit overwhelming also, making it a game that doesn't shine THAT much on casual play and that can get you brain-tired easier than other games in which you are just stomping the mana curve at the beginning.SettingThe art and the universe, well, it's the Witcher, if you like dark stuff you will love it, if you want some funny and light hearted stuff, you won't like it. I find it very appealing personally, but sometimes its too dark and can drag you down a little bit. Anyway it's awesome for the most part, and also very mature.Generosity (NO P2W)Gwent is the most generous digital card game ever. Period. You can analyze the numbers and you will see it.Even LoR being generous, Gwent just goes over the top with it. You will have a Tier 1 deck in no time playing this game without paying, I can guarantee it.DevelopmentWell this is the roughest spot of Gwent. While CDPR is a great company that made great games, for Gwent it is lacking a bit. I mean, they hear the community for sure and deliver some balances here and there to fix things, but the patches are always messy (with bugs), some balance decisions are very questionable (but they later fix them), but for the most part, aside of some specific things, the game is always enjoyable and well balanced.Gwent as an EsportCompetitively speaking as an Esport, the circuit is nice, but can be improved. There are qualifiers every month in which the top 64 of the pro ladder compete for places on Gwent Open, an event in Poland that they pay your travel to and can win some nice money. Obviously reaching there is VERY HARD but it can be made, and grind is not the only thing that matters. Aside from this official circuit, there are plenty of tournaments organized by the community, in which sadly I would like CDPR to get involved more (so we can have money prizes) but that still doesn't happen. Anyway they are fun, the people is great, there are streaming coverage, and nice ingame prizes.CommunityCommunity is nice, aside from the same trolls as all games has on reddit and such, for tournaments all the big teams are very nice and open, there are many videos with information and stuff to help new players, and many of tournaments iniatives made by the community (on english and even on spanish too)ConclusionFor real, on Gwent, SKILL matters, and don't take it from the AD, take it from me that I've been playing now for 3 years competitively.Invite link to get thingieshttps://www.playgwent.com/invite-a-friend/VN7IQY9ABA;Recommended;439.1;19/05/2020;232;11

CD Projekt Red;Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales;Adventure, RPG;R$ 55,99;I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.Real decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.But instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.Some really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.Also some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.You also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). But piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.If there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.Some people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.The real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.So if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.It does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.However, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.Not sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.Maybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.Is it worth the cost?

CD Projekt Red;Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales;Adventure, RPG;R$ 55,99;I thoroughly enjoyed Thronebreaker, and give it a full 10/10. It's really quite brilliant.The writing is superb, and the voice acting really brings the story to life.As for Gwent, well, it's much improved over the original Witcher 3 version, and the battles in Thronebreaker are tailored to fit the story, with special cards and rules. I rarely got bored in the 55 hours it took me to finish.Make no mistake, this is another epic tale from the Witcher universe, and I highly recommend it.......but a couple of things worth knowing before you buy:1. Witchers feature very little in Thronebreaker. This is more a story of rulers and their armies.2. If you buy Thronebreaker on Steam, you can't unlock the perks in Gwent on GOG. You'll need to buy the GOG version to do that. (Edit: Gwent is now available on Steam);Recommended;59.0;19/05/2019;94;4

CD Projekt Red;Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales;Adventure, RPG;R$ 55,99;I went into this game completely blind, knowing nothing about it. At the time of writing this I have 10 hours of play time. 8 of those were from the day i got this game in one long session.  I will update this as I go further through the game, even though no one cares and no one will read this.I don't know how long this is going to be but just in case TLDR: The game is good. But not perfect. The story is fantastic, giving you the details of what happens outside of the stuff you play in the main Witcher games. The actions you choose throughout the game effect the gameplay and story. The effects of your decisions become apparent at a good enough pace to keep you interested. Even some of the most mundane decisions that you think wont have any effect, will change the game. The voicing is done very well and feels real and with emotion.The gameplay is split into two parts, traversing the map and the gwent. The map traversing is fun, the art style is beautiful and suits the game very well. When traveling the map you loot and fight random encounters. There are treasures to find and points of interest that can affect your gameplay and story. My one gripe with this part of the game is the slow movement speed, which is expensive to upgrade.Gwent is main part of this game. Don't like gwent, sucks to suck this game isn't for you. The gwent in this game is a dumbed down version of the Gwent in the Witcher 3 and the standalone Gwent game. You only have two rows of cards to play. Other than that the mechanics are similar if not the same. At the start of the game your freedom of deck style is limited but as you advance it expands. Your actions in the story will have an effect on your cards. Cards can be taken away or added depending on your decisions and how the game goes. The camp system is where you can buy upgrades, train new cards, configure your deck, do practice matches and talk to the people in your party.  Every system here works well and adds to the game. Conclusion: This game is really good. For me it has very few flaws, an intriguing fluid plot, and fun casual gameplay. This game requires patience if you want the best experience, and can be frustrating at times when you cant get past a battle or a puzzle. If you are a fan of the Witcher series, especially the story, this game is for you.Why the hell did I write this. No one will read this everyone knows the game is good. Oh well someone hire me as a reviewer despite my garbage writing skills.Update 1: 43 HoursSome of the battles and puzzles are disproportionately hard. I have been playing on the hardest difficulty throughout my playthrough. Due to my actions I've lost a lot of good characters. Taking the middle path between good and evil can sometimes be worse than being evil. Multiple times I have gotten furious at this game. I am writing this after a battle that took be almost 2 hours to beat. Upgrading your camp is way more important than I thought, and I hate myself for being so charitable throughout the game.Update 2: End of The GameI got one of the good endings. It was pretty cool. But I have another complaint about the game. WHERE THE HELL WAS GERALT. Yes I understand this game is about Meve and the Nilfguardian war. But it is still a Witcher game, and especially when Geralt is shown on the cover art of the game how are you gonna have him pop up for just one scene. It was cool to get some backstory about him, but I am a bit sad. I freaked out when he appeared, and cried when he disappeared. Awful game -120/10. Not enough Geralt. I would not play this game again in the near future. At some point it got a bit tedious.;Recommended;45.3;22/05/2020;60;12
CD Projekt Red;Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales;Adventure, RPG;R$ 55,99;CDPR did it again, they proved that it's not the budget that defines a good game, and that Geralt is not the reason why the Witcher universe is so successful and enjoyable to dive in. Thronebreaker is standalone single-player card game in the Witcher universe, where there are no good choices, only different shades of grey. It's definitely not as huge production as the Witcher 3, but for its price I can definitely say that CDPR didn't disappoint, it's probably the best single player card game I've ever played, with strong story, good design, a lot of puzzles to solve and synergy strategies to put in use. Nothing here feels forced, rushed or neglected, the game is very enjoyable at its core and I can recommend it for everybody who liked the gwent mini-game from Witcher 3, let alone fans of card games, since for them this is a mandatory position.I'm not a huge fan of card-based games myself, but I did enjoy the one in Witcher 3, and I enjoyed this one even more. Thronebreaker is a very solid position with a rich story, something that I didn't know was possible considering its card game genre, but CDPR once again proved that they don't accept anything else but a masterpiece in its perfection. I admire them for the work put into even the smallest details, something a lot of other game studios could learn from, as playing games like these is a pure pleasure for my mind.Good job CDPR!;Recommended;95.6;25/12/2018;82;2

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher Adventure Game;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 29,99;This is a good realization of the board game. It is playable as hot-seat or online and may give you many hours of enjoyable experience.But there are some flaws that need to be fixed to make the game perfect:1. When a player have to do a choice, he/she can't access to the game map and/or any player hero sheet and resources including his/her own. This may easily lead to wrong decisions and waste fun. The board game is obviously free from this limitation. So, the possibility to "minimize" the choice and take look at the game state will make the game much comfortable.2. Some choices are not clearly described. For example, Triss Merigold has a spell to look at the two top investigation cards then put one on the bottom of the deck and the other back on top. When this spell is used, the game show two cards and say to the player just "choose one of them". What will be happen next with the chosen card is unclear.3. The rules of the game says that proofs can't be exchanged back to leads. So, the investigation successes of a hero converted to proofs must me "protected" from any bad events that force the hero to spend leads. But in the computer version proofs ARE exchanged back to leads every time a hero must spend more leads than he/she have.4. The AI is wery weak, so the single-player games are dull and not enjoyable at all.5. There is no russian language, sadly to many and many russian-speaking Witcher fans.6. In network games, when a player quits at the characters selecting stage, all other players are forced to quit and try to start network game again. That allows one player to abuse many other.7. Triss "Teleport" spell is mightly overpowered. It allows Triss to collect two leads in a turn without any risk. I think, this is not the board game disbalance but the wrong implementation in computer game. Some other abilities with the text "when you perform [stated action] {do something in addition}" also work weird in the computer game.;Recommended;1,364.2;1/12/2014;199;4
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher Adventure Game;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 29,99;I would say 50% strategy, 50% luck. Which for a board game that's pretty good. + good music. + the AI is not faceroll easy, but also doesn't cheat+ I didn't feel like I didn't have control. You do feel like you have choices and that your choices matter. The game doesn't play itself for you.+ the ability to play against other real life people :)- would like the ability to skip AI's turns. The AI in comparrison to other games is quite quick, but if you're playing a 5 quest match with 3 AI opponents it drags out.Enjoying the game and would recommend it to anyone that likes board games :);Recommended;4.7;27/11/2014;255;7

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher Adventure Game;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 29,99;This recommendation is conditional.  If you were interested in getting the physical board game, as I was, I would definitely recommend this as it could save you $60 if you decide that it's not for you.  Another condition is to have friends you could play this with if you don't plan on getting the physical game.  If you do not meet either of these conditions, then this game gets a little hard to recommend at the moment.  The AI is fairly stupid which, for the first game or 2, is fine.  But after 1 game for me, I was able to face-roll the AI.  I think I won by almost 45 victory points.  It's always possible that the devs could improve the AI.  But as of right now, that's where other people would come in to play.  Ultimately, this game was fun enough to convinced me to buy the physical game, but I can't imagine playing too many more games against the AI.;Recommended;9.5;3/02/2015;64;3

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher Adventure Game;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 29,99;A game reminiscent of Mario Party with board game mechanics.A board game themed witcher game, which features characters from the witcher series in the game. Basically, it plays like a board game on the pc. If you ever played any of the Mario Party games, this game is similiar. Each player takes good or bad card hits on their turn and can move spaces or do certain actions on each turn. Note that it seems that negative cards usually are more in the game then positive cards, but that what makes it interesting, what you do with the negative effects and play a round with them. Anyways, here is my pro/con list as usual:PROs:`Featuring characters in the Witcher series`Board game mechanics`Interesting playing cards randomized to give good or bad fates`Quests that you need to do`Online Multiplayer`Local Co-op up to 4 playersCONs:`Repitition. Every turn, you do something, kill a monster (or fail), and then end turn. Every turn is similiar.`Getting killed by same monster every turn can happen to you, thus making you fail the gameMY final thoughts: If your a fan of the witcher series, i recommend it. Also, there is multiplayer online play. Other than that, this game can become repitive if you play it too much. Be careful of that.;Recommended;2.4;5/05/2017;54;5
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher Adventure Game;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 29,99;ITALIANOGioco a Witcher Adventure Game sin dalla beta, quando ancora era molto povero di contenuti, e mi divertiva molto sin da allora.Inizio spiegando brevemente (per coloro che non capissero bene l'inglese) cos'è il gioco. Witcher Adventure Game è un gioco da tavolo tratto dalla saga di The Witcher(c): esiste sia in versione cartacea che in versione digitale (esattamente questa). E' possibile giocarci contro il computer (selezionando quali pedine muovere o lasciare all'IA o togliere del tutto) o online contro giocatori umani, in lobby pubblica o in stanza privata.Si può giocare come Geralt, Triss, Yarpen e Dandelion, ognuno dei quali ha abilità, vantaggi e svantaggi diversi. Il gioco ruota intorno alle carte missione e i punti vittoria. All'inizio di ogni partita è possibile determinare quante di queste sarà necessario completare per vincere (1, 3 o 5), nonchè un tempo limite per ogni turno (che inizierà a decorrere se rimaniamo inattivi).Ogni carta missione ha 1 obiettivo principale (che una volta completato elimina la carta), 2 obiettivi secondari (che se completati danno extra PV) e un obiettivo di supporto che può completare un altro giocatore e ricompensa entrambi di PV. Si completano gli obiettivi accumulando "leads" e "proofs", dei simboli colorati ottenuti spostandoci di luogo nel tabellone o con le carte di investigazione (che vanno risolte appena utilizzate). L'esito di molte azioni e degli scontri è determinato dai dadi e dalle abilità del personaggio. Il gioco finisce quando uno dei giocatori completa l'ultima carta missione (non è necessario completare per forza gli obiettivi secondari) e vince il giocatore con il maggior numero di punti vittoria.I punti vittoria si possono acquisire in battaglia, con carte speciali, si possono altresì perdere nello stesso modo.La fortuna gioca un ruolo molto importante nel gioco, in quanto esistono carte malevole (che possono bloccare alcune abilità e rallentare il tuo gioco o quello di tutti), oltre a quelle benevole, ed è importante imparare a pianificare le mosse e utilizzare le abilità del personaggio per ottimizzare i propri turni e vincere.I difetti che ho riscontrato finora sono i seguenti:- Trovo che Yarpen sia un po' più lento e penalizzato rispetto agli altri personaggi, ma magari son solo io...- Una cosa che invece andrebbe indubbiamente migliorata è l'intelligenza artificiale nella modalità offline, il computer sembra prendere decisioni totalmente casuali e abusa il fast-travel quasi volesse bombardarsi (e bombardare il giocatore) di carte malevole come unica difficoltà.- Purtroppo il multiplayer è ancora poco popolato, spesso si finisce per giocare dei semplici duo, e a volte si trova la lobby vuota e si deve aspettare, ma se si riesce o si ha la fortuna di formare un match da 4 è davvero piacevole.- Per il tipo di gioco non è ancora possibile rientrare in partita in seguito a un crash..Il mio giudizio finale:Il gioco ha una curva di apprendimento adatta a tutti e se amate i giochi da tavolo questo vi piacerà sicuramente.Personalmente lo trovo rilassante e apassionante, da sempre quella sensazione di sfida e di sorpresa (che carte usciranno? a volte si può passare da una situazione di vantaggio allo svantaggio o viceversa in pochissimi turni), ogni partita è diversa pur con le stesse meccaniche e una tira l'altra come le ciliege.Di sicuro lo consiglio vivamente a tutti i fan della saga, ma è una ottima alternativa anche per tutti i casual gamers in cerca di un passatempo e una sfida diversa dal solito.ENGLISHI've been playing this game ever since its Beta and even it hadn't half of the current features I enjoyed it very much.You play by completing objectives with the given abilities (different for every protagonist) and rolling the dice, and win by having the highest number of Victory Points.The game's learning curve is not hard, but you need to know your character's abilities and to optimize your turn in order to win. However luck plays a big role during your matches, as not all cards give benefits, and the game is rich of dangers and obstacles.In the whole it feels like every match is different and unpredictable, giving this game an infinite replayability.You will probably want to play the game for its multiplayer feature, but it also has a singleplayer mode which can be enjoyed to play against oneself. However I found AI a bit casual and stupid (it feels like computers move are totally random and don't fit the mission objectives), which devs may want to correct. On the other hand, multiplayer still need to be properly populated, you may have to wait to form a match, but if you're able to gather 4 players it is lot of fun.This game loses a bit if your network crashes frequently or if your computer enters in conflict with it, as there's no way to re-join previously quitted games yet.Finally, they could probably do something to improve a little bit Yarpen, which I feel being slightly disadvantaged compared to the other heroes.If you like board games and/or you're a fan of the Witcher saga this game could probably be a must for you, and you would enjoy it in any case. If you're a casual gamer or are looking for something different to spend your time over, a new way of challenging people, or a relax moment, this game fits your wishes.(I'm not an experienced reviewer, I hope to be of help, leave below any question or comment);Recommended;35.5;16/01/2015;49;N/I
CD Projekt Red;The Witcher Adventure Game;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 29,99;The Witcher Adventure Game is a surprisingly well made digital board game adaptation, which massively shines during multiplayer due to its depth and an absolutely stunning amount of content as well as immaculate love for detail.The target audience is a small niche though, as is is made for diehard Witcher fans and boardgame enthusiasts alike. For most people of the general public not belonging to both of these groups it might start to feel a bit convoluted as time passes, yet the game itself remains one of the best digital boardgames I personally have played in the last couple of years.Do recommend.

CD Projekt Red;The Witcher Adventure Game;Adventure, Strategy;R$ 29,99;I would have liked to give this game a good review but I cannot. The singleplayer AI is absolutely horrible so offline mode isn't any fun after you learn the game. Online is horribly unbalanced due to Triss being able to teleport around acquiring 2 leads per turn compared to the other characters 1, thus completing the quests 2x as fast as the other characters. Every 3 game match I get into with a halfway decent triss player completes the third quest in 14-20 turns while everyone else is finsihing their first or getting onto their second. This would be an easy fix to simply allow the teleport card to be used before travel only or limit only 1 lead from travelling per turn.Its also quite annoying how you can't directly hinder an opponent, You might draw a card randomly by chance to slightly hinder them but it's nothing significant and will likely hurt you just as much. Other than the balance and horrible AI it is a pretty fun game though;Not Recommended;23.7;9/05/2015;90;6

2K Games;XCOM 2;Strategy;R$ 99,90;So this game is quite an interesting one. I played and attempted it several times since I own and love X-Com Enemy Within. It bested me each time and left me in quite a seething rage at points. I decided to give it another go with the War of The Chosen expansion coming and I have to say that this game did finally win me over. This game can be brutally hard to you. It really expects you to take your time and think about your moves for the first half of the game. You get a little more leeway once you get to the second half and you have some vetern soldiers and their abilities. Let me address the most controversial topic first, the mission timers.        Coming from EW I hated them and it felt like they were everywhere. Having finally beaten the game I can say that it's roughly 50% of the missions are timed and I really came to enjoy them. They change up the primary tactic of move, overwatch and they make sense thematically.  I only lost one mission with them and that was my fault of not planning properly. There are mods on the workshop that alter them but I think you should give them a go as the developers intended first. They create a great sense of tension and you really have to evaluate your moves each turn. I love optimizing stuff and this really became great fun once I got the hang of them. Just expect to lose a few times while you learn how those missions play out.       For those of you new to the Xcom series just know that these games run a reverse difficulty curve, they are hard in the beginning and get easier as the game progresses. Most the difficulty also comes from not knowing really where to begin. The game does not do a great job of making things clear to you. I did have to watch some videos and do some reading to really get a good grasp of the game. Also it doesn't make it clear what negative effects come from not attempting missions. I got a mission for a supply raid which I didn't attempt and the aliens ended up recapturing that territory. I didn't expect that and it wasn't communicated to me that that would be the result. The game likes to omit other valuable tacital data as well so I highly recommend the following mods:Stop Wasting My TimeShow Health ValuesPatrol When RevealedPerfect InformationGotchaThey save time in game but reducing certain animations and they really help you make informed moves each turn. I feel like Gotcha is a must have and something the developers should've included in the game to begin with. I'd also recommend some the communties mod map packs so you avoid getting 'familiar' maps. I also personally like It's Just A Scratch just because I think armor should actually protect you not just increase your health.          This game ran smooth as butter the entire time with a couple of exceptions. When I destroyed lots of objects all at once and a couple times in the final mission. Otherwise I got a steady 60 fps and load times were between 5-30 seconds. It does have some minor bugs. The most frequent one I would get is where I would click on an ability and the character would instantly do it. Very annoying when I needed my last grenade for something useful. Also sometimes the character models can get inside of each other. Visually jarring but the game still treats them as being on seperate squares so not game breaking.          Would I recommend you buy it? Absolutely, so long as you are ok losing a few times to learn the game. It's a fantastic strategy game and one of my personal favorites. What really got me with this game was how truly fair it actually did seem. Even in the face of overwhelming odds, smart tactical play saved me many times and it felt very rewarding. Honestly this game reminds me of dark souls a lot. It isn't just about the stats of your in game characters, it's about the knowledge you gain as well. I hope to see you out there Commander.;Recommended;168.7;23/06/2017;233;4
2K Games;XCOM 2;Strategy;R$ 99,90;A sequel to the amazing XCOM: Enemy Unknown. XCOM 2 expands on it's predecesor in nearly every fashion. Strategy is deeper, the customization is deeper, and the layers of story that you build with your squad is as great as well have come to expect from the series. One of the biggest complaints that I hear are the mission timers. Thankfully, the developers at Firaxis have intergrated their own mod tools into the game to support modding, something the last game lacked. With these mods, you can disable those pesky timers, add customization options, or take yourself for a ride in the thrilling Long War 2;Recommended;261.1;22/06/2017;433;15
2K Games;XCOM 2;Strategy;R$ 99,90;TLDR:XCOM 2 is a pretty great turn-based strategy game about killing aliens. You command a platoon of customizable soldiers that begin as rookies and over time become seasoned veterans with skills dictated by your decisions in skill trees. There is a fair variety of alien villains that you will encounter in map missions to keep you on your toes. The game features certain hardcore gameplay elements such as soldiers permanently dying if they are not recovered/are abandoned during missions and an opt-in ironman mode where you only play with one save data. Be wary of common RNG shenanigans such as missing shots that are predicted at 90%+ accuracy. XCOM 2 also has a large variety of mods available in the Steam Workshop. would highly recommend players to check those out on subsequent playthroughs.GENRE:Turn-based strategy, base & troop management, killing aliensGAMEPLAY:There are two main portions of the game. Firstly, game missions are the more active half where you command a number of soldiers through a map chunk with an objective to complete such as to kill all aliens, destroy a target, or rescue a key personnel. You command troops through the grid-based map and take actions based on the number of action points they possess each turn. these actions include movement, use weapon (fire gun, melee), reload, use items, and go on overwatch (aka set up an ambush if an enemy enters line of sight). Your troops gain experience for taking part in missions and killing enemies.The second half of the game is the base and troop management. Outside of the missions, you are tasked with upgrading your base of operations by commanding the research team to discover new tech that you can employ such as base upgrades and new weapons and engineering new troop upgrades like usable items in the field and improved armor. There is a "calendar" portion of this section in that your actions need to counter the enemy alien activity. if the alien activity reaches a certain point by a given deadline, your game will automatically end. In the beginning it is pretty easy to lower the enemy's activity progress but it gets more difficult as the game goes on. Therefore, you need to strategically decide which missions you want to accept. do you want to get more money so you can buy more necessary supplies or do you want to complete a mission to give yourself more time and lower the enemy's activity bar?GRAPHICS:XCOM 2 maps range from narrow city streets to quiet forest encounters and snowy bases. In particular missions, the alien bases look very high tech and are equipped with incredible weaponry. XCOM 2 can be a bit demanding in the graphics/performance department. The game has improved/enhanced visuals compared to XCOM: Enemy Unknown as soldiers, aliens, and overall map environments all have higher textures/details. STORY:XCOM 2 takes place in a time after the conclusion of the previous game XCOM: Enemy Unknown (you don't need to have played XCOM:EU to play XCOM 2). The aliens have assumed supreme power over the human race, and a covert operation is being run to find the commander (the player) in order to fight back against the alien menace. Will you be able to take back humanity from the alien hoard?STRENGTHS:•Gameplay in the missions feels good and pretty fair. You need to strategically move your soldiers around the maps to gain as much advantage as you can in order to minimize the potential losses as much as possible. This can be done by utilizing cover, gaining height advantage for increased accuracy, and setting up overwatch points to obliterate enemies before they discover you. •Soldier customization is a nice feature: you can customize all of your soldiers including their names, nationalities/voices, their appearance, their names, and even their biographies if you are so inclined. This can give you a form of immersive attachment to your troops in that you can view your dead soldiers' summaries while at your base (RIP to all of your future rookies). •The game can be as challenging as you want it to be: easy enough to breeze through and experience the game quickly, or very hard & ironman mode to completely test your strategy RPG skills. •There are a lot of mods available on the Steam workshop. These include new soldier customizations, UI changes, new weapons, new classes, and more. However, be sure to distinguish if mods require DLC or not (e.g. some mods require War of the Chosen (WOTC)). WEAKNESSES:•RNG can be a coin toss at times. A shot could say that you have a 96% chance of hitting, but then the shot misses and you are left wondering just what the heck happened. It's not a common occurrence, but it can happen enough to be noticeable. •You can't save scum your actions. if your shot misses you can't quickload your last save and try again to get a different result.•Last time I played, I remember there were some long loading screens right before a mission began.NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9/10The game is an easy recommend for players who enjoy other strategy RPG games like the Fire Emblem series. There is a fair amount of content to play with, and killing aliens is always a good time.  Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. "Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards" is a waste of everyone's time.

2K Games;NBA 2K21;Simulation, Sports;None;It would honestly be fair to call 2K an evil company at this point. There are only two options. either the company is staffed solely by incompetent developers who are incapable of creating a functioning game OR, much more likely, they knowingly, annually, decide to tighten the screws of their monopoly around the heads of literally millions of kids who shell out billions of dollars in revenue to this company every year.We can talk about rampant cheating, abysmal AI, or the horrific optimization that is sure to make even a beginer-level programmer cry himself to sleep. I, however, think it is much more interesting to talk about the scam itself: to purposefully make the game unbearable throughout every facet of its gameplay. The sheer malignance of such behavor is difficult to understand for normal people, but here it is important to understand how financial incentives choke the life out of every argument for game improvements that is not bounded in optimizing the "revenue stream."As a monopoly 2K has no incentive to make anything "well." There is simply no reason to. If you like basketball simulators there is only one game to play. 2K has acknowledged this in their earnings reports before, as far as I am aware. Making the game unplayable is actually profitable. If you drip-feed as little fun and engagement to your players as humanly possible and hide even this behind as many paywalls as possible, you create the illusion that "once you pay just a *bit* more the game will get fun," but it just never does. It's economics for elementary schoolers, and it works magic. It's a freemium game that you pay 60 euros for every year. A cash cow only rivaled by the Madden/FIFA franchises.The only people who get lost and stepped on in this process are all of us players, who succumb to a love of basketball every year, and every year walk away disappointed. The worst thing is that I'll probably keep playing. I'll suffer through 10-15% of every mycareer game consisting of advertisements and skippable-after-a-while cutscenes. I'll suffer through trying again and again for literally hours to get games in the rec center, only for my teammates to lag out for the 10th time, or for the entire opposing team to consist of 110-everything-with-every-badge-in-the-game hackers. I'll get booted/dc'd/lagged out in a hundred different ways, while walking a tightrope trying to avoid the myriad of game-breaking bugs and glitches that the game """features"""And for what? Because Lord forgive me I can't windmill dunk in real life, so allow me to do it digitally pls.When I - rarely - watch anything featuring 2K developers talking about their "love for the fans" or how much the game means to them, all I can think about is how they can possibly be so disrespectful. The solutions are not difficult, they are not even expensive or technically demanding, and yet they will never be implemented. It pays so much more dividends to invest in "2KTV" or the new look of the neighborhood. It's a slap in the face of every player, every day of every week of every month of every year. If I met any of the developers in real life I would tell them to their face that I hope everyone they've ever known are ashamed of them. And if any developers are reading this: you are working for the Monsanto of the video game industry. Every day you lie and cheat and scam is hopefully another step on your route to social leper status. Enjoy our money, and my unbridled disgust.;Not Recommended;278.2;5/12/2020;2,43;141

2K Games;Mafia III;Action, Adventure;R$ 169,99;Honest review after 40 hoursI usually do not bother taking time to write reviews, but I feel like doing it this time around. I have played Mafia 3 on PC for around 40hrs now and taken my time to explore the world as well as knock off story missions. I still got a few districts and one capo to go, but I believe I have played enough to get an idea of what Mafia 3 is and what it is not.So, right off the bat, I can say that Mafia 3 is consistent. Is it consistently good? Well, no. It is not. But it does deliver a solid story-driven and consistent experience with its many shortcomings and few bright moments. As a fan of the Mafia series (and true gangster movies in general), I cannot say that I was too hyped for this edition taking us into the world of Lincoln and his story of revenge. I guess to me a perfect Mafia game would go somewhere along the lines of Mafia 2. Starting out as a piss poor Italian immigrant and working your way up in organized crime, eventually becoming a made man and having money, influence and reputation. However, I do respect the artistic direction the developers have taken by going with Lincoln and his story. It is has kept me playing for 40h, so I guess it is safe to say that is not bad. In fact, I think the story might just be the strongest element of this game.There are some other pros as well, as listed below:Weapons (and shooting) feel(s) oddly satisfying and reminiscent of some older (read: better) Hitman games.Cover system works pretty darn well.The stealth approach actually works as opposed to GTA V. So, using silenced weapons makes sense.Soundtrack is great (although it does get a bit repetitive rather soon).The environment and setting of New Orleans in this particular period seems authentic.Districts feel distinct and authentic.Cut scenes are nicely done and help flesh out the game (voice acting is actually better than I expected).Connection to real life events back in the day (news on radio, articles in Hot Rod and Playboy, depiction of racism, etc.) make the experience more immersive. That being said, as a rather demanding gamer, I would not in good conscience recommend this game to my friends! Why? Well, let us get started on the negative. Shall we?The worst PC port of any AAA game in living memory. I mean, for crying out loud, Metal Gear Solid has been a console-only franchise for almost 20 years and even they did a decent job on the port for MGS V (UI aside).Bad port leads to questionable optimization and performance issues. In max settings, it runs around 45 fps on 980ti and i5-4690k. I get better frames in both GTA V and Witcher 3 (ultra settings), for comparison. And while this game looks okay, it does not even come close to Witcher 3 in the graphics department.Graphics. Overall, it does not look bad. It is just, in this case, paradoxically inconsistent. Bayou looks gorgeous, especially during sunrise or sunset. Car models, however, leave a lot to be asked for. Especially in terms of LODs. Oh yeah.. and to say that lighting and reflections are bad would be an understatement.    Vehicle damage modelling and virtually non-existent deformation! I mean it has to be a joke right? The first Mafia had about the same level of vehicle deformation 12 freaking years ago! This is quite possibly the most disappointing aspect of this game. We are on "next-gen" with all this processing power, etc. and the developer was unable or unwilling to make a proper vehicle damage and deformation system for the open world game that has vehicles as one of its central elements.AI is sub-par as well. The enemy combat AI provides a lackluster challenge even on the hardest setting. Also, it does not respond at all to screaming and running civilians who should be an obvious indication that something fishy is taking place. While the NPCs manage the driving pretty well (except your gun delivery guy or cash collector girl), the pedestrians tend to be completely ignorant to the moving cars and environment around them.Game design. Eliminating the lower level gangsters and racket bosses and doing the wiretaps gets very repetitive really fast. It just lacks variety. I understand it is an open world game, but some memorable scripted missions are always great. The missions to eliminate Olivia and Lou were good. I just feel that Mafia 3 does not quite have the right balance between meaningful open world activities and high quality scripted story-telling.Intrusive HUD. If the aim is to build a nice looking open world, why on earth would you want to break the immersion with ridiculous HUD elements like the GPS "road signs" in Mafia 3? It is not quite as intrusive and bad of a solution as Watch Dogs had for its GPS, but it is still pretty darn disturbing. Wouldn't the GTA V-style radar-based navigation be enough?. No option to have multiple saves.Multiple CTDs and obvious bugs within the game world itself (cars driving around with open doors, enemy ragdolls getting stuck in the walls, etc).User interface in menus. Again, due to being a console port. Now to the (great) parts from the previous games that were for some unfortunate reason not included in this one:Enforcement of traffic laws by police. Getting a ticket for speeding or running a red light, made the previous Mafia games feel immersive and set them apart from GTA series. It was a nice way of interacting with the police other than getting shot by them. Back in the days of the first Mafia game, it was a cool innovation that made the player feel that the environment responded to player's actions in a realistic manner. Makes me wonder why the speedometer (another intrusive HUD element) was added to this game at all.Vehicle and clothing based search warrants. It was a nice system of how the police was able to recognize you in 2 different ways once the line of sight was lost. In this edition, you just need to get out of the "magic" circle and suddenly there is no interest in your crime anymore.The fuel system, while sometimes tedious, was also a nice element that increased immersion.What I feel this game is missing:More (micro)management of your conquered territories and your own organization and capos. You just give the districts to your capos and that is it! There is so much potential and replay value there that is just ignored. If only you could try to keep hold of your districts and rackets against other aspiring criminals once the main story is done, etc.I understand that Lincoln's story is that of revenge and as such he has little interest in anything else. However, once that story is done and The Marcanos are well six feet under or in the bellies of Bayou crocs, it would be nice to spend that hard earned cash on something other than weaponry (such as properties, cars, clothes, etc.). The side story of any Mafia game ought to be making money and rising up in the world and what is the point of that if there is nothing to spend it on?All in all, Mafia 3 is not a bad game, but unfortunately it is somewhat of a disappointment. Mainly because this game had so much potential, but failed to deliver in many more areas than it got right. It is missing the WOW-factor that the first Mafia game certainly had and that is generally expected from highly marketed open world games and well known franchises of this caliber. It does not excel in any single category and, as such, remains consistent in its mediocrity. The strongest elements of this game are its story-driven campaign and the authentic feel of New Orleans back in the 60s. That it does deliver. Unfortunately, these only get you so far. In spite of the nice open world, it does not seem to have a lot going for it once the story is done. For me, as a hard core fan of the 2 previous Mafia games, it is a definite let-down.;Not Recommended;66.2;11/10/2016;463;5

2K Games;Mafia III;Action, Adventure;R$ 169,99;It took me almost 23h but I finished it.Here's what I think about it after beating it.Pros:- Really cool atmosphere of 60s. Huge detailed city and great soundtrack add to it quite a bit.- Solid story with great characters and awesome voice acting.- Solid game mechanics - shooting, driving, cover system, etc - all works well, but there's nothing really new about them.Cons:- My biggest gripe with it - it doesn't make you feel like you are mafia- AI is pretty much brain dead. Especially if you are using stealth approach.- Repetitive samey side-quests that are forced onto you as gates to main quests- Poor optimisation (performance-wise this game sucks on most machines, even after a bunch of patches)- Little variety of cars and guns- Lots of things hidden behind unlocks that are too boring to achieve (wanna get that rocket launcher? be ready to do more side quests, if you are not sick from them yet!)- Game has a bunch of pretty meaningless unlocks, instead of giving you fun stuff (e.g. unlock to steal cars quietly, that comes after an ability to call in car delivery)- No fast travel - and since city is big, be ready to spend quite some time traveling aroundAnd in general, the game feels as if they didn't have enough time to finish the game properly.If they'd allow only doing story missions (the most fun part) and beating the game in ~6h or so - it'd be so much better in my opinion. Unfortunately, now you have to fight those boring gate-quests to get to fun stuff. Which is.. well, not fun.I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it at full price.

I can't complain about a ripoff or anything like that since I bought the game for 5 bucks, but as a fan of the original Mafia games I just feel let down.

(Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game.Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.Result:Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team  do it properly.

That's this entire game essentially, yet somehow worse.-Speaking of repetitive, you literally go back to the exact same areas and do the exact same things in very short periods of time.-Something about the gunplay feels off and so does the driving.-Even on hard, the enemy AI is useless. -The lack of content that wasn't there at launch despite being shown in trailers like changeable clothes just highlights how much of an unfinished mess this was.-Despite updates to add new features and slightly improve performance, this game still full of glitches and crashes on a more than capable machine. -In general, the game looks awful. Its far more bland than the colourful screenshots used in advertisements and the games lighting in infamously abysmal.-Despite the well written story, there is so much padding between key story missions that I'd forget what was happening.

Sega;Total War: Three Kingdoms;Action, Strategy;R$ 149,99;My pedigree: ~500 hours Shogun 2 (+Darthmod), ~300 hours Warhammer 1, mostly played Very Hard.I'm not a Total War expert but I understand most of its principles. Though I'm only a few hours into Three Kingdoms I'd like to point out some highlights here as most reviews I read were too abstract and didn't signal the major differences 3K has from older Total War games.Military:In general battles resemble Shogun 2 with its spear/sword/ranged/cavalry/siege basic archetypes. Units are arranged to maximize rock-paper-scissors match-ups, and generally volume wins. However there is the notable shake-up of:-Romance Mode-  this essentially makes the generals like heroes from Warhammer, for better or worse. Strong 1v1 generals will win battles, period. Dueling and killing generals will crush morale and cheese fights just like targeted damage spam from Warhammer. The AI is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot win, and even when they reject them you can simply right-click on them and get the same result. So far I have not seen any troops be effective against high-stat generals — it's common to outmaneuver an invasion using your garrison troops to route the enemy only to have their general stick around and solo your remaining squads.Of course if you don't like that you can simply play Records mode, which I haven't tried yet.-Roster-Although all units fall into classic archetypes, there are more units than reviews insinuated. Most of these are gated behind general archetypes and technology. I can see these units substantially affecting the outcome of fights if you can afford them. An example: auto-crossbow units from high-Cunning generals will grant you a highly cost-effective ranged unit at the expense of a very weak general. This might be a good choice for a defensive army that has walls to garrison.-Military Supply-This is the largest difference from previous titles in terms of military. All armies have a pool of 100 supplies that slowly fills in your own territory and rapidly drains in enemy territory and during the winter — 30 lost to enemey territory, another 25 for winter (even in your own territory). Once your supplies hit zero you suffer massive attrition losses. This can be improved with infrastructure and character traits, but without significant investments the net effect is that distant campaigns and prolonged sieges are extremely high-risk. Aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion. This, combined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacements, forces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense. Gone are the days of spamming Ashigaru to handle an unexpected attack, or endlessly raiding a territory while waiting for reinforcements. Likewise the AI can't use these strategies, solving the cat-and-mouse games everyone hated in Warhammer.Strategy layer:This is where I feel this game really shines compared to its predecessors. There are many new mechanics here that are brilliantly interlaced. One decision often begets 6 more, requiring lots of forethought.-Commanderies (a.k.a. provinces)-This has been made far more complicated than previous titles. The game features a massive web of building trees, each replete with collateral effects and synergies that make you consider the province as a whole rather than the usual one-problem-one-building method we're used to. Compounding this is the commanderies system — known as provinces in Warhammer, these are groups of territories that are designed to be held together. One territory of a commandery will contain the city and most of the buildings, while attached territories will contain an exclusive building tree. Because building synergies are so powerful you are highly incentivized to own an entire commandery instead of mere parts. This adds more intrigue to expansionist aggression as well as the excellent diplomacy system — with good relations the AI will gladly trade territories of equal value with you.-Staff-Managing your administration is a large component of 3K. Even with optimal buildings you will not have enough income without the right staff multiplying their benefits. Each staff's personality quirks will play heavily into what managing them will entail — in general you want to hire like-minded people to reduce conflict and maximize satisfaction, but it is also important to hire personalities who satisfy the needs of your economy (vanguards are better for industry, commanders for peasants, etc). Black sheep can still be effective so long as they're kept away from their associates. Failing to satisfy them can have heavy consequences — people with significant power in your government can even start a civil war. In my first run I found myself occasionally firing people I hired with insufficient foresight to avoid showering them in promotions or letting tensions boil over.One final layer worth mentioning: all of these characters are persistent and historied, often having served other leaders before you. This mostly has implications with Espionage which I'm not experienced enough to talk about yet.-Diplomacy-In Shogun 2 all of the leaders seemed like schizophrenics with borderline disorder, refusing trade and breaking alliances randomly. In Warhammer diplomacy was hardly possible at all. From that low bar 3K has made massive improvements. Leaders are generally more reasonable and fit their ascribed personalities well. Diplomatic intrigue has so far satisfied me more than any Total War or 4x.The same diplomatic options from Shogun and Total War are present, but you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often. Items, payments, and marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreements, and territories can be traded to mutual benefit. Enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall. Cao Cao can stir the pot with the ability to start proxy wars.The confederation system is the icing on the cake. Forging large confederations will require you to navigate carefully, as new members must be approved by a majority of existing ones, and voting in opposition of members will sour your relations. Furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak. That means order is important, and you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first. All of this complicates your expansionism, perhaps forcing you to take risks on distant campaigns rather than upset an ally, or an ally's-ally, by attacking your borders.Performance:If you're a Total War veteran you know why this section is here. I'm playing on this rig[www.userbenchmark.com] and the game runs flawlessly on a 2k 144hz monitor and looks great even with swarms of units on screen. If you're new to Total War and don't have an SSD, buy one. The more battles you have the more time you'll spend loading. I've been enjoying 5 second loads on my M.2.TL.DRIn total the game becomes slow and deliberate compared to its predecessors, which largely devolved into paint-by-numbers spamfests. Controlled growth is key, and many decisions will require you to think several turns ahead. If you're playing Total War with an emphasis on battles with diverse armies and lots of spectacle you will be more at home in Warhammer, but hardcore strategists will love this game.I hope this wall of text was useful;Recommended;26.8;27/05/2019;1,972;37

Sega;Total War: Three Kingdoms;Action, Strategy;R$ 149,99;As a long time Total War fan, I wasn't looking forward to this one.  I have no interest in the time period or location.  My favorites in the series are rome 2 and the warhammer series.  I decided to give three kingdoms a try, and now I don't think I can ever go back.  It is so good, it makes every previous TW seem archaic.  Specifically, diplomacy and the campaign side of things have been improved so much.  The choices you make affect so much more with coalitions, alliances, and vassals.  There is a lot more character development, to the point that you care so much about your council members, family members, and allies.  These individuals become intertwined, forcing you to really think about each negotiation.  Indeed, if you lose a general you care about, your other generals in battle will go berserk with rage if they have developed a good relationship.Another impressive feat is performance.  Aside from a weird UI issue on the campaign map side, battles play absolutely beautiful.  I have engaged large battles as often as I can to really push my computers limit (i7 7700k, 16GB Ram, 1080 Duke video card) and I rarely get a noticable drop.  As a side note, the music is awesome.  Whether it's when a battle is about to commence or during the battle itself, the fanfare really draws you in.three kingdoms has not just set a standard for the TW series. it's set a standard for strategy games.  You can tell how much work went in to this game and how much attention to detail there is.  It is truly an impressive experience, and I can't recommend it enough.;Recommended;536.6;28/05/2019;552;9

Sega;Total War: Three Kingdoms;Action, Strategy;R$ 149,99;Before I start I would like to say this is my first total war game, I also spent a significant chunk of time of my childhood growing up in China but I will leave the review in English both as a practice to my writing but also I feel like it might be interesting to portray my thoughts to people from a different culture about a game that takes place on my homeland. The gameplay is addicting and captivating to strategy game fans that makes you say "One more turn before bed" to yourself constantly. One of the very first video game I touched was Starcraft 2 back in 2010, so I really enjoy the fact that there are real time combat in a turn based strategy game, it feels refreshing after playing SC2 for years and hundreds hours of Civilization.I also really really enjoy the music, there are not many tracks which is a downside, but I absolutely love how they did the music. Here is one of my favorite piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MYAzRwrscQ The music make use of several ancient Chinese instrument and weaves them together into a beautiful masterpiece.The overall visual is very beautiful to look at, not stunning, but really easy on the eyes, the campaign map of China uses vibrant colors to show contrast between rivers, land and trees, not only is the campaign map beautiful to look at, there are also peasants working on the fields, soldiers patrolling the main road,  pandas eating bamboos, and hunters hunting wild animals. making the entire map feel alive, small details goes a long way.Now let me talk about something I feel is lacking about this game:the multiplayer is somewhat lacking, when I play a co-op match, even after I signed the shared victory treaty I still can't reinforce my partner's army, I have to wait till I rank up to form a coalition to be able to do so, doing so makes the fact that the first half of a co-op game is just minding their own business, it's worse that sometimes you won't be able to see each other for a good 50 turns if you pick two factions that have distant starting locations.**Update 11/22/2021: It's been months since CA abandoned this game, a shame but my review still stands that this is a good game. Please note to get the 1.7.1 bug fix mod on workshop as it fixes many of the bugs that CA will never fix.**;Recommended;811.9;3/07/2019;356;12

Sega;Sonic Mania;Action, Adventure, Casual;R$ 99,50;I'd like you all to know that this review is coming from someone that never played the classic titles upon beating this game. Thanks for understanding.So, I like to say that as i have beaten the main game with all characters including Mighty and Ray i think i have the right to write a review based on Sonic Mania. Upon starting up the game i didn't know what i was getting into expect for knowing that Green Hill and Chemical Plant Zone were going to be in the game knowing that they are memorable video game levels. But after beating the game five times. Every stage i played were all memorable and all had fun gimmicks to accompany them. A personal favorite of mine that isn't Green Hill or Chemical Plant was HydroCity zone which made me go "jolly they made a water level fun!" So, our playable line of characters are:Sonic- Everyone favorite Sega Mascot who basically plays the same in the other games but with this game they have the ability to do a dropdash which i didn't use much to be fairly honest.Tails- The two tailed fox who has the ability to fly which is basically the easy mode of the game if i want to be honest and are just a reskin of Sonic but they can flyKnuckles- A echidna who can glide and climb on walls who is the hard mode of the game given that he also has a reduce jump height other thing to know is that parts of the level is unique to Knuckles which adds something new to the tableMighty- A armadillo that can do a ground pound which plays the same as sonicRay- A flying squirrel that can glide but with enough downforce can go back up to gain height as a way to flyThe Level Design: The level design of Sonic Mania is something that i enjoy for the most part since levels are meant to be replay to find new routes and find all the hidden special stages that are hidden in each zone. During my five different playthroughs i always found new routes that i never found back in my first playthrough thanks to what the character brought to the table or just pure curiosity that came across my mind.The Music:The music is something that i enjoyed to the fact that its hard to choose a personal favorite. I love the new remixes of old tracks like Green Hill Zone Act 2 and Chemical Plant Zone Act 2 which I should also mention that I enjoy how each act of a zone has different music but are yet familiar to keep in check with the tone and setting of the zones.Overall Score: 10/10Why I give it a 10/10? My reasoning is that this is one of the games that I played and i enjoyed it so much that I want to come back to it which is my personal favorite classic sonic game as of now. Despite the game not being a 2021 title I think this is my goty even though this was made back in 2017.

Sega;Yakuza 0;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 89,50;Yakuza 0? Hah, more like 1000 Ways to Hospitalize Someone with Household Supplies & Furniture: The Game.You get to play as a young Japanese man quitting his job (pretty much equivalent to death in Japan) and avoiding his former employer’s severance package of death by using the basic thuganomics of real estate combined with straight up beating the finances out of any hostile person wearing a suit. If that’s not rad, I don’t know what is.On the other side of the coin, you also get to play Diner Dash as a breakdancing bat/knife wielding club manager cyclops with a harem. Who tries to get back into his previous occupation, but ends up getting into a crazy chain of events after discovering his newfound kink for blind girls. Holy sh*t.And that’s simply the main story, the sidequests/substories have almost as much meat while being just as succulent. Instead of cookie cutter content where you collect 20 bear pelts or some crap like that, there are wholesome and heartwarming sidequests such as. helping a minor acquire an adult magazine, shutting down a religious cult scam, a 1v1 disco duel against the King of Pop, etcetera. Even the official description includes its own example of “help a budding S&M dominatrix learn her profession” which is surprisingly a real sidequest.Speaking of side content, oh man. You remember those dime a dozen 27 in 1 games? The minigames in here are essentially those, but jacked up on whatever medicinal healing drinks these guys use.Minigames include activities fitting for the 80s like disco, karaoke (Heartbreak Mermaid fav song, let’s go boyz) and telephone dating clubs. Hell, you can play a game within a game in an arcade featuring classic Sega games, namely Space Harrier and Outrun (Ferrari Testarossa Convertible hnnng). There is most importantly fishing because you got to have it in an open world game these days and there’s even MF’ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bear sodomizing mah-jong in here.One could yada yada endlessly about the amount of juicy content in this game, but judging from simply this it’s safe to assume this game is an absolute steal at its US$19.99 pricetag.;Recommended;106.1;6/07/2019;679;173
Sega;Yakuza 0;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 89,50;I've seen a lot of reviews try to win people over with an endless list of amusing anecdotes - winning chickens in a bowling game and making them a real estate manager. Training a dominatrix to be more assertive. Obliterating people in combat with a motorcycle.It's all true, of course. Yakuza 0 can be an immensely funny and absurd game with moments that's genuinely make you laugh out loud - largely because you could have never expected them.But I also think that's had the side effect of selling the game short. You might think this is a comedy game, something that is almost lighthearted or trivial.It's not.Yakuza 0 is a very serious game - a fact you might find surprising. Its plot is complex and is centered on a fairly dry subject of real estate intrigue in a booming market. It deals with mature, often terrible issues and has a cast of immensely realistic - and likable - characters set in an equally realistic city. Yakuza has the pacing and tone of a drama, and it must be enjoyed slowly like one.The comedy, then, is not the driver of this game, but rather serves as a much needed relief of tension. It's almost like there's a swinging pendulum in which the game is allowed to present you with increasingly intense and dramatic moments so long as it's all offset by an equally increasing level of absurdity. It helps space out the moments of self-seriousness in a way that just...works.Beyond just the tone and story is a very enjoyable brawler that constantly mixes it up with minigames, tough bosses, and other diversions. I do want to stress that this isn't necessarily a game you're coming back to for the gameplay - rather, you'll be coming for the story, the characters, the city itself.This isn't a bad thing, though, and I wish more games would take this approach. Yakuza 0 is a wonderful game.PS: Whoever did the localization for Yakuza 0 is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ genius.;Recommended;327.4;14/08/2018;501;10

Sega;Yakuza 0;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 89,50;TLDR:If you are looking to get into the Yakuza series, 0 is probably the best place because it is chronologically the first game as it was released as a prequel to the first Yakuza game. Yakuza 0's story is amazing and has you on the edge of your seat all the time wondering what will happen next. The side content of minigames and substories is hilariously entertaining and helps to break up the story's serious side for a change of pace. The brawler combat also feels impactful and strategic as you change your combat stance in order to suit the situation at hand to defeat waves of street thugs and yakuza mobs alike. The game is almost always on sale at an affordable price so it is an easy recommend for players looking to dive into a series full of wacky characters, weird NPC encounters, and underworld criminal affairs.GENRE:Action combat, story-centric/cinematic cutscenes, 2 semi-sandbox style city maps to exploreGAMEPLAY:The game jumps back and forth depending on the story chapters between playing two characters: Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima. When you are in control of a character in the city worlds of Kamurocho or Sotenbori, you are usually free to either head towards a pink marker on the map indicating main story progress, or to wander around the city and do random side activities ranging from random NPC substories to playing minigames like karaoke or dancing in the disco.Proceeding with main story quests usually leads to long, voice-acted cutscenes where the story unfolds and has you usually entering combat to deal with a plethora of grunts, thugs, and yakuza officials. The story has you play as Kiryu or Majima and you don't switch between the characters at will, at least until you complete the main story. Both of their arcs are important to the overall plot though and each of them have completely different battle styles and distinct combat maneuvers.The combat in Yakuza 0 is action-based and determined by your button inputs. Based on your skill tree investments, your skills develop in 3 different styles per character4 if you finish the game. Each style is usually better suited for certain situations (e.g. Kiryu's Beast style is amazing if you are among a sea of objects lying around the area, or Majima's Slugger style is useful for hard-hitting 1v1 situations). Your attacks are determined by your combination of light strikes, heavy strikes, guards, and grabs. As you connect with your hits and avoid being hit, you build up the Heat meter and once that meter hits a certain threshold, you can perform Heat actions which are brutal, environmental assaults that help you inflict a large amount of damage at once.Side content rewards you with comical questlines, weird NPC's, fun minigames, and more often than not good money-making methods. You can run into a kid who wants you to buy a dirty magazine for him, a Michael Jackson look-a-like who wants you to help him with his next music video, and a guy who can't cross a bridge without getting beat up because of a jacket he refuses to take off. You can take a break and visit a SEGA arcade to play some old-school games, go to a karaoke and sing some great songs, go bowling, go fishing, and more. At certain points, you unlock character-specific businesses that you can run and let's just say Majima's cabaret club business is the best minigame/mini storyline just in fun factor.GRAPHICS:Yakuza 0 looks and runs great. It doesn't employ the use of Ryu Ga Gotoku's newest Dragon engine yet, but it still holds up in presentation and performance. Main characters look distinct and are well-animated, city streets are filled with bright and colorful lights indicative of Japanese culture, and I experienced no significant performance dips throughout the entire game.  STORY:[Deliberately vague to avoid spoilers as you should definitely experience it for yourself]Yakuza 0 takes place in Japan in the 1980's during an economic bubble where money is overflowing in the streets. You begin playing as Kiryu, a member of a Yakuza family doing collection work in Kamurocho when suddenly, you find yourself wanted for murder when you didn't commit it. It appears that someone is out to frame Kiryu, and that is where his story unfolds. Simultaneously, a man named Majima is managing a cabaret in Sotenbori and making a lot of money, but his goal is not to be Sotenbori's famed Lord of the Night. It seems Majima needs his money for a different reason...STRENGTHS:•Yakuza 0's story is incredible like the rest of the games in the series. It is full of surprising twists, the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Since it is a prequel, players who have played the original Yakuza games are able to learn the backstories of the original characters in Kiryu and Majima and how they became who they were. The overall story of 0 is an amazing roller coaster of emotions.•The music is amazing. each combat style has its own background soundtrack to match its mood perfectly, the disco and karaoke tunes are banging tunes (with full versions available on YouTube), and the main antagonists have their own unique tracks as well (Kuze's theme is phenomenal). •There is no English dub, but the Japanese voice-acting is very good. •You encounter a lot of great & memorable characters throughout the game (though let's just say don't get too attached to any of them).•The game's pacing is up to your preference. you can hot shot all of the main story in one go, or break it up when you feel bored and want to dance to "Friday Night" at the disco for a few minutes.•Majima's cabaret club is the best minigame. WEAKNESSES:•A common complaint I've seen is that the game often feels like you are watching a movie when you are not in combat. It is a valid point since in story situations, most of the time you are just listening to the Japanese VA and reading the dialogue as it auto-scrolls so it can feel like you are inactively participating. •Regarding the combat, it feels very unfair later on in the game when enemies start carrying guns and attacking you from a distance, instantly knocking you down to the ground with one bullet. This isn't an issue in the beginning, but the combat feels like it ramps up, not in difficulty but in BS, dramatically towards the climax. NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9/10Yakuza 0 is a great starting point for someone new to the series, is usually low in price, contains an amazing & captivating story, and is full of entertaining side activities. I would highly recommend anyone to play this game, and the other Yakuza games in general. Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. "Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards" is a waste of everyone's time.

Sega;Football Manager 2021;Free to Play, Sports;R$ 00,00;I don't normally do reviews, this game was Okay at the start, the fact that it was free made the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ worth it. I played a season and then downloaded SM 2022, but then I noticed, the director buying players that I didn't need and I was getting injuries every other week. So I went an downloaded SM 2021 again and the same thing started happening in 2021, every time I was trying to offload players to keep within the training numbers, the director would buy another player keeping me over the limit. Then the injuries started, after every single game I would have 1 or 2 players 'injured in training' despite them being in the match. Over a three day period I had 5 players injured in training, if that was real life I would have Health and Safety trying to close me down, I know it's not real life and I know it's only a game and a free one at that. But the game is becoming almost unplayable without buying in game 'help'. The football match I was playing has just finished and I have 3 email notifications telling me I have surprise, surprise 3 'players injured in training' all 3 were playing in the game. Now I know there is huge push to encourage me to 'buy in game help' and if I was the kind of person who wanted to cheat my way to the top, I might consider it, but I don't cheat and I don't like people trying to cheat me in to buying 'cheats'. The frustrating thing for me is the time I have put in to building my team and making sure I have updated my manager skills only for those managing skills (especially relating to injuries) to be proved pointless.;Not Recommended;44.4;27/12/2021;27;3

Sega;Alien: Isolation;Action;R$ 89,99;Beautiful game not without its flaws. But even after 6 years since its release, the attention to detail and overall integrity of the gameplay experience remains unmatched by most.The level of detail that went into the alien AI is incredible. Though it's "learning" is not a full-scale machine learning algorithm, SEGA built a much lighter-weight system that behaves just as well. To the casual player, the xenomorph latches on to your strategies and ensures the player doesn't brute force a level the same way over and over, for an incredibly immersive survival experience.Notable flaws to mention for the casual player:- The humans never run out of ammo.- Nightmare mode, though a fun challenge, was not scaled perfectly. Lockers are useless, and revolvers do far too much damage compared to shotguns- The game acts weirder the more times you load a save (without restarting the game) leading to unusual behaviors. - The game likes to drop inputs, especially at lower framerates.- The nature of how the alien hunts makes the game considerably harder for the casual player. By this I mean: The longer you stay in one place, the more "convinced" the alien is you're in that vicinity. Thus, by hiding, the game becomes more difficult. This is contrary to what would make sense by "playing it safe."- Novice mode, on the other end of the spectrum as nightmare, is also scaled down unusually. The alien is easily exploited because of this.- The biggest immersion-killer is the hard-on the xenomorph has for the player and only the player. You'll see this best when playing the game.- The map is very large and detailed, but as such, a bit intimidating. By going locker to locker on your way to the objective, it becomes incredibly easy to become lost. Most players forget that the motion tracker can also be used to find your way.- I think there are about 6 or 7 unique player models for insignificant players. Perhaps I only notice this because I have played the entirety of the game nearly 25 times, but you may start to notice it more and more on a casual run.I mention these things, not to demonstrate that the game is bad, but as key things I believe would have helped me when playing the game casually the first few times.Overall, I'd give this game a solid 9/10, especially for the player that likes a good challenge.;Recommended;954.5;14/04/2020;424;16

Sega;Alien: Isolation;Action;R$ 89,99;If there’s one game this year that I absolutely must give my faithfulness award to, it’s probably Alien: Isolation. I’m honestly having trouble thinking of a team of developers who clearly love the source material of their game and want to pay it an honest respect *more* than the developers behind Isolation at Creative Assembly. So much so that absolutely nothing is misplaced, although a few things are mishandled. Everything in Isolation is almost perfectly sculpted and placed to the point where you never have your immersion broken or get taken out of the story, and it’s crystal clear that Creative Assembly wanted to paint Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger’s original vision in a way that did it honor. And they have.The largest parts of that immersion can be boiled down to three features: graphic design, audio, and mechanics. Graphically, the game is absolutely stunning. Isolation aims to recreate Scott’s original style in the first Alien of “low fi sci fi”, and does it with perfection. Analog computers and cameras and voice recorders and huge, bulky spacesuits with 80’s GUIs. Believe me when I say that this is by far and away the most accurate and stellar portrayal of Alien in any other medium ever made. Second, the sound design: also, absolutely fantastic. Isolation uses the original score from the movie combined with eerie, high-tone background music that’s contrasted against it, and creates a mix of something that both astounds and terribly unnerves you at the same time. And finally, the mechanics, which, while they are a bit simplistic, lend themselves to the scenery that much more. There’s a lot of button pushing and primordial hacking and lever pulling in Isolation, which does wear thin after a while considering the standard formula is “get to location X” while avoiding everything in your way, but fortunately, this is circumvented by Isolation’s greatest strength: it’s fear factor.It’s been said that the best horror games have you just as terrified when something isn’t happening as when something is happening. Silent Hill 2 understood this. Amnesia: TDD understood this. And I’m glad to say Isolation does as well. The sound of the Alien crawling in the vents above you is constant, as well as the subliminal noises and creaks and bangs that keep your skin crawling, making you never aware when the Alien will drop down. And when it is on the screen, it’s fantastic. Creative Assembly have designed Giger’s Alien (there’s only one in this game) with virtually no scripting and mostly organic AI, creating the effective illusion that this is a real, breathing predator that searches rooms and doubles back and reacts to sound. It’s genuinely terrifying when you’re hiding in a locker, barely a metre away from the beast, knowing that if it turns right, it might hear you breathing or your motion tracker beeping, rip off the locker door and end you. That being said, with a lack of scripting comes some annoying and downright frustrating moments.The Alien can sometimes spend three or four minutes searching the room you’re hiding in and leaving you no chance to get away before it leaves, and other times it may just drop out of a vent right in front of you and leave you no chance to escape. And given that Isolation’s style of hacking and even saving requires you to leave yourself vulnerable for a few seconds (which, to be fair, does add to the horror factor), the game can be very unfair with how quickly and without warning you can be killed. This is both the greatest strength and weakness of the game: *NOTHING* you do is not potentially dangerous in some way. Sprinting down a hallway, using a save point, hacking a door, building an item... everything opens you up to a horrible death, and while that is incredibly atmospheric and nerve-wracking, at least a few times during your playthrough, you'll probably face a very unfair end. And the horror factor does tend to drain in the second half, when you're given a reliable method of defense against the Alien that keeps it at bay, and there's always someone talking in your ear, in contrast to the first half, where you're almost entirely alone and you have only molotovs to slow the Alien down, which are hard to craft, minimal and difficult to aim. So I feel the game could have benefitted by giving us fewer methods to defend ourselves.All that said, Isolation’s core is a solid, terrifying experience of a tride and true survival horror. It flies its colours well, and executes its design almost perfectly. There are some issues with the story what with it being very, very long, and the fact that you seem to have won multiple times before the game yanks the rug out from underneath you and tells you there’s a few more hours to go could be seen as annoying by some (though for me, I felt the game is paced and spread out enough that it was negligible). However, I felt that even getting to a save point in this game was a minor victory, and it makes the terrifying moments shine as bright as a star. Isolation’s concept is fantastic, its execution solid and its atmosphere astounding. For any Alien fan, for any survival horror connoisseur, and for any curious gamer that has enough money to reupholster their computer chair, this is a must-buy.My Rating: 9/10;Recommended;48.4;6/10/2014;1,615;18
Sega;Alien: Isolation;Action;R$ 89,99;“Game over man, game over!”The  Alien  franchise has, unfortunately, not had many games recapturing the feeling of the original Alien movie. Alien: Isolation attempts to change that by going the route of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, by  not  giving you pulse rifles or smart guns, and making the Xenomorph  not  die from small-arms fire. In other words, in this game your best friend is silence and the nearest table or locker. If this sounds like your kind of horror survival game, read on. Campaign The events of the game take place fifteen years after the events of the first Alien movie, and you play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, the protagonist from the aforementioned movie. Amanda is working as an engineer in the sector where the Nostromo – the ship her mother was traveling with – went missing, and when approached by a Weyland-Yutani employee – Samuels – who informs her that its flight recorder has been found, she quickly accepts his offer to come along and recover it.This takes you to Sevastopol, the space station housing the only trace Amanda has of her mother, and where she will play a deadly cat and mouse game with the same terrors that tormented her mother. Gameplay | Graphics | Sound Alien: Isolation is a stealth game that revolves around your ability to calmly assess the situation and take the best course of action to deal with the problem at hand in a manner that won't catch the attention of the Xenomorph. If you go into this game with a twitchy trigger finger and hopes of bumrushing it to the end, you're gonna have a bad time. Most of your time in the game will be spent hiding in lockers and under tables, clutching your motion tracker close and hoping that the Xenomorph didn't hear or see you. A Xenomorph that, by the way, has no set paths or routes, instead going wherever it pleases, whenever it pleases, but usually drawn in by noises, which only adds to the terror this creature will instill in you. The game includes a crafting system which allows you to craft items to distract your enemies with, but it is in no way required. Over-reliance on your distraction tools can even be disadvantageous. And if you want to battle your friends in who can score the highest, there's Survivor Mode. This pits you against the Xenomorph in a small area from which you need to escape, and you'll earn points depending on how many optional objectives you completed and the time you took to escape, which then get uploaded to the Leaderboards. The Xenomorph is extremely aggressive in this mode, and you too need to be more daring and aggressive to counter the timer.Visually, the game is absolutely gorgeous, and you owe it to yourself to play it on the highest settings. From beads of sweat on the foreheads of survivors to the best looking fire effects I have seen to date, it is truly a feast for the eyes. The sounds are phenomenal across the board, and you really  should   need   a good sound system for this game, certainly with surround capabilities, and preferably headphones. Listening for the Xenomorph is far more reliable – and terrifying – than your motion tracker.   Flaws The unpredictability of the Xenomorph can in certain areas mean you get stuck in lockers for long periods of time, especially on higher difficulty levels. You eventually learn to outmaneuver it, but before you do that it can feel like a Locker Simulator. Another flaw, if you want to call it that, is that while the environments are beautifully crafted you won't have much time to appreciate them due to the omnipresent Xenomorph and other enemies.  In conclusion Alien Isolation  recaptures the feeling of the originial Alien movie exceptionally well, complete with the entire station interior looking like that found on the Nostromo, from the doors to beds to the computers. The feeling of isolation and vulnerability are ever-present and you will be tip-toeing through the levels and duck under the nearest table when you hear the signature noises from the ventilation shafts. If you've never known terror in a video game, this game will change that.Rated 9/10 - This is what a survival horror should be like.;Recommended;19.0;21/06/2015;321;21

Sega;Alien: Isolation;Action;R$ 89,99;It was always going to be difficult to make a game worthy of the original Alien movie but Creative Assemby rose to the task and created an absolute classic. Not only was the game filled with tension and terror, it was filled with so much nostalgia that you almost felt like you were back watching the original movie at times. The graphics are great, although the aliasing is an issue due to the AA options not being great. The sound fits perfectly from the creepy ambient noises to the epic music. And the design of everything in the game was a true nod to the original movie. Everything looked like it had been dreamt up by someone in the 70s trying to predict what the future would look like and for old fans like me, it worked perfectly, even down to the addition of a slight film grain (which could be turned off).The game itself was terrifying, with the alien AI being brutally good at stalking you, and although there are a few places it feels too scripted, the general feeling you get is one of facing a supremely good predator who is learning your movements just as much as you are trying to learn his.The game could probably have been a little shorter and still been great, but in general I recommend this game without hesitation to any horror game fans, or any old timers who remember the original Alien movie with fondness (or terror).Here is my full video review, but be warned, it contains some spoilers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyxtFoG0bU;Recommended;30.7;1/01/2015;240;8
Sega;Alien: Isolation;Action;R$ 89,99;How To Play This Game1. Know what to expect. The trailers for this game suggested to me that you would be stuck on a ship with the alien and have to play smart and stealthily and it'd be around 8 hours long. I do not like to spoil myself by reading reviews and previews so I didn't know that most of this game is spent on an enormous space-station and I took 25 hours to beat this game. It's not built like an indie survival-horror title like I thought it would be, but instead like a triple-A title, for better and for worse. I would have liked a more well-paced game with a satisfying intro, climax, and conclusion, and not the drawn-out marathon we got instead, but that said, this game can be enjoyed as long as you know that and adjust accordingly.2. Soak in the game's atmosphere. Read everything, look at everything, and loot everything you can. The sound and music work is astounding and adds to the tension and fear rather than takes away from it like in Resident Evil 4. In RE4, whenever an enemy or enemies spawned somewhere in the vicinity, the same music would play until it or they all died. Thus, when there was no music playing, you knew you were safe. However, in A:I, the same effect kind of happens, but the Alien can pop up at any time with no warning, and only then the music will slowly ramp up and get louder the closer it gets to you. The same philosophy from RE4 is kind of there but it is far more subtle and dynamic. Great job Creative Assembly.3. Take your time. One of the reasons why IGN and Gamespot found this game frustrating is because reviewers only have a limited time-window in which they can complete and review a game.Your goal while playing this game should not be to 'beat it' but to enjoy it. If the game is frustrating you, stop playing it, and come back to it later. You will try new ways to get past an area, and be more level-headed. 'Professional' reviewers don't necessarily have this luxury because they're on a time-crunch. give them some slack.If you make 'beating' the game your goal, you will not enjoy it because it's very long for the type of game it is, and the game keeps pulling the carrot-on-a-stick further back each time you think you can bite it.4. Temper your expectations. Although this game looks very realistic and as believable as future space can be, it's still a videogame. The AI is still handled in a traditional way with set paths, with the twist of randomization thrown in. The Alien won't exactly behave like the Alien in the movie(s). It may throw you off and break you out of your immersive bubble when you see the Alien patrolling on its hind legs like a human, and run around desks when it should be jumping on top of the desk and coming straight for you. Just realize that is hard to program and give the developers some slack.5. Don't be too conservative when crafting. The game is fairly generous with crafting materials. Save before you go to a difficult area, try a different strategy, and if it doesn't work, reload your save and try something else. Be patient, and have fun coming up with new strategies.As a summation, enjoy the game, soak it all in, take your time, and embrace the challenge. This game was designed to be challenging, even on Easy. Instead of getting frustrated, open your mind, think differently, and use the tools the developers have given you to achieve your goal.Thank you for reading, and have a great day.;Recommended;31.8;28/10/2014;216;3

Konami;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain;Action, Adventure;R$ 99,00;INTRODUCTIONLet me start off by saying this game is unfinished, a large chunk of the game is missing that contains the originally planned ending and the entire second half of the game is filled with the same exact missions from the first half but with increased difficulty. That's a lot to take at once, now you might ask yourself, what makes it worth buying?Well, even in this state, the game is a lot of fun to play, having probably THE BEST stealth open world gameplay ever made, you can approach missions in any way you want, either stealth or guns blazing, either call a helicopter for support or snipe from afar, either send your companion in or go in a vehicle or tank, anything is possible in terms of gameplay. STORY The main story isn't the greatest ever made, especially if you judge it as an MGS game but it has some preety cool high points made incredible by the 80s soundtrack with tracks like "The Man who Sold the World" by David Bowie and others by great artists like the Oscar winning Ennio Morricone or Donna Burke.Don't come into this expecting long cutscenes like in MGS 4, the cutscenes are kept to a minimum, apart from a short intro to each mission you just get thrown into the game and you decide how you play. The characters are great and very well voice acted but there's a lack of character development, at least for the side characters.What I found dissapointing was the second half of the game, you can feel the production had to be stopped and missions had to be re-used after Kojima got layed off. This is a terrible decision on Konami's part but thankfully the overall feel of the game wasn't affected. The biggest thing that's missing is a true ending to the game, there's footage of the ending that we were supposed to get on Youtube but instead we get an ok but not great ending, leaving lots of plot-holes and feel that the game isn't finished. SOUNDS/SOUNDTRACK The soundtrack is some of the best 80s songs you'll ever hear, it won the award for best soundtrack at TGS 2015 but sadly Konami (the publishers of the game) didn't allow the creator of the game, Hideo Kojima, the right to participate the award show and pick up the prize. If you love 80s music, you'll love the soundtrack for this game.A taste of the incredible soundtrack:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrkzIN2eP0UThe ambient sounds, even tho not the best, are used preety well to create the feel of a big open world and for the most part work preety well even tho there is certainly room for improvement. GAMEPLAY As said before, the gameplay is the best stealth open world gameplay ever created, allowing you complete freedom in the way you approach the given situation, the controls are sharp and responsive on both keyboard and mouse and controller. You have a huge variety of guns and customization options numbering in the hundreds as well as a number of companions like D-dog or Quiet who give you a tactical advantage in the field.The side missions are high in number but not that much in quality, some of them are really good and feature main characters and cutscenes while the most (around 80%) are repetitive side quests like "Destroy X number of tanks" or "Take out the 2 guards at that location". GRAPHICS & OPTIMISATION The graphics look good, especially the lightning and reflections look preety realistic, altho you might find some textures lacking since this game also came out on the previous generation of consoles, as well as the foliage not looking that great and lacking Ambient Occlusion.The optimisation is  INCREDIBLE . Yea, I had to write that in caps. You can run this on litteraly anything, even a potato plugged to any screen could produce playable framerates. As long as your graphics card supports DX11 (any card from 2010 and later) you will run this game. ONLINE The online mode is ok, not great. It suffers from lots of connection issues, lag and of course, microtransactions (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Konami). This is definitely not the main part of the game and you'll mainly be spending your time in the singleplayer. LENGTH It took me roughly 55 hrs to finish the game, doing mainly the story missions with quite a few side quests. I had the overall game completion around 60%. I have no doubt that if you want to reach perfect score for all the missions and complete every single side quest on the map you'll put at least 100 hours into this game. CONCLUSION A good final chapter to this series, even tho dissapointing in some aspects, MGS 5 manages to stay fun through it's incredible gameplay and have preety high replay value. The game is unfinished, the story isn't complete, we're missing the true ending that was supposed to be made, but with the current price it's still a very enjoyable experience.GRAPHICS: 9/10SOUND: 8/10SOUNDTRACK: 10/10GAMEPLAY: 10/10STORY: 6/10ONLINE: 5/10OVERALL: 8/10;Recommended;56.3;26/05/2016;198;11

Konami;eFootball PES 2021;Sports;None;I don't play online, just Master League: no matter which difficulty level you choose, it's just impossible to play because the game decides for you. It compensates all the time. Do you just spent your club money buying Messi? Oh, don't worry: he will never be able to dribble an unknown defender from a Serie B unknown club. But if he can and he shoots, said shot will never end up into goal: it will hit a post, the goalkeeper, even your own teammates, or maybe just goes 70 degress off from wherever you aim, but it will never be a goal. Next match is against Manchester United? You can win 5-0 easily.Besides, each update changes something for worse. The last one (i don't know names, just around end of May 2021) just changes ball physics and the way players receive passes (among other things). Now it bounces all the time, even if it's raining. If player is able to receive the ball wit its chest, he will make THE IMPOSSIBLE to receive it with his leg raised at mid height and make ball incontrolable. Oh, and now your players won't jum and/or use their heads for any reason (don't worry: neither rival players). I don't know why, maybe they are just tired. Pandemic, maybe (?).PES simulation was always better than FIFA's, but seems like Konami wants:A) To be like FIFA, even at their worst features.B) To destroy this game to make room for PES 2022... or eFootball 2022, of Banana Soccer 2022, or whatever stupid name MKT team decides is better... because they are decided to destroy everything: a brand, an earned reputation, a healthy community of football players, you name it.I've been playing football simulators my entire life. This is probably my last one. I don't care about competition licences, real club names, if you can see acne on players' faces, whatever. I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to play in a simple simulator that respects players and the most beautiful sport in the world. See how many hours I've gave to this game...

Konami;Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 72,99;I'm three years late with this review. Pros: First off, thank God, the sequel's more keyboard-friendly than LoS1. Remember the forced Stone Idol Titan “twirl-left-stick” QTE in the first game that had dumbfounded pretty much everyone who could not afford a controller? Well, now you can turn that sucker off, granting Gabriel the power to auto-succeed all QTEs at the expense of some experience points.  The LoS1 skill page has become a skill tree. it's easier to browse and see what skills lead to which. Still, the game funnily “reimburses” you should you go for a NG+. Mildly annoying, but it does show you just how much experience you've accumulated.  The combat flows more freely if compared to LoS1 and the Somersault move no longer makes you feel like you've cement blocks around your ankles. (Yes, I like Somersault.) Unlike other games I've played (namely Alice: Madness Returns), you get a clear visual/audio indication that your attack did not hit/did no damage. The new Weapon Mastery system gives you an incentive to vary your combos.   The character design, the bosses, the voice acting, and the OST. Holy hell, A+. Play the game just for these. The Toy Maker and Inner Dracula deserve special mention. Unbound camera! Finally some use for your mouse/right stick.  The atmosphere is amazing, especially if you stop to sightsee.  The story is engrossing, and it ramps up the stakes in the last ten minutes, too.  Purely IMO here, but I do think Gabriel's one of the finest examples of good video game writing. His depiction of Dracula is nuanced and endearing. Same goes for Alucard, really. Cons: Forced stealth is meh. It's not that particularly hard, mind. the enemies you're expected to slip past are brain-dead. They don't look up, don't ring the alarm at the sight of bats in a pharmaceutical corporation, and blame mosquitoes when you fling a dagger at them. The only exception to this is Agreus, but his AI is just as exploitable. Psst, ignore the bells, wait till he rushes you and Mist Form away. The Xbox prompts stay even if you do not have a controller plugged in. Again, a mild annoyance that very nearly got me killed when the game had asked me to "press B" or "down on the D-Pad".  The cheap hitscan potshots enemies like to take at you when you're out of range (or just performing an aerial combo for too long). Soldiers chuck daggers, heavies chuck axes, demons spit, vampires, uhhh, scream (?)... you get the picture. It becomes infuriating if you're backtracking for collectibles and do not wish to engage them. Of course, you can reciprocate with a Void Projectile/Bat Swarm and be on your merry way, but still. Typical padding.Ultimately, in spite of its flaws and troubled development, it's a good game and is worthy its purchase price. I've already beaten it twice. Too bad it was unjustly panned by critics at its release.;Recommended;82.5;24/06/2017;77;1
Konami;Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 72,99;Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 continues the story of Gabriel Belmont and his transformation into the dark lord. Dracula.Upon starting the game you'll immediately be plunged into an epic battle as Dracula's castle is besieged by the Brotherhood of Light. During this time you'll be trained in the art of combat, mastering Dracula's three weapons as well as evasive maneuvers. The weapons vary and each of them fill a specialized role. After the initial opening, you'll be unleashed into an open world with two dimensions to travel between, Dracula's Castle and a modern Gothic city built upon its ruins. The art direction and audio is phenomenal, featuring an amazing cast of voice actors. Robert Carlyle, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Jason Isaacs to name a few. The soundtrack is also really well done, fitting the mood of the game flawlessly. The environments are absolutely beautiful, allowing plenty of room for exploration while searching for the various upgrades, lore and abilities.The story, when combined with the previous two entries is engaging and helps propel you through the 15 hour game, although the ending is a bit abrupt as well as disappointing. Veterans of the Hack n' Slash genre will want to begin on the harder difficulty as it's a bit simple when compared to games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. Between, fighting, exploring, puzzle solving, and platforming there's a lot of fun to be had.While the stealth segments seem to be a major complaint for a lot of reviewers, they don’t detract from the overall game. I’ll admit that I was skeptical at first since stealth really has no business being in a Castlevania title, but they play out similarly to puzzles opposed to traditional stealth missions. They’re also few and far between.The menu system is highly polished and will document every type of creature you fight against. It also acts to manage your upgrades and abilities as you level. Plenty of Lore and backstory is provided along the way from diaries as well.While it'd be nice to have a triple A classic Symphony of the Night experience, LoS2 is great in its own way and playing as “The Dragon” with this new take on the legend is a blast. Don’t believe some of the critics, Lords of Shadow 2 is a must-play.For a longer and more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and I put together:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUW5McQYaCEPros:+ Excellent Art Direction+ Great Soundtrack+ All-star Voice Acting+ Balanced Gameplay+ Large open world to exploreCons:- Dracula doesn’t feel evil enough- Disappointing FinaleIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/;Recommended;17.6;7/03/2014;153;1
Konami;Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 72,99;It usually happens I find myself torn between a diamond in the rough and problematic technical or some other aspect of the game, but with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 it's somewhat different. Time to see if I can put into somewhat coherent paragraph or two as to why that's the case.Let's start off by saying I was one of the people who enjoyed the original Lords of Shadow for what it was – not necessarily a creatively original masterpiece, but a game of astounding production values, competent writing and tight narrative punctuated by stellar voice work and lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it was a very meaty game which lead to some even saying it was too long for its own good. Fast forward to sequel and you can see it basically falters in each of these categories.Interestingly enough game seems to swing between two polar opposites with its visuals because on one hand you have this classic Castlevania look comprised of foreboding yet mystical gothic castle to romp through, as well as its assorted menagerie of beasties to but heads with and solve painfully few puzzles compared to the first game, but on the other you have to contend with extremely bland modern-day warehouses and science laboratories ad nauseam alongside some fairly uninspired enemies ranging from more classical demons and Satanists to, what really should've been more interesting that ended up, futuristic soldiers and cybernetic abominations roaming the streets. But honestly, it's this weird disjointed narrative that undoes the game the most in my mind because you can clearly tell there was meant to be more there instead of just going from A to B and meandering in-between retreading locations with nothing but brief radio contacts from time to time. And lastly – game is simply short compared to the first one and that probably ties into my previous point. Rumors abound regarding game's troubled development were apparently well founded. That's not to say game is bad because, as you will have most likely noticed despite my continued rambling on regarding its negatives, this is marked as a positive review overall. It's still Lords of Shadow and if you liked the original you'll probably like this considering you can overlook its weak story. Gameplay feels familiar and skippable QTEs are god-sent, both of which are points in game's favor for me, not to mention combat and item system was expanded and enemy variety despite their designs actually means you'll end up facing quite a bit of different behaviors. Story establishes the mood very early on as one of Dracula's somber and more resigned journey, one profoundly personal despite all other events that unfold over the course of the game. Had it been properly fleshed out and Robert Carlyle's more subdued performance given time to develop, occasional hamfisted melodrama notwithstanding, it would've been a much, much better final product. I also heard some nay saying about mandatory stealth sections in the game to which I say it's about time to drop hand-holding. Barring for one section involving leaves and crazed Satyr these were a welcome diversion for me and fitting considering MC's condition story-wise.One last caveat I feel should be posted is that playing the original game and Mirror of Fate is recommended before tackling the sequel.;Recommended;14.8;28/07/2015;59;2
Konami;Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 72,99;"I was their most devoted warrior. A Champion of Light. But I fell. Fell into darkness, and now... I am feared as The Prince of Darkness. Ironic, don't you think?"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a third-person action-adventure game and the final entry in the Lords of Shadow series. You control Gabriel Belmont, who is now known as Dracula, and your main weapon is the Shadow Whip, which is very similar to the Combat Cross from past games. To fully understand Gabriel’s story and how he turned into Dracula, I highly recommend playing the first game before this one, and that you will be seeing familiar characters.Pros✔️ Very good story with interesting side characters and well-made cutscenes.✔️ Gabriel, the main protagonist, is interesting and likable.✔️ Improved combat with more weapons and abilities to choose from.✔♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥moving camera.✔️ Challenging enemies and excellent boss fights.✔️ The graphics look absolutely stunning.✔️ Character models and facial expressions are improved and look great.✔️ The game is well optimized.✔️ Great soundtrack. Cons❌ Tedious stealth sections.❌ Some pointless puzzles.❌ Kill animations take too long and get repetitive.❌ Some areas feel linear and claustrophobic.StoryLike in the first game, you control Gabriel - now known as Dracula, the Prince of Darkness -  and you wake up from a deep sleep, centuries later in your cathedral, which is located in present day Metropolis. You found out that Satan is returning to Earth and it is up to you, with the help of your former enemy Zobek (voiced by Sir Patrick Stewart), to stop and destroy him once and for all. It starts off with an excellent tutorial sequence and a very well-made intro that explains the events of the previous two games. The cutscenes are well directed and just fun to watch (with few awkward scenes here and there), and I enjoyed the banter between Gabriel and other characters. In the previous game, all the characters are interesting, mysterious and intriguing, and you will meet familiar ones from past games. Gabriel is more fleshed out and is very likable, as the story focuses more on him and his family. Overall, the story is far better in the previous games, with well-made cutscenes and very good plot twists that I didn’t see coming, and it kept me invested until the end. GameplayCombatBeing Dracula now, your main weapon is the Shadow Whip, and it is pretty much the same as the Combat Cross so I felt right at home. The combat is more fast-paced and feels a lot smoother, you can now dash and leap during fights with more ease and greater accuracy, and you can drain the blood of your enemies to heal. Kill animations are back and they are varied from one enemy to another, but some take too long to finish and can get repetitive after a while. Instead of the medallions from the first game, two new weapons are added to your arsenal. the Void Sword that replenishes your health when attacking enemies and can freeze them for a short period of time, and Chaos Claws that inflict more damage and can break certain armors and shields. Both weapons have their own combos and abilities that you can unlock using points that you earn from killing enemies. StealthProbably the worst feature in the game. You will be doing some tedious stealth missions throughout the story, and hiding from certain security guards. Those stealth sections feel so out of place, since you, the almighty "Prince of Darkness", aren't able to kill those security guards even in the late game, but they can easily kill you with one or two hits.Enemies & BossesThe enemies are diverse and challenging, even on normal difficulty, and you can sometimes see them fight each other in some parts of the world. Bosses aren't as frequent as in the first game, but they are epic and feel more cinematic, a huge step up from the previous games.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2129747647PuzzlesThe puzzles are easy and less frequent, since the main focus is on combat and exploration. However, most of them, especially the stealth puzzles, feel unnecessary and a chore to go through. It is baffling to see Dracula defeating monsters twice his size, but struggling with locked doors or not able to go to the next floor of a building without doing certain puzzles.DifficultyI played on the Lords of Shadow (Hard) difficulty. the enemies and bosses are tougher and deal more damage but remain fair and balanced, as you will be using your abilities, weapons and combos that you learn to slay them and progress through the game.Other Changes🌟 Free-moving camera is used instead of the fixed camera like in the previous games, and it is a great change, since it enhances the exploration and combat.🌟 Platforming is better and faster-paced, as Gabriel moves much faster now.🌟 QTEs are back, but you can disable them in the game's settings and continue playing the game without them.🌟 Soldier’s scrolls are back but are called diaries and memorials instead. They only offer more lore of the world and the Belmonts instead of hints to solve certain puzzles.🌟 The game constantly gives you hints (sometimes not even related to the gameplay, such as how to view artwork), so I recommend turning it off in the menu immediately.🌟 There’s New Game+, and you can still keep playing the game even after defeating the final boss to improve and fully upgrade your abilities, if you want.Graphics and Level DesignThe game looks beautiful. the character models and their facial expressions look more alive and detailed. The lighting is great, and some of the areas nailed it with the game's gothic atmosphere. However, the world is less vibrant and some areas feel narrow and claustrophobic, as you are almost always surrounded by buildings and walls. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2146572129Contrary to the previous game, this one has no chapters or levels anymore. it is just one big non-linear open world with no loading screens during gameplay. There are a lot of secrets and upgrades to your abilities for you to find in this world, so keep your eyes peeled. Technical Laptop: Omen HP 17tGTX 1070Intel Core I7-7700HQ 2.80 Ghz16 GB RAMWindows 10 Home 64-bitThe game worked well and ran beautifully. No issues to report.SoundtrackThe game has an orchestral and more cinematic style of music, compared to the previous ones. from a dark tone that represents the tragic Dracula’s origin story, to epic music during boss fights that make those battles more memorable and cinematic. The composer, Oscar Araujo, did a fantastic job with the game’s soundtrack, while sticking with the style and tone of the previous two games.Additional DetailsTotal playtime12 hours (without DLC)Recommended difficultyLords of Shadow (Hard)M&K or ControllerBoth work but a controller is preferableOffline modeYesAchievementsYes, and they can be toughTrading cardsNoneGames SavingAutomaticallyFinal ThoughtsI enjoyed playing Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 and had a lot of fun slaying enemies, but the new stealth sections, pointless puzzles and some dull locations held the game back for me.

I loved first Castlevania, but this, this is much better game, in my opinion. I bought it on one winter sale, left it in my backlog and then....well completely forgot about it....2 years later, i finally install and played it.Darker tone on story, good level design and solid performance from actors and also fantastic combat in combination with some stealth moments (yes, some would say there is no place for stealth in this genre, but i find it rather amousing) made this game a fantastic expirience for me. A lot of stuff to explore, great implementation of metroidvania style in, let's say, real world enviroment were a nice little surprise.

Most are OFF by default, and if it's your first time playing, you're probably going to want/need to adjust them.Story:14th Century France.  Step into one of the darkest times in history, when The Black Plague swept across Europe leaving 25 million people dead in its wake.  We play as Amicia de Rune, a high-spirited young noblewoman with a rich imagination and a longing for adventure.  A peaceful day out with her father is soon shattered by a voracious entity in the woods, and her world is then turned upside down as her home is invaded by soldiers.  Now she and her 5-year-old brother, Hugo, are on the run, and the newly-erupted sickness all around them seems to be the least of their worries...https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852326073There are historically-accurate items peppered throughout the game, but this is not a historic account by any means. What A Plague Tale gives us is a world of the arcane, filled with terror and the unexplainable.  Only once do we actually see the disease up close and personal, and this allows us some degree of detachment from the horrible reality of the suffering all around us.  There are some incredibly gruesome visuals in the game, to be sure, but I can't really give any additional details without spoilers. Cutscenes can be skipped by holding down the appropriate button (on my Xbox 360 controller it was the B button) -- useful when you die right after a long dialogue.Gameplay:There are three types of collectibles to keep an eye out for during the game.  Although I am usually a big fan of hidden content, this tale is so compelling that I didn't want to break the immersion by running around just to find the extras.  They DO expand upon the story and overall feeling of the time frame, but I chose to focus on the story for my first playthrough.  Luckily, you can easily go back to get items or achievements that you missed via the Chapter Selection button on the main menu.  Not only that, but when you use this function, it shows your collectible status for each chapter!  Nice!Early on you're mostly running, sneaking and occasionally using your slingshot.  Just when I was thinking that was all there was to the gameplay, everything changed.  Now there were puzzles, different kinds of ammo, less running and more overall finesse, adding an extra layer of depth to everything we needed to do. The game is not without its flaws.  There is no map, nor indicator of which way you should be going, and although it doesn't happen often, this can result in getting turned about and heading the wrong way.  I did find some collectibles that I'd missed when I had originally passed through, so at least there was a plus to getting lost. lol~At times we need to move around carts or large boxes, and the movement was very hard to get used to for me.  Pro tip: When moving large items, push or pull ONLY, and adjust the CAMERA to change directions!https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852898291Battles:They have armor, shields and mighty weapons to crush, impale and otherwise snuff out your life in an instant.  You have a slingshot. I'm sure that you can see a bit of an imbalance here, but there is much more to combat than it seems at first glance, and you do have the ability to dodge (not covered in the tutorial, by the way.)I mentioned earlier that you will end up with different kinds of ammo, and you'll sometimes have to switch between them quickly in order to take out your enemies.  This can be nerve-wracking, so learning what each type does before you go into battle is going to be a huge help to you.Ammo concoctions can: Light firesDouse firesCause burning pain that forces enemies to remove their helmetsKnock enemies out for a non-lethal killThese are only a few of the possibilities, but telling you more would entail spoilers.  I'm sure that you can see the possibilities here, but there's another layer to your battles, and that is stealth and wit.  Planning out your moves, distraction techniques and of course getting your enemies off by themselves are all going to be beneficial to your health. .)I believe that there is a fail-safe built into the game to make it impossible for you to be without what you need to continue, but it can't hurt to grab every single ingredient that you can get your hands on - you'll need them for your ammo, and crafting whilst running for your life is beyond stressful!Speaking of which, I'm not going to lie -- The battles start out easy, but they become brutal fights for survival later in the game.  I actually got to one battle that was so furiously difficult that I had to turn off the game for a while.  In retrospect it's because I was making things WAY harder than they needed to be by not utilizing my tools to the best of their ability, as well as something else which I didn't realize at the time, but can't mention because it's a BIG spoiler.  Going back and replaying one of the harder battles only took me two tries instead of over a dozen, so tactics can make a huge impact! Luckily, there are multiple save points in a battle, saving me from literally pulling out my hair and from having a stroke from a blood pressure spike! lol~ I have to say that Aim-assist was my best friend in this game - I don't know if I could have completed the game without it!Sights and Sounds:The music that plays whilst the game is loading is a testament of things to come. to the epic journey you are about to embark upon.  Every aspect of the game is the same quality as that intro music: beautiful and haunting and of the highest production values.  The voice acting is superb, as is every sound effect, sigh of the wind and musical note that you will hear. The visuals are absolutely stunning, completely enveloping you in this terrible but beautiful world of strife, pain and love.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852955060I was overjoyed to learn that there is an in-game Photo Mode, which allows you to pause, move the camera around, get the very best angle and snap amazing shots to your heart's content. Extras:Codex - All collectibles that you have foundAbility to change the family Coat of Arms (if you have that DLC)Epilogue35 Steam AchievementsThe Epilogue is very short.  There are no collectibles, but it does give us just a little bit of extra closure.  Although I don't want to wish any more misfortune on our characters, this game was so amazing that I'd love to find out that a second game is in the works. ♥Verdict:A Plague Tale: Innocence has the most compelling, the most riveting story that I've ever experienced in a game.  It's not just the writing... It's also the environmental graphics, the voice overs and the gameplay, all merging into a world that feels tangible and alive!  Buy it now, play it NOW...

Variations of items that you can use with your sling, for different opponents and the ability to eliminate them differently each time, I really-really liked.Ruined fortresses, temples, villages — all this is done so believably that you quickly begin to believe in the world of A Plague Tale: Innocence.

Focus Home Interactive;A Plague Tale: Innocence;Action, Adventure;R$ 239,90;A mesmerizing soundtrack which sets you into the atmosphere of the game. A masterfully crafted and coherent plot with emotional moments. They say a product is as good as its weakest link but it really is a consistent game in terms of pacing and gameplay. You won't find filler quests as in many sandbox games today, you are in for a linear, tight and focused story with gameplay elements being introduced as the plot develops without them being too overwhelming and adding diversity to the gameplay. It also benefits from a phenomenal art direction.The two main characters Amicia and Hugo  as well as Beatrice are well developed, albeit I feel that the rest aren't as much and they are way too stereotypical, only serving as a means to advance the story, without any tribulations or motivations other than their cookie cutter traits. I've experienced flickering in some textures while rotating the camera fast, I don't know if it's a generalized issue or one with my hardware settings but it got quite distracting at times. I thought the game would've benefitted from a bit more realism in combat, had the sling been more unreliable as a weapon and used as a last resort, but this is nitpicking on my behalf. In my humble opinion, I consider it to be a superb game and I would therefore encourage anyone willing to give it a try.;Recommended;12.0;22/12/2019;146;3

Focus Home Interactive;A Plague Tale: Innocence;Action, Adventure;R$ 239,90;This is a fantastic movie-like experience in which the player takes the role of Amicia de Rune, a girl whose parents were killed and the only family left is her sick brother. On the run from the inquisition, chased by soldiers, rats and time, she's doing whatever it takes to survive.It's a typical linear game with a single path ahead, no choices, no alternate ways. The gameplay is pretty simple and besides some crafting and material collecting, it might be called a "walking simulator". That's not bad at all, I love such games. One of the main gameplay elements is stealth as Amicia is forced to stay out of sight often. Here come the bad things which  kinda ruining the experience for me - enemies are completely dumb, I'd even say brainwashed. Their vision is horrible and reactions to actions caused by Amicia just plain stupid. For example, Amicia can throw stones around them and they don't hear a thing until the stone hits their head directly. Also, they completely ignore her brother shouting "Amicia, I'm scared! across the whole field. This is the major downside of the game but besided that, I can say nothing but good things, so let's go to them.Graphics is gorgeous, some of the textures are not the best but reflections, level design and the overall look and feel is amazing. I press F12 for screenshots so often that my screenshot library is already full of beautiful sceneries.The story is definitely above the average, highly enjoyable, easy to follow and simply said - amazing.Main characters have personalities and souls, not annoying and stupid at all (inspire yourself, Wolfenstein Youngblood!), Amicia is fun to play as.The overall setting is dark, the game is brutal and includes disturbing scenes, IMO should be avoided by children. I appreciate the realistic and honest way of representation of such a dark age, it helps the immersion and atmosphere.I also recommend playing with French voices as it helps the atmosphere. I didn't understand a thing but subtitles help.

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;*** DISCLAIMER: This game is NOT for everybody, even though I'm loving it, A LOT. And that's because it is a little slower than most games. it revolves around a huge social mechanic that I mention below. ***My thoughts so far:Well, I'm absolutely loving the game, and apparently I didn't get to the awesome parts where the game really picks up. This new innovative mechanic they added in is just awesome, and I've never seen it done in an RPG before. The whole game is all about choices, and it has me going through many dilemmas. Drinking blood is highly desirable as it gives you a MASSIVE amount of xp, granted you can earn xp in other ways, but drinking someone's blood will give you A LOT more. Now, the interesting part about this is that as you learn more about a person (and in turn, the world you're living in, and the lore of the game) the more xp you get from someone's blood. Here's the issue: Let's say you meet a person you don't particularly like. you're like: "okay, i don't like this guy anyways, I'm going to want to kill him. Let's learn more about him so we can earn more xp when we drink his blood eventually." Simple, right? WELL, as you learn more about a person you might've disliked at first, you might end up actually liking them. It's like what happened with Dwight in The Office as he studied Andy. So it's like, "well damn it. Now I have this huge dilemma. Do i want this delicious 4000xp I can get in 2 seconds? I like the guy now." I found that particularly very interesting.And as you talk to people, you actually learn a lot about them, their relationships, their motives, and how they contribute to the district. How much of a loss would this district experience if I kill this fella? Does he matter to anyone? Also, do you want your districts to be in great shape? And if so, well, killing them reduces that district's health. so it's like DILEMMAS upon DILEMMAS. and when a game has me in that state and care that much about the people and the world I'm in, I consider it a great game. The way it presents the story is awesome.Now, obviously, you ARE going to be doing a LOT of talking, pretty much EVERY NPC has dialogue. SO, the voice acting HAS to be good. and THANKFULLY, so far, it's been nothing short of awesome. Super immersive and believable dialogue. so I'm glad.Graphics wise, it's okay compared to other games (minus the beard. the beard looks phenomenal lol.) BUT this post-victorian London looks aweosme, and the level design is somewhat soulsy, with shortcuts to open (doors being locked from one side) and small corridors. It is a small map, with not THAT many people. BUT every single person you see (that is sane) has a backstory, emotion, dialogue, and investigations and relationships for most.Music is AWESOME tbh, super vampire-like, and not "Vampires: Masquerade", that was a more punkish setting. In this one you feel like a high-class vampire, an intellectual one, while listening to an amazing string-based/orchestral score. Finally, combat: in it's basic form, it's okay. It mostly plays like the Witcher. BUT, with the coolass dodge animations and abilities you get, it truly makes you feel like a vampire, which is good to me. I have fun with the combat, it could get hard, especially in boss fights. So I'm good with that. I like the mechanics they introduced too. Different types of attacks (blood, shadow, physical, stun) with enemies having different resistances is always a good sign for an RPG.TLDR. this is an RPG. you talk to people and make very meaningful (hard-ass dilemma-inducing head-scratching "yeah I'll just sleep on it") choices.P.S. I WILL update this as I progress through the game. I know that the story has a lot to offer as well, and I haven't done a lot of that yet.EDIT: I'm almost 20 hours in, and not even halfway done, but perhaps that's just me taking my time with the game.So what I've come across that I've found most interesting are the sidequests, or "investigations." They are very indepth and allow you to make choices that affect the world around you, sometimes on a significant level, sometimes on a personal level. However, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are these choices hard. The choices aren't white or black, e.g. blow up megaton or not.No. The most recent choice I've come across seriously had me quitting the game to sleep on it. I'm seriously conflicted, and have no idea what to do. I even texted some friends as to what they would do in a situation like this. I'll give you a little insight into one of the choices I've come across, if you don't want the nature of the dilemma spoiled, then please read no further.MILD SPOILERS: *********************************OK, so I met this dude, and he was a ♥♥♥♥. part of a gang, who extorts some people in town for money, especially this merchant who used to be his best friend. I was like, okay, this guy's a ♥♥♥♥, I might as well suck on his blood later. I walk around that town and knock on a door, and an ill kid opens the door, turns out that it was that "bad guy"'s son who is kind of sick and depressed, and his father is trying to everything he can to help him, he loves him a lot, the one thing he cares about in this world. I also snooped around the house a little to find a rejection letter from the job the father was trying to apply to, so HE IS TRYING, but he has no choice since they wouldn't hire him because they know he's part of a gang. Also, his wife is dead.Here's the tricky part: while i was exploring out in the world, i found a box. And in that box was an unread note from his deceased wife to his best friend. WELL, turns out his former best friend and his deceased wife have been having an affair a long time ago, AND, WELL, that ill kid might be that dude's son instead (which I think is the case.) SO... now I have the option to either give the note to the widowed husband, or to his best friend... How do you deal with knowing that your dead wife had an affair with your best friend? That the son you're trying to do everything in your power to help might not be your son? Is he just going to go and kill the merchant? At the same time, damn, I want him to know, I hate cheaters.****************************END OF SPOILERthat had me pulling my hair out trying to decide what to do. I just ended up quitting the game and going to bed to sleep on it. That is just one example of so many morally grey choices you have to make in the game aside from sparing/taking people's lives.;Recommended;27.6;4/06/2018;699;15
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;For the most part, this game is great. Great storytelling and interesting characters, and a lot of morality-based decisions that have a real impact on how the game plays out and really forces the player to consider their actions carefully. Do you kill a confessed murderer who is the only one supporting his elderly mother, who in turn is the only one raising an orphaned teenager? There are tons of decisions like these throughout the game, and maintaining a no-kill playthrough is decidedly hard as a result.However, the game also allows you to play it without killing fairly well. In my no-kill playthrough, I didn't feel like I was at a huge disadvantage for not killing any civilians, but the game is balanced well enough that it quickly becomes clear that you would be much, much stronger if you did. It's a unique approach that makes killing a civilian with a hefty amount of XP attached to them very tempting, without feeling like you're shooting yourself in the foot if you never embrace anyone.The combat is nothing new, but is still fun, if not somewhat repetitive. Your abilities do make you feel like you're a vampire, but you have to learn to love dodging constantly. That said, when compared to other games with similar combat, this feels much clunkier. The main problems are pretty much technical ones, such as the absolutely insane decision to have mouse movement tied to switching targets when you have one locked. The tiniest flinch of your wrist makes Dr. Reid flail around, stabbing the air towards an enemy while the one you were actually trying to hit whacks you from the side. What makes it worse is that this is one of the only control aspects you can't remap. The autosave system is downright hubristic on part of the developers as well, and it is definitely the most frustrating aspect of the game for me. Not only does it mean that you have to completely replay the game if you want to try one thing slightly differently, but it assumes that things like bugged quests don't exist, and unfortunately I have definitely run into a couple. Thankfully, since this is on PC, you can find the files yourself and start backing them up, which I definitely recommend. Overall though, the story, setting, and characters are enough to make me accept the technical problems with the game, but it does make me wish that certain things had been more polished. tl.dr - It's a good game, but it could have been a GREAT game if it was just a little more polished and certain aspects had been thought through more.;Recommended;183.4;2/06/2020;142;1
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;Obviously, this game is a 'hit or miss' for many - but for me, it caters to everything I could possibly want from a vampire RPG, and more. The combat is especially creative, with unique skill trees that highlight your abilities as both a vampire, and a doctor. depending on the trees you decide to build. You can claw out throats, replenish your stamina through combative biting, craft medicines that heal, and poisons that kill. The combat mechanics stay fairly true to the abilities' descriptions - and hitting combos is a treat. There's just something about upper-cutting an enemy and launching them into the air with vampiric talons, while slow-motion blood sprays out of their gaping wounds, that just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Combat aside, the gameplay itself is heavily centered on story and investigative quests, which is another perk for me. I adore investigating, hunting trails, and piecing together clues. Vampyr's investigative features are much like Geralt's in The Witcher: you have your "vampire senses" which turn the world around you monochrome, and hyperfocus on scents, blood trails, and more. You can heal districts by helping people with their ailments, or you can let them fall to the inevitable horrors of an untreated pandemic. You have the choice to be brutal, or virtuous. and every decision has an impact on your journey, and its outcome.Some honorable mentions...Hauntingly gorgeous soundtrack. Rich, dark atmosphere that emulates the eerie, foggy streets of a plague-ridden city, further exemplified by cinematic graphics. Characters with unique personalities, traits, quirks, and secrets that make the world and its setting realistic, immersive, and abundantly explorative. And, of course, my favorite part: low on blood? Just grab a few rats and start snackin'. They're low-calorie, and free!Overall, this game is insanely beautiful, with a gripping story, ongoing air of mystery, creepy and curious codexes and letters sprinkled throughout side quests and the main story, and an impressive amount of versatility for a niche production. I personally could not turn it off, I was so enthralled. I spent hours reading both positive and negative reviews before deciding to buy it, and I'm so glad that I didn't let the negativity keep me away from this absolute gem. For the record, I've had zero issues with camera sensitivity, or "clunky" mechanics. So far, everything runs smooth as butter.If you're looking for all the things I've found in this game, you won't regret giving it a chance.;Recommended;29.5;28/06/2020;215;5

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;Vampyr ReviewFirst ImpressionVampyr is an RPG open-world game in which every choice matters. The moral dilemmas presented in this title are fascinating as they affect the experience on all fronts. When being the good guy becomes a handicap, players are tempted to feast to make things fairer. The duality between doctor and vampire is very thin in a world where the difficulty is tied to the actions you take in-game, and your choices have consequences that can affect your entire run. Will the thirst consume you?ProsCons Player decision shapes the world! Great voice acting highlights story. Moral dilemmas are well-done! Consequences affect whole runs. The soundtrack is phenomenal! Combat can be clunky. No fast travel available. Crashes and glitches. Hard to find items downplays them.Issues from launch still persist. A Famished Hunter Cannot go on for LongVampyr is a game in which I found it very appealing to doubt my choices always, and this is because it is only auto-save, and your actions shape the world that surrounds you. If you do not feast on citizens, you will remain weak while enemies become more vigorous, giving you an extreme handicap. If you consume the blood on the inhabitants, your growth exponentially stronger, speeding progression and unlocking new abilities. The moral dilemma shines through the whole journey, as you might feel your hand being forced by the thirst to be able to defeat the beast and guards that patrol London.During my run, I consumed a lot of people, and I became powerful because of it. I did not fully commit to this idea until past halfway in the game, but after some runs, I realize that I needed some serious upgrades. I at least drained half the cast from their blood, and this was not my intention at first, but powerful enemies can incentivize you to do it! It was entertaining to see the world change because of it, as areas became more dangerous to traverse, and monsters started to mutate more frequently.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2182669104The Combat is excellent but can be clunky sometimes, especially when you are not locking on a target, I would notice how the character would attack or move in ways that I did not want to. Making lock-on more of a prominent feature than an option it can take some liberty out of it. Enemy design is fantastic, as facing certain groups requires either careful planning or good reflexes! From bulked beast that can tear you apart to religious zealots that can use the power of the church to burn and stun you! Besides, their designs are well-done! Boss battles are a bit dull at first but quickly become interesting, having multiple patterns and short windows of opportunity to inflict damage.Immortals with their Puppet Games and PlansThere are four factions in Vampyr, one of them will always be your enemy, but the other three are determinant. Depending on how you deal with them, they will affect your run, and this can range from sending special executioners after you to making everyone sick or helping you heal them. Each faction has its appeal to them, and the characters that share a sector also share the fate of it. Pillars are the leaders of said areas, and should they fall, the whole part of town will quickly decay into a critical situation.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2182667256As a player, this is where you can make your choices. Who will you ally with, which parts of the town you want to save, and which are you okay letting die? The process of healing patients is delicate in contrast to sucking their blood, but each has its distinct advantages. A healthy sector is easier to move around, can sell you essential goods, and have a base for you. Meanwhile, one that is being ravaged can be dangerous at all times and will not have vendors to acquire items. These are choices that the player must plan carefully to enhance their run, both as a doctor and a vampire. Questioning NPC's can yield more significant exp rewards, so it is recommended to get to know them. Should they be sick, they will also produce less exp in turn, so sometimes you can heal for the sake of saving them or for later consume, like planting a garden. You need the plants to be healthy before you reap them for yourself. That is an excellent design! Outstanding design! I was impressed that Vampyr ramifications extend so much over all of the titles, and it was a pleasant surprise! Strong and Weak PointsThe strong points of this game are the soundtrack and the moral dilemmas. Music can be tense and agitated when fighting a boss as you can hear the Cellos in the background while your foe tries to eliminate you. It fits the ambient of the title and further adds to those encounters! It pulled you in more into the game and was perform excellently. The moral dilemmas affecting everything, from areas to the story and the gameplay is brilliant and a new way to experiment with an RPG. They are so integrated that you can see it everywhere, and the title will tell you about it all the time too.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2182671500The weak points of Vampyr are very few, but they are huge weaknesses. For starters, there is no fast travel. In an open world RPG, there is no fast travel, and this can make it painful to move from one side of the map to the other, even though we have hideouts, we cannot move between them quickly, and I think this is a huge oversight. Granted, you can unlock shortcuts as you progress, but fast travel would have been a smarter choice. The other weakness is that there are several bugs and glitches, including ones from the launch of the title. To me, it is incredible how, after two years, issues persist and have not been addressed.X NotesIt was tested on an RTX 2070 S, during my experience as of this review, I suffered three hard crashes, all of them after sleeping, yet there was no loss of progress. One enemy and a boss got glitched and would stop attacking and moving until they were hit a couple of times. Also, a mission objective didn't display correctly until I melee like a lunatic in the area that it was supposed to be. The game suffers from technical issues a lot, but I consider it a good title at the end of the day. Bullets and other items can be hard to find, so it makes them less prominent as vials or other weapons. That's not bad, just odd, as they are not very strong until you get to the purple tier.  Finally… Vampyr is a title placated by issues from launch and some oversight in the exclusion of fast travel, but I still recommend it. The voice acting is clunky at first but develops soon after starting the game and becomes very powerful. The personalization options are interesting, and the dilemmas you will find yourself through the title are a breath of fresh air like very few games deliver. I recommend it to those that enjoy games about detectives, vampires, story-focused and open worlds. If you like this review, give it a thumbs up!

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;Manage your Expectations before you play this gamethat's the best advice i can give , it has ALOT of dialogue and most of it is important to that specific character or his buddy you want to learn about Pros:-you do really feel like a predator and everyone you meet is a potential meal -main story bosses fights are fun-a good amount of skills and "builds" you can try-replayability is off the charts in my opinion-the OST is good and seems to always fit the setting of the game-you feast you become strong you don't you become weak-graphics are great overall, not always though-game improves as you play (significantly at the ending of chapter 3 and beyond).Cons:-the fps is a mess when you unlock it and it feels janky to play on a mouse -game has 4 districts and its a mess and has no travel mode-a bit short it took me 17 hours with doing ALOT of side stuff-normal enemy mobs get annoying with time ( but they do scale with you and change with level which is good i guess)-few weapon choices specially on the first half-some builds make you weak and some break the game, i killed the boss before the final fight in 2 second with a good build even though i was 3 level behind it.Rating: 7.5/10overall had great time with the game but wouldn't recommend it at full price.;Recommended;18.2;7/06/2018;238;6
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;The strongest feature of Vampyr's gameplay is definetly the citizen system. We have the power over lives of almost every NPC. We can help them with their side-missions, cure their illnesses or we can choose to embrace them – get a big boost to our experience points by killing the individual. There is this thing tough. It won't go unnoticed. The game's world – 1918s London reacts to player's actions. It creates an intriguing power dynamic that's very distinc for this title.	The story is competent. It has some strong points but also shows some shortcuts in the writing. 	Gameplay is solid. Weapon variety is decent, skills selection allows for some decisionmaking. Combat system uses formula of managing your stamina bar with taking into account enemy attack patterns. It's slow, laggy and sometimes unreliable but I wouldn't call it bad. It's just mediocre.	Graphics are outdated. Especially in the character models and animation department. Music is interesting and helps create this gothic, dark atmosphere in the game.	This is a positive review because as a game this is a competent title. It's definetly a recommendation for the fans of vampire games but for the rest of gamers it's more like a soft reminder that this game exists, it's fine, it has some interesting ideas, maybe give it a try.

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;I first played this game back when it launched in 2018, barely thought of it again until now when I decided to play a second time. I realize now that, like most people I approached the game wrong the first time and focused in the combat and vampiric habilities which you gain troughout the game. I remember this had a certain comparasion to Dark Souls and that couldn't be further from the truth, this game is all about the story and it's many branches which will lead you to different endings. I appreciated much more this second playthrough as I focused on the story part of the game, which is by far the best, leaving the combat and the more action packed portions of the game into the background. I can honestly say I see myself returning to this depressing world once again in the future for I know there are certain things I missed about the lore. Overall, a great underrated game.;Recommended;57.7;1/03/2020;115;1
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;I'd had my eye on this game for a while, but never took the plunge. I think I was initially put off by some of the negative reviews, with some of them taking aim at the combat system and difficulty scaling. When this game appeared in a recent humble choice, I was keen to give it a go. I've just completed the game doing a pacifist run (no mesmerising/killing NPC's for additional XP). It took me a while, and the the main hold up was that enemies could be quite overpowered at times, particularly during boss fights. I ended up doing ALL side missions and doing a lot of opportunistic combat to farm XP but that wasn't enough to progress the skill trees to the top-tier which left me at a bit of a disadvantage. I'm confident though, had I not done the pacifist run and mesmerised the occasional NPC for XP I wouldn't have had much of a problem.I really enjoyed the supporting cast of characters around the districts of London. There are several different areas filled with friendly NPC's that you engage in conversation with. As you talk to different characters, you learn "hints" which open up new lines of dialogue with the current NPC, or another that sits within their social circle. The main benefit of the "hint" system to is to increase the yield of XP you receive from mesmerising people. This had no particular benefit to me on my current play through but It was interesting enough to do regardless. I found myself spending a lot of time early doors running back and forth uncovering the secrets of different NPC's which gave their characters more depth.As I've gotten older, I've had less and less time to commit to games, between work and other commitments. As a result I've not completed many single player games in recent years. Vampyr is a rare example of a game that managed to keep my attention and keep me coming back until completion. I've loved it, and I'm a little sad that it's over if I'm being honest. I would definitely recommend.;Recommended;27.7;30/11/2020;77;N/I
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;What could be more suave than a smartly dressed, british aristocratic doctor who also happens to be a vampire? Step into the shoes of Jonathan Reid, a charismatic doctor returning to London during an epidemic and glamour, charm, bedazzle or murder and bash your way through the streets of a plagued city looking for the cure and shape it's destiny at the closing of the Great War.As divisive as the good doctor's moral dillema of lusting for blood and trying to do good by his Hippocratic Oath, Vampyr brings Victorian era London to life straight from the pages of Penny Dreadfuls. Grimy, dimly illuminated cobblestoned streets, shady characters and ne'er-do-wells, perpetual night punctured by screams and gurgles, a spattering of blood red on the corner of a bench in a foggy park, the game nails the ambience of Gothic Horror and sets a gloomy, sombre city for you to explore. The soundtrack, which is string heavy and not intrusive, but intensifies just at the right moments wraps everything into a densely sorrowful end of days ambience.The game features 4 london districts populated with very finely done, authentic and colorful NPC's and each one has a lot to say. And I do mean a looooot. If you're a very diligent player and want to really see what each of them has to say, you're looking at hours of voiced dialogue. Everything in the game is voiced and they've pulled off some really well-written and performed characters. Almost all of them feature interesting side quests that will grant you rewards and bits of lore. And I do like the lore. There's a lot of it, spread through conversations, side quests, collectibles and the world itself, in art, books and references. Going all out and combining real world history with vampiric fiction just further enhances the feel of the game.There's an interesting mechanic of neighbourhoods changing each time you sleep, depending on your actions and choices. Have you provided medicine for the sick? Have you helped people or mesmerized them, lead them to a dark alley and drained them of blood? The number of choices affecting the mechanics of this is small, but it's nicely done and brings the city to life. It also helps that every NPC is named and has a personal story which you can further unlock by finding hints. And yes, for the murdering beasts out there, you can actually kill all of them and reduce all the neighbourhoods to hostile places full of monsters. The greatest experience gains are tied directly to embracing citizens meaning, if you're going pacifist, from a gameplay mechanic perspective, you're going to be constantly running around underleveled, butting heads and fangs with a small number of different enemies. They're not very varied, but they're consistent and slightly changing as the game progresses, adding to the compactness of the city and fleshing out the story. The bosses of the game are unique NPC's and feature interesting fights, but do suffer of being a bit padded out with large health bars unless you're playing on the Story mode.The game comes from the folks behind Life is Strange and that signature is visible in how the game plays out through dialogue choices and no take backs. No rewind here to see other choices. Once you commit to something, it's done. And further stamped by the game only having an autosave, no multiple save slots. Some may find this slightly irritating, especially if you're an achievement hunter, but for the purposes of presenting a story, it works really well and it features multiple endings. Jonathan is mostly a set character and there are choices you can make to influence the game to a degree, but some big choices are set in stone for you, just like they are in Life is Strange.Now that I've sold you the game with some fancy world building and ideas, time for some more dreary game mechanics. The RPG system the game features, with some weapon upgrade mechanics, basic crafting of cures/healing items and light skill choices and upgrades is serviceable, but I've figured out very quickly that vampire abilites go by the wayside when you upgrade your life, stamina and blood and find a nice two-handed iron club or a scythe that has parry as a special ability. Conjuring grabbing shadows, claw strikes and great leaps at enemies become rather an ineffective way of dealing with them when the most efficient method is dodging/parrying and just clubbing everything in the face which slightly defeats the purpose and immersion of being a powerful vampire that the game serves you. The combat overall feels slightly floaty, wonky, with some suspicious hitboxes particularly visible on enemy grab attacks and becomes tedious the further the game progresses. It doesn't help that the game repopulates enemies when you rest. The folks at DONTNOD also made Remember Me, and it feels to me that Vampyr pulls some combat mechanics from there, but it features a stamina bar, so you'll need to manage that during combat, while Remember Me was combo based and more action oriented. But, as a person that plays too many soulslikes and gripes about combat in them often, a lot of you can probably safely ignore my combat remarks.As a modest open world game featuring 4 neighbourhoods where you can find safehouses and backtracking, the game is missing a fast travel system. I wasn't bothered by this, the streets of London are very good and I found enjoyment in mind mapping all the alleyways of the city and finding shortcuts you can unlock to more easily traverse it. But I can see how this would be a problem for some people.I haven't experienced any technical problems or glitches and not a single crash (played on RTX2070, i7, 32GB of RAM and an SSD), but I did notice that some recent reviews mention that some of the issues, like glitching bosses and crashes that were present at launch still persist.Vampyr is a well paced, very engaging and interesting story game exquisitely using vampire tropes and real world history mixed with some light RPG and crafting mechanics burdened by some toothless and tedious combat that happens too often. If you're not chasing the achievements like vampires victims in the night, I would heavily recommend playing the game in Story mode just to remove the sucky combat out of the equation of your enjoyment of pretending to be a posh british vampire. It'll have the added bonus of making you feel all-powerful. While waiting for Bloodlines 2, this will fill the void very nicely. Or you can go replay Bloodlines for the umpteenth time.Take a peek inside the Cabinet of Curiosities if you like to walk off the beaten path and only sometimes return to the main roads. You might find something worth exploring. And if you do, thank you for the visit.Follow the Average Achievement Hunter Curator for reviews and useful information on Steam achievements: There's a couple of tricky achievements (finishing the game without killing any NPC's and some collectibles) and the game requires 2 playthroughs or some foreknowledge and backup saves because of the game's autosaving system, but that slightly ruins the story experience. Depending on this, the 100% completion time differs a lot. If you're replaying the game, skipping dialogues does save up a lot of time. One achievement, probably the hardest one, doesn't work if you play the game on Story mode. There are good guides on Steam for every situation.;Recommended;54.7;17/08/2020;120;N/I

Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;A quick overviewGreedFall is a third-person ARPG developed by a small French studio, Spiders. It takes inspiration in older BioWare games, like Dragon Age, especially in terms of storytelling. Unfortunately, the scale of the game is too big for such a small team and a modest budget. You play as an emissary of Merchant Congregation. There is an illness, Malichor, which plagues your old continent. But there is hope, an island called Teer Fradee, where its inhabitants do not suffer from this disease. You need to find a cure, and throughout your journey, you discover many hard truths about your family, nation and this disease.The storytelling, lore, and characters are the greatest strengths of this game. The dialogues contain many choices that can decide the fate of factions and people. There are not many sidequests, but each one has an actual impact on the story, due to their connection to factions and characters. But it seems that developers lost themselves with creating these sidequests because the main story feels quite rushed towards the end.The gameplay part is quite variable as it offers a decent combat system, stealth mechanics, companions, crafting, and optional routes, which depend on your statistics. You have several melee weapons and firearms, and you can use magic spells, traps, and bombs. There are many more gameplay mechanics, but unfortunately, most of them are rather clunky or half-finished. The same applies to the locations. They are beautiful but also unnecessarily large, empty and lifeless.For its price of 50€, I can only recommend it to fans of story-driven RPGs, who can forgive the clunkiness of its gameplay. I finished the game in 54 hours. I did all the sidequests I could find. If you are looking just for the story, then prepare for about 20 hours of adventure.Pros & ConsProsGripping story and interesting characters. Multiple dialogue choices. Cutscenes are surprisingly well-made.Sidequests are interesting and implemented into the main story having an impact on its outcome.Beautifully crafted locations, and great weapon and armor design. The same applies to factions and main characters.There are multiple gameplay mechanics that make your progression more diverse. Option to change your companions, craft items and more during the loading is great. Game is well optimized, and I have not encountered any major bugs which I would expect from an RPG game.ConsCombat gets boring fast due to an abnormally large number of monsters and humans in the areas. Although the locations are diverse, the interiors of the buildings are the same in every city.The locations are also empty and lifeless. There are no side activities except the arena.Romance options with your companions are weird and compared to the rest of the writing, inferior.Voice acting of minor characters is of poor quality, as well as lip-sync.In-depth analysisYour character, companions, and craftingAt the start of the game, you create your character and choose from three classes – Warrior, Magic, and Technical. Each class includes a starting set of skills, but you have the freedom to level-up what you want. These skills allow you to use magic, bombs, heavy weapons, and others. You also separately level-up attributes and talents. Attributes increase your stats required for the usage of weapons and armor. They also give you a bonus for your damage and health. Talents are abilities that help you during the exploration, such as lockpicking, climbing, etc.You are able to change weapons, armor, and trinkets for yourself and your companions as well. There are five companions. Each one is from a different faction and has its own set of skills. But only two can follow you at a time. This mechanic has a small impact when you deal with a certain faction. The game has a reputation system for companions and factions. If you are on a friendly status with them, you receive rewards in the form of items. You can craft usable items like potions, ammo, and gear. You can also change your gear appearance and stats via the crafting table.Combat and stealthCombat has a standard lock-on, with light and heavy attacks. For defense, you are able to dodge, roll, and parry. You can throw enemies off their balance by kicking them or shooting them. All enemies have an armor mechanic. To do proper damage, you need to break their armor with a blunt weapon. Unfortunately, the weapons are not very diverse. There are no combos or special attacks that would make you want to try them all as they all feel the same. Due to this, the combat becomes stagnant after a while. It would not be a big problem if the game did not throw an unnecessarily large number of enemies at you in every location.The stealth has a standard “eye” mechanic, meaning that you know exactly when the enemy discovers you. You can also perform stealth attacks, but enemies notice you very quickly. It is a useful mechanic but not a fleshed-out part of the game. You also cannot move or hide bodies.You can use a disguise, but this gameplay part is even more limited. You need to wear a faction’s armor. That allows you to move freely in their territory. Companions are invisible to enemies in these modes. Exploration and enemiesThe game has several locations that you can explore. Unfortunately, most of them are unnecessarily large and empty which leads to long pointless walks. There is almost no reward for exploring these as there are only chests and collectibles. The same applies to cities where its citizens are lifeless. The only side activities are contracts and arena. But both these activities just mean more fighting, which you probably do not want to do.You can find camps throughout the locations where you can rest, change your companions, and craft items. This camp is also available during the loading screen along with a merchant.Human enemies have the same abilities and move set like you. Monsters are not as diverse as I would expect from a mysterious and magical island. They are mostly just larger versions of bulls, reptiles, bears, and bats. On the other hand, boss fights are more interesting as they have a more diverse and unique appearance and move set, but you fight them repeatedly too. Game’s performanceIt was tested on i5 8300H, GTX 1060 6GB, and 8GB RAM on high settings. I encountered frame drops only in the biggest cities, while the game was loading. The only bugs I encountered were small graphical glitches. Final thoughtsGreedFall has many obsolete and clunky gameplay parts, which can discourage many people from playing it. However, the game’s story, atmosphere, and quests are overall worth the gameplay shortcomings.Follow our curator page,  Alexander’s Club Curations, if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.;Recommended;53.7;27/11/2019;368;8
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;This review is entirely my own opinion, spoiler free and attempts to go into good depth about the game with a bullet point summary at the end. Using i5 9th Gen, GTX 1660Ti, 8GB RAM. Introduction: GreedFall is an RPG set in a world suffering the wrath of a plague called the Malichor, and you, a legate, set off with an expedition to the island of Teer Fradee in search of its cure. What follows is a gripping story of friendship, war, diplomacy, and exploration as you meet several interesting characters and have to constantly juggle with the uneasy relations of all factions on the island.  Graphics: The graphics are beautiful. Spiders did a stunning job of building the outside world and making it feel lived in. In the day, the cities look busy, used, and dirty, and have all the makings of a new colony hard at work, and by night they are dark, with lovely lighting from various fires that cast a warm, yet eerie glow in the dark, dangerous back alleys. Flora and fauna and excellent lighting in the wild too make the beautiful.  However, water isn’t quite as good and stood out, but it’s only a small part of the world. More noticeable was that the interiors across all the settlements are copied, with some minor differences for different cities. In a world that was otherwise so intricately designed, this felt lazy and it made the cities and their factions feel less unique, which undid the work of the story and culture design that did make the factions feel different.  Audio: Audio was good. The music served to enhance environments or scenes, but it was a background noise mostly and not like Skyrim where it made a moment. It could have been used to better effect in emotional scenes too, but here were few tracks and they did well with what they had.  Ambient and combat sounds are good. Gunshots have a click before the final shot for when the hammer is pulled back and I really appreciate this! Swords have a metallic sound and make a different noise when striking armour to flesh which I also like.   Voice acting was particularly strong. There were some lines that felt acted, but your character (I played female) is very well-voiced. Most of the supporting cast sound great and convey emotion and personality well and I love the accents of the Congregation characters too, just saying. Gameplay: Levelling: Finishing a 45-hour playthrough I’d not got enough XP to unlock all abilities. I don’t know if this was intended but it felt like bad pacing, especially since you’ll meet with things in the world, like jumping or climbing, that need certain level perks. Thankfully, there was in my experience always an alternative way to deal with these situations. Combat: I usually don’t like combat systems like this but GreedFall wasn’t bad. You get various enemies with different attacks and you dodge them, take down their armour, and then health. You can approach combat how you like and while it’s quite intense, it can get repetitive. When fighting, you can’t interact with the world and it started to bug me that when I’d cleared locations, a few days later, the enemies would be back and I just needed to run through for a quest, I didn’t want another fight. You do get XP from fighting but sometimes in a short quest it hurts the pacing. If there’s space, though, you can avoid combat by running past it. However, you can accidentally leave the fight zone during a fight by dodging and this resets the enemy health, so you have to start again. I disliked repetition of bosses. You come against several big monsters known as Guardians, but you will have to fight them a few times. I’d hoped they would just be boss per region and that would be it. Combat was fine, but I feel it was overused, and it got tiring towards the end of the game. Enemies felt needlessly abundant.Followers: They were a very promising part of the game and get I feel slightly let down by their shortfalls. I really liked the individuality of the followers while keeping obvious ties with their factions, and how they interact with you and other characters in quests, but that’s about as far as it goes. I liked the relations system but wish it had gone further. The romance option is not as fleshed out even as in Skyrim. There’s no marrying or buying a house. Outside specific chats that happen as part of quests or romance you cannot talk to your followers and this made the relationship system feel almost meaningless, as did the fact that if followers have a quest waiting, unless you accept that quest immediately, you cannot talk to them. I would have liked the possibility to have more followers too, or at least not have to lose one when another was locked to my team for a quest. I was a little disappointed after really getting to like Vasco and Siora that I had to remove one of them to do a quest for Petrus. I also experienced a bug where Vasco was locked out of my team. I finished the quest without him, but his dialogue appeared on the screen (no audio) since he should have been there, and after that the bug was fixed.  Story: The story was mostly strong. It touches on some heavy themes around the era such as colonialism, genocide, religious persecution, etc., as the different factions and their ideas fight to prevail in an ever-changing world which they want to dominate.You’ll be faced with some hard decisions that affect the relations of these nations and outcome of the game, making them feel weighty and meaningful which I like. It’s rare in a game we have such influence over its events. Choices affect your relationship with both factions and people, and they treat you differently as a result. This is a level of immersion I’ve longed for in games like Skyrim, where no matter what you do people still treat you badly. I like that there are consequences and the game never outright tells you you made the wrong choice, but you feel it if something happens that you didn’t intend.  Sadly, you’re also sent to do your fair share of fetch and carry missions which didn’t feel consistent with the status of your character, and in the late game it hurt the pacing a lot. There’s sometimes the option to automatically travel where you need to, but I would have liked it more often. That, or better placement of fast travel points so there wasn’t so far to run. Since cutscenes were done so well, Spiders could have used them to mitigate this too. Summary: + Strong story, with multiple endings and choices.  + Strong characters, mostly well-voiced and complex.  + Factions each felt unique with ambitions and beliefs.  + Visually stunning. + No microtransactions. + Told about ‘point of no return’ so you can finish quests/achievements before too late. + Great cutscenes.  - No screenshot mode. - Combat overused, bosses repeated, unable to interact with world in combat.  - Can’t get all achievements first time. - Needless running around for quests.  - Parts of world shut off unless quests are triggered, but they can be missed. - Some emotional scenes/quests felt rushed and lacked emotion. - Flaws with followers hold them back. - As female, characters sometimes use male pronouns for you. - Door animations get annoying, slowing you down. Conclusion: Overall, GreedFall is a good game, lacking a little in technical prowess and with a few irritating faults. But it delivers a strong story with choices that feel meaningful, fleshed out with a colourful cast of characters, and set in a believable, beautiful world. It’s held back by a smaller budget and is a little pricey but for a memorable game with good replay value, I think it can be forgiven in a hope they’ll put the funds to good use to make their next game even better. I love the era this game was set in and I’d like to see the developers revisit it, ironing out a few of the flaws in this. I give it a well-earned 7.5 out of 10.;Recommended;44.4;25/11/2020;621;8
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;I played it through, but only to see the ending. After about 20 hours, it was more a chore than fun.The graphics are nice, the story is mostly very good, with different faction you work for, a lot of people you actually get to know. This could have made this a great game almost in the league of Witcher 3.BUT: The missions themselves are often boring. Some missions only consist of Go to X. Talk to X, X cannot help you but sends you to Y, Go to Y. Y says, that he has seen something that might help you, so try to find Z. You run around, find Z, talk to them, and they say "Yeah, I think you need to go to W". And so on. (No, I'm not exaggerating...)Some missions are confusing. For example, you are supposed to free some rpisoners from a mad doctor, but you don't have the key. You try to find it in a house, but you cannot enter it. Why? Because you first need to actually talk to the prisoners so that they can tell you to find the key, then suddenly the door is open. There are several annoying bugs like that.And the talking to people is often really boring. Dialogue is slow, you often only have one dialogue option but still need to click it to fake action. And several of the options you actually have do not affect the game in the slightest.And yeah, choices matter. What this mainly means is that you have to do all side missions, the more you do, the better the ending (especially the side missions for your companions). Apart from that, not much to choose, and most of it quite obvious.The number of opponents is very limited, there are 6 or 7 types, not more, throughout the large map. So fights start to get boring at some point. Add to this that after some time you are not really in need of loot anymore - so I often evaded the fights or even when I finished them, I did not bother to pick up the loot.The companion system (reminiscent of dragon age games) is supposed to make a difference (the game even says "chose your companions depending on their fighter archetype), but I never noticed a big difference in how difficult the fights were. Just choose the companion that works for the faction you are dealing with and that's about all you need to think about.All in all, this could have been a great game if they had put as much care into the mechanics as they put into the story (which is godd IMO). But as it is, it is just a bit too repetitive and boring.;Not Recommended;41.4;7/11/2022;542;6
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;Listen... I just started and want to throw some things out there for people considering this purchase:x) IMPORTANT CONTEXT!!! Spiders is an indie studio of... maybe a few dozen people... and they've managed to pull together a pretty good looking and competent RPG.x) Lip syncing for the dialogue is very poor. 100%. It is an issue, but it is a small one in my opinion.x) You will either love or hate the voice acting. I personally love it and have thus far heard few, if any, poorly delivered lines or performances. x) Combat is basically... Assassins Creed and Dragon Age had a baby. Enemies seem aggressive and fast, the tactical pause works very well so far, and button mashing is definitely not the way to go. It's taking some getting used to but I really enjoy it. (MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON IS TARGET LOCK BY DEFAULT!)x) The game is pretty. It runs well and has just had a few pop in bugs as for my experience so far. Otherwise it has stable FPS with great visuals, and is very immersive given I am able to overlook the lip syncing issues.I will definitely update the review as I play more of the game and ultimately complete it... but if you can maintain the proper perspective, appreciate that this is a less than full price release, and are a fan of character driven RPGs? You'll have a fine time playing this... and again... the lip syncing is bad... if you can get past that (something that can be fixed over time, even though yesyesyes it shouldn't need to be) there is a lot to love here!From the jump I'm just going to say this is a welcome breath of fresh air in an industry loading games with "rpg" mechanics that don't f***ing need them.;Recommended;7.8;9/09/2019;1,359;46
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;I don't write many reviews, but this game definitely deserves it. I'll try and be brief and to the point so we can all get back to playing ASAP! PROS:1. Quest system: after 15+ hours I haven't had a single fetch quest. Most of them you can solve in multiple ways.2. Dialogue: well written and although in old timey style, it isn't pretentious and really fits the game. As a bonus, most voice work is great which is surprising for a smaller dev.3. Combat: its fluid and well executed, tactical pause is a must on hard+. Challenging but not maddening. (unless yoy try and do arena at level 5, bring some pots and antidotes is all I'm saying...)4. World building: factions are believable and they have their own motivations that make sense in game. Natives have many tribes with their own approach, as well. While they reuse assets, it's not as bad as DA2, imo and the game looks good.5. Stability: not a single crash or even major FPS loss (tho I understand this is  down to individual machine probably and mine is a decent rig). CONS:1. While combat is fun, enemy variety is lacking (which I understand, but still).2. Facial animations are off (not hugely distracting).3. Customization of your character is pretty basic, less options than in most modern RPGs.4. Few bugs such as killed enemies stay up (stealth killed Naut guards in New Selene for instance). Not major but definitely something to iron out.TLDR a great, unique western RPG with a few quirks but very enjoyable. Highly recommended! Thanks Spiderman. Err... Spiders!;Recommended;71.5;11/09/2019;350;17
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;GreedFall starts solid, walking on old Bioware paths reminiscent of Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect and Jade Empire. With a party of three, you explore a historical 18th-century expedition setting mixed with fantasy to uncover the secrets of a distant island to find a cure for a mysterious disease. While doing so you have to maintain diplomatic relationships with various factions that have different goals and opinions. The RPG elements are well designed. There is quite some decision making with immediate and long time consequences. Character development is varied for both combat and world interaction and there are seemingly interesting companions with their agenda and side-quests - and of course, options to romance them. The graphics are mostly beautiful, especially the varied areas like the three cities, lush forests, epic mountains and wide fields. The downright ugly character faces and facial animations stand in jarring contrast to that. And these are only the first cracks in the overall picture of the game that start showing early. GreedFall was created by a comparably small developer studio that was punching over its weight here. It shows in various aspects of the game. The combat is clunky and janky. The three cities of the island are small and feel lifeless. Some key buildings that you visit dozens of times throughout the game are literal copy & paste jobs. The world is divided into zones and while they look great they are very limited in scope. Even big forest and mountain areas sometimes feel like small corridor levels that you are funnelled through with tons of invisible walls instead of "exploring". Loot is randomly scattered through the game world. Hidden treasure chests in distinctive areas are often just junk. The stealth and disguise system of the game is a complete joke but can at least be ignored for most parts.All of these problems show pretty early in the game. But I was still interested enough in the world, the story, my companions and building my character to ignore most of the issues. But the more I played, the more bored I got because the character arcs and the main story don't lead to much in the end. The same goes for the side-quests that are ultimately uninteresting. And then it feels like the game completely falls apart in the second half. On the one hand, the gameplay becomes incredibly repetitive and there is a lot of backtracking. You get sent all over the island to talk to person A to get them item B for hours and hours. All while fighting the same five enemies and three boss-type monsters over and over again. It's content for the sake of content and it isn't enjoyable. On the other hand, the story takes the most generic, predictable way you can think of, leading to just another highly generic fantasy tale. The unique setting doesn't get used in any interesting way at all.In the end, GreedFall is a remarkable accomplishment for a small developer studio, but ultimately a very mediocre game with lots of issues. I don't want to hold back anyone to give it a try - it's cheap enough during sales. But I can't recommend it because there are so many better RPGs out there.;Not Recommended;39.8;13/04/2022;617;3
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;Before playing I waited, like a patient gamer, and made sure I understood the various problems other reviewers had with the game.  So I did a few things to make my time enjoyable and it definitely helped playing this game. A few mods that improved quality of life:* Camera overhaul - to get rid of the camera sway* More carry weight - so I could keep exploring and not worry about running back and forth to town* Player complexion - add a bit of nicer textures during close up conversationsAdditionally I used Nvidia Freestyle (basically Reshade) to remove the brown filter and make the colors appear more lush and vibrant. And finally I turned the HUD off completely - I only needed to use the map sometimes, but it was a great way to experience the gorgeous low-fantasy environments in this game.   The environment was my favorite part. the cities were nice of course, and I liked that they weren't massive (I completely disagree that modern RPGs need to have large cities).  It was even better going out into the wild and exploring the pleasant autumnal locales, admiring the streams and trails and seeing what the natives of the island would have enjoyed.  Exploring without the HUD gave it that extra level of immersion. The voice acting and story are good, they go well together and none of the characters feel overboard or poorly represented.  The various factions were each appealing in their own way, even Theleme who I initially disliked, turned out to be not-that-bad. The graphics were quite good but definitely on the heavy side. I played at ultra everything on RTX 2080 Ti, and even so my temperatures went up to around 72C!  Definitely tweak the settings and reduce what you can to get the most out of this game.One thing to note the initial starting area/starting island makes it look duller than it needs to be.  The starting area is just that - a tutorial - get out of there and onto the main story area, the game really picks up there.;Recommended;48.1;20/06/2020;219;2
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;When I stumbled upon this game the first time it didn't caught my attention. I wasn't really interested in the fictional New World, and mixed reviews made me cautious about trying it. Then one of my friends compared it with Dragon Age: Inquisition, saying “it looks just like it”, and I, being a hopeless Dragon Age fan, decided to give it a try. And oh boy, that was a wise decision, because GreedFall managed to make me love it within the first hour.Pros:• The plot. It's engaging, intriguing and magical. The protagonist is a diplomat helping their cousin, who is freshly appointed governor of one of the cities on the mysterious island, so the game is politics-heavy. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found this aspect of the game well-written and interesting. Mix it with heavy dose of magic and you'll get a very thrilling adventure. Plot twists are good, enraging in the best way possible… and sad. I never felt bored.• The setting. It's beautiful, mystical, logical, sometimes eery, sometimes brutal. I didn't have a feeling I'm running between cardboard scenery.• The protagonist is canonically smart.• All of the characters are very well-written and have distinct personalities, even the minor ones.• Level design. The island of Tír Fradí is consistent with its visuals, and the cities have obvious copypasting, but all of them look magnificent.• Fractions. There are four of them (five, if you count the one the protagonist is a part of), and each one has its own long chain of quests.• Sidequests are good, numerous and aren't focused on “kill twenty beasts/collect ten flowers” objectives. There are fetch quests on bulletin boards in the fractions' camps, but they are completely optional and have no impact on the plot. I think I've counted about six or eight of them? A drop in the sea.• You nearly always have an option to complete a quest in different ways. Diplomacy, violence, lying, sneaking, sneaking using appropriate armor to fool your enemies…• Classes. No one is forcing you to be only a swordsman, shooter or a mage: you can stun your enemies with magic, shoot them from the distance and finish them with a rapier. I find that approach very refreshing and fun.• Talent bonuses from the companions. After you befriend them, they add +1 point to your talents. For example, Kurt raises your Craftsmanship, while Siora makes you more vigorous. That way you don't need to maximize some of the talents, while sacrificing others. • Voice acting. It's really good, and there are some familiar voice actors, like Alastair Parker and Ramon Tikaram.• Home base. Every major city provides a residence for the protagonist. You can find there a crafting table, storage chest and fast travel globus. It also gives you an option to rest if you need to do a quest requiring a particular time of day.• Optimization. I have a decent graphics card, but my processor is very old — so old it doesn't meet even the minimum requirements for Mass Effect: Andromeda. Despite that, I was able to play with everything set on Ultra. There was some lagging in the cities, but that's it.• Soundtrack. It's unobtrusive, magical and suitable for every situation.Cons:• Since you can freely explore almost every corner of the map, including plot-related locations, you can stumble upon a spoiler… reading the codex. It updates locations' descriptions according to your exploration progress, and there was a time when I found out a crucial detail about the protagonist just because I visited one of the caves. Not cool, man.• You can bring with you only two companions at once.• …And they aren't the most talkative people. All of them are truly well-written and they gradually open up during the game, but I would like to have more options to talk about personal matters, or hear some banters. They do make comments during the quests, though, and frequently.• An imitation of life within cities and villages — or lack of. Yes, NPCs are walking and doing stuff, but it's nowhere near the illusion of actually living society you can see in Skyrim or the Witcher.• Loot. It's pretty boring, to be honest, and almost all armors are fractional.• No jumping.• Fighting system is a bit clunky and requires some time to get used to it. Dodging and rolling aren't always responsive, so you can get hit even if you pressed the button in time.• The game has a day/night cycle, but not a weather system. • Facial animations aren't great, but you get used to it after a couple of hours.• There are some inconsistencies in the dialogues related to the protagonist's sex. It happened two or three times in my playthrough, but I heard it's a bigger problem in other languages. Luckily, patches are keeping adressing this issue.+/-• It's not an open world game — there are invisible walls and all that. I personally prefer it that way.• Romances. Characters are amazing and flirting is sweet, but romance scenes start somewhat… awkwardly. Romance content is very, very limited, and you can lock yourself out of it if you choose wrong dialogue options. Still, it's better to have this option than not have it at all, I guess.• When you travel to the new zone you end up in the small road camp first, where you can trade, craft and talk with companions, while the level you're heading is loading. It's pretty useful, but if you're doing quests with lots of traveling, these stops can become tiresome. Suffice to say, you can leave the camp at any time — you don't need to wait until the level is fully loaded, it's mostly for your own (and your processor/graphics card) comfort.• There is lots of traveling, by the way. Usually I'm pretty indifferent to mounts, but I wish I had them in GreedFall. Locations aren't that big, and you can set up camps with fast travel option, but you still be spending quite some time on foot.• Character creation allows you to choose a preset, but you can't modify it. Most of them have similar bone structure, but — boom! — it actually has a meaning behind it. I love customizing my characters, but I don't want to complain about GreedFall's chargen: I like its faces.• The protagonist has canonical surname. you can't name them. It doesn't matter that much, but I find that odd.Overall, I give GreedFall 8/10. The game has its issues, but it was an amazing adventure in a beautiful world. I'm utterly happy I decided to give it a try and want to encourage everyone to do the same.;Recommended;85.8;3/11/2019;220;9
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;Greedfall is a unique and interesting game to say the least. A lot of people have tried to fully compare this game to Mass Effect 1/2 and Dragon Age 1/Inquisition. Honestly, I don't think such a comparison does the game justice. This is a brand new RPG IP built completely from the ground up by a single or double A studio with probably some of the smoothest performance and most solid gameplay I've seen from an RPG title. That being said, it does have subtle similarities to various other games, but with its own established universe.You play as De Sardet, the cousin of Constantin D'Orsay, son to the prince of the Congregation of Merchants of The Old World. You are a legate, sort of a representative for Constantin and the Congregation once you reach Teer Fradee, where the majority of the game takes place. Throughout the game, there are six main factions you need to be aware of. The Congregation of Merchants are sort of your home base faction. They're interested in trade, profit, and diplomatic neutrality. Next, you have the Coin Guard, an army of mercenaries with an honor code that will work for whoever pays them. After them are the Nauts, a group of seafarers with the ability to expertly navigate from the old world to the new. Next, there's the Bridge Alliance, a nation primarily interested in science and alchemy. Then, we have Theleme, a nation of religious folk who seek to convert the natives of Teer Fradee, among others, to their religion worshiping a being they call "The Enlightened" (their version of a god). Lastly, we have the natives of Teer Fradee, a race of people who seek to protect the environment of the island and worship a variety of creatures, guardians who protect them, and a number of spirits and gods. The basic overarching goal of the game is to go to Teer Fradee in search of a cure to a bloodborne curse-like affliction known as the Malichor that is ravaging The Old Continent.You will gather companions during your adventures that will help in combat and in various conversations/situations. Your first companion is Kurt, one of the Coin Guard and basically the reason you even know how to fight. Next is Vasco, a captain among the Nauts that is reluctant at first to leave his ship and crew, but after being grounded by the admiral, agrees to join you on your adventures. Then we are introduced to Siora, one of Teer Fradee natives who is the daughter of one of the village chiefs. Next is Petrus, a priest of Theleme who we find out we actually met long before the events of the game on the old continent. Lastly, we have Aphra, a Bridge Alliance scientist and expert in ranged weaponry. Your relationship with your companions will vary based on your actions throughout the game. Depending on your character's gender and various dialogue choices, it is even possible to have a romantic relationship with one of them.Now to general gameplay. Combat is somewhat satisfying, particularly against bosses. It can be a bit simplistic though. Fast traveling does exist, sort of. You go through camp loading sequences to get from one region to the next. In melee combat, you have basic attacks, parrying, and fury mode which allows you to deal several powerful hits in a row. You will need to upgrade your armor and weapons with gear you obtained by various means throughout the world. There are also a number of side quests and missions you can undertake between main quests. As you level up, you gain points to spend on three different skill trees: skills, attributes, and talents. Skills are for combat, attributes for general gameplay and traversal, and talents for various character abilities such as crafting or charisma in conversations. Depending on the things you put points into, this will determine your entire playstyle. You can also reset points as long as you have a memory crystal. Also, you'll need to keep an eye on your reputation with various factions and companions. It is possible to make everyone friendly towards you depending on your choices in the game. If you have a friendly reputation with all parties, you have the ability to get probably the best ending to the game. I won't spoil anything, because it's a good story you have to experience for yourself to appreciate.So, yeah, I really like the game. I heard about this before its release and decided to buy it. I was not disappointed. It pleasantly surprised me with how simple and yet how intriguing it was. I really liked all the companion characters and really came to care about them and their motivations. There were also a number of NPCs that genuinely had me invested in the story and made me want to learn and know more. The fact that they also crafted a unique language for the Natives also thoroughly impressed me for a smaller studio of developers. Even if I couldn't understand it all the time, I did learn a little bit of it and I was impressed by its consistency. Overall, an easy 7 to 9 out of 10 game. It does a lot right. Not a lot of bugs or problems. Just a pure, simple, and engaging game that draws you into its world and makes you want to know all its secrets. I definitely recommend it.;Recommended;52.7;4/08/2020;245;3

Focus Home Interactive;SnowRunner;Adventure, Simulation;R$ 99,90;The other day I drove home in my old car. It had already started to snow heavily and it was getting worse. The winter road clearance service was still asleep and the snow kept piling up on the roads. When I turned into a road, my car slid into a snow bank. The front tires were still on the snow-covered road but were also stuck. I stepped on the gas but nothing moved. I just thought to myself "♥♥♥♥, that's it". I got out and thought about it.  While I was standing there rummaging in my trunk to find any tools, I remembered that I played Snowrunnrer a few months ago. I thought about what I did there with the vehicles to get out of the mud and snow. In Snowrunner, you don't just accelerate and hope that the car comes out straight ahead: you wiggle the steering wheel wildly, drive forwards, backwards and then somehow you get out of the mud with maneuvers that are totally contrary to your driving instinct. Well, that's what I tried. Five minutes later I was home. I can recommend the game.;Recommended;13.9;7/12/2023;136;32

Focus Home Interactive;SnowRunner;Adventure, Simulation;R$ 99,90;I’ve put a fair few hours into this game now, so I should probably put some words down on what I think of it. Just the base game. If you want DLC reviews those’ll be separate. I am sure you can look up my reviews on those somehow if you’re interested.Snowrunner is on the surface a driving game where you plug mud in oversized trucks. You never go fast, with the early game bogging you down the best it can and learning you the ropes. I think generally the maps are really well designed in the base game, teaching you what you need to do to excel at this game should you play the maps in order. However, the game doesn’t do a very good job of explaining what’s going on so you might need to play with a friend that can fill you in, or go look up some youtube tips. Also while it might be really tempting to go to the latter parts of the game and get some powerful trucks, or even get the DLC trucks, I would also recommend against that. The front end of this game feels very deliberate in that it’s giving you specific vehicles that will teach you through your faults. That means you’re going to tip over, you’re going to get stuck and generally have a bit of a bad time. If you’re not one that learns lessons through trial and error, this game might be a miss for you.Throughout the game you will unlock roads, unlock better vehicles, upgrades and map knowledge, which is just as important as the tools you’re using. A lot of the time knowing exactly what a route is going to present to you challenge wise is  half the battle. It could be anything from deep mud, aggressive camber, running water, rocks, tight turns, steep hills, icy roads and even fallen trees or pylons. Knowing what to use, where to use it and getting the best from your fleet is the really rewarding part. Speaking of fleet, let's talk about the vehicles in the base game. Pretty much everything here can be useful in some regard. Each truck is assigned a class.Scouts are small vehicles used for looking around the map. They are used for finding your way to watch towers to uncover the map and supply and fix vehicles that might have gotten themselves in a bind. There’s some really powerful ones in the base game, some of which I am still using deep into the season passes, although there are a few better options in the DLC’s.Offroaders are your next class up and they do exactly what you think they do. More capable than the Scouts, but unable to get to places where the more nimble and narrower Scouts can get. Again, there’s a few vehicles here that age very well into the late game should you choose to go that far.Next up are the Heavy class. Heavy are everything the Offroaders were and more, with some very specialised equipment that are more used for a specific task, such as carrying logs, or running fuel in larger quantities than the other classes can. The added weight and strength means they are better at getting your stuck or overturned vehicles out of the mud and snow.Heavy Duty is somewhere between Offroad and Heavy. It’s a mixed bag here, but just pick the one you feel most attuned with. It’ll get everything you need doing in the first 3 scenarios. Finally we have Highway. I’m not entirely sure why this class exists in this game as it’s nearly useless. There is one vehicle that can be upgraded to be very good, but that’s outside the realm of the vanilla game so I won’t delve into it too much.Each vehicle you have can have attachments and upgrades applied to them, some of which unlock after you have earned enough XP to make them available to you. It’s a bit like an RPG where each vehicle you have becomes something you get really familiar with, what it’s capable of and what it won’t be able to accomplish.Missions in the game are broken into a few parts. There’s tasks which are usually just jobs that might take 30 minutes or so, and then there’s contracts, which provide an overall theme and story to each area and offer a big goal to achieve before moving onto the next area. Could be anything between setting up sawmills, installing oil rigs, searching for oil deposits. It’s not exactly Shakespear, but it doesn’t need to be.Gameplay consists of taking everything I’ve just written about and putting it all together. I think sometimes it would be easier to describe this as a puzzle game that is about driving over anything else, because you’re often tasked with dilemmas that have no easy answer. Sometimes the solution is easy, sometimes it’s hard, but often there’s many ways to get what you need done. Different players may approach things in various ways than what another player might. There’s really no real answer.For the most part Snowrunner is a chill game. You potter about in the mud and snow and everything is fine, but things can fall apart really quickly and become very stressful. When you spend a night moving cargo from one end of the map to the other and it keeps falling off, or you tip over multiple times, or even worse you tip over, and then the vehicle you came back in to perform the rescue in tips over as well, it can lead to some ALT F4 moments. I think anyone that has played Snowrunner can confirm this. The rage is just something you let simmer and then come back again when it has dissipated. In the 3 vanilla areas there’s nothing that should really cause massive frustration though, a lot of mishaps come down to bad planning or just not paying attention. Again, you’re going to be taught a lot of lessons by experiencing failure. It’s OK to fail in this game. You’ve nothing to prove. Just get out there and drive and try to make sure you don’t fall for the same thing twice. It can totally be played in single player, but I would recommend bringing a friend along. The extra bit of grunt, the fuel and supplies and an extra winch point are all welcome. It’s my preferred way to play. It’s all cross platform as well if you have a buddy that plays anywhere else but steam. All of this works mostly flawlessly. In the hundreds of hours I’ve played, I’ve seen a few bugs, but nothing that would really mess up a session.While we’re talking about performance, I must mention that you should not buy this game if you’re not running an SSD. It constantly saves and the act of saving stutters the game on mechanical HDD’s. I don’t know why they did it like this and didn’t just have a manual save to get around this, but it’s a weird decision that will impact those of us that play on older hardware. I know it impacted me before I upgraded and it was insufferable and sometimes even caused me to tip.I can recommend this game, even if you only skim through it. Grab it on sale and give it a whirl. There’s nothing really like it elsewhere on the market, some people might be more at home with Euro or American Truck Simulator, but those that are looking for something with a bit more meat on the bones and less procedural generated jobs should feel more at home here. Just be aware that it will test your patience.;Recommended;659.8;6/01/2024;99;N/I

That is why American Truck Simulator did not have a long lifespan for me.I was certain that Snowrunner would amount to the same experience as American Truck Simulator but was happily proven wrong. Snowrunner may be a game about work but doesn't feel like work to play. To describe the game in one word, I would call it satisfying. There are several different vehicles, each with unique handling that makes test driving so much fun, and each vehicle feels very satisfying when driven right. There are several, massive maps with interesting layouts that makes exploration feel satisfying and rewarding. Each task presents an adequate challenge which felt incredibly satisfying to complete, especially so when many challenges require a combination of careful planning, raw skill, and, sometimes, a little bit of luck.I strongly recommend everyone pick this game up, especially if it isn't traditionally your style of game.

Makes no sense to me how you are going to release two DLC's together. One of them included in the year pass and one of them is just some scout SUV's that can do next to nothing in the game, not included in the "YEAR PASS". Why do you need to tax people so much for a game they have already supported countless times? There is no purpose of the "YEAR" pass if everything from the "YEAR" isn't in it. This practice is disgusting and I do not support it in anyway.

Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;To summarise, The Surge 2 is another quality Soulslike offering from Deck 13. Rather than continuing the story from the point of view of the same character as in the previous game (The Surge), you play as a nameless survivor of a plane crash who awakens in the city of New Jericho, which is under quarantine due to an outbreak of a nanite disease.First, I'll get the bad out of the way:Compared to the previous game, this one seems to be graphically less impressive. The Surge set expectations high, with excellent lighting & texture detail, and overall superb art style. The problems that The Surge 2 has seem to be (a) the lighting is off (oversaturated in places) and (b) the world lacks detail in certain places, as if the developer did not have time to add clutter or refine textures to make them look used or weathered over time. for example, some brick surfaces are perfectly flat and flawless as if God himself came down from heaven to show mortal bricklayers how it's done.Onto the good:Combat is much like The Surge except that now there is a new directional parry system. Unlike The Surge, where opponents could be staggered by blocking just before an enemy strike lands, it is now necessary to block AND make a gesture with the mouse in the appropriate direction at exactly the right instant. This takes a lot of getting used to, and to be perfectly honest, three playthroughs later (I have just finished NG+2), I still don't feel like I have mastered it. According to the developer, it's possible to finish the game without using directional parry at all, but I don't believe it to be an optimal way to play. Overall, combat is fun and rewarding, especially when pulling off a directional parry and counter-strike.Like the previous game, new gear and weapons are obtained by finding or by cutting it off something or somebody else. Gear and weapons are upgraded through parts which are (you guessed it) obtained by cutting them off something or somebody else. I cut off enough limbs in my playthroughs to keep New Jericho's kebab shops stocked for months.There are more sidequests compared to the previous game, and they are entertaining enough. Completing them generally provides gear or weapons which can't be obtained any other way.Technically, the game appears to be satisfactory, for me at least, given that an update resolved my performance issues. I experienced a couple of crashes to desktop in 116 hours of gameplay.I sometimes found myself unsure about how to proceed for a sidequest, but I don't fault the game for that. I attribute this mostly to my failure to pay attention to instructions / hints, having become accustomed to modern games that lead players by the nose with quest markers. There are no quest markers in this game, and personally I like that. Difficulty is sufficiently high that, for an old-timer whose reflexes are not what they used to be combined with a completionist bent and a tendency to check every nook and cranny, the first playthrough can easily be 50 hours.I give a solid thumbs up to The Surge 2 and look forward to what Deck 13 do next.;Recommended;116.8;10/11/2019;98;5
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;If you see that mixed up there and you're concerned, the majority of the bad reviews are "Game would not open." or saying the game mechanics suck while at 0.4 hours played. This is not an easy game. You will have to learn. If you don't like learning and dying, just don't even try man.However if you're not someone like that here's my first impression. I really enjoy the way you get new equipment more than I thought I would. The executions are cool (Tho they aren't many) and I've enjoyed collecting various sets so far. The combat is a little confusing. I can't really tell what I need to do to confirm a stagger yet. Mostly how I've been playing is dodging and waiting for openings. The weapons are neat, however the game gave me these duel swords that stack a dot that does MASSIVE damage when the bar fills. It's just plain better than anything else I have. The worlds are big and pretty fun to explore. Most of the time your going to find a dead end with a path you can't access without a certain item. Like the EMP for example. Although perhaps I just missed it. One thing I will say is that the camera can be pretty annoying sometimes. Like as in your view will be in a wall or some random thing and that'll cause you to get hit because you couldn't see it coming. Other than that I'm enjoying it and I'm excited to progress further. If you're a fan of Souls likes than this is one worth picking up but perhaps on sale.;Recommended;6.4;23/09/2019;653;13
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;This game Supports Ultrawide Natively!  Just throwing that out there for my folks with Ultrawide setups.  That being said I'm about 6 hours in and I've just been grinding the first major level after a boss and having a blast.  The new jump mechanics are delightful.  I feel like the drone mechanics are an improvement over the last game.  The limb removal and farming is very similar which I love.  I just kinda fell back into it.  It's a good challenge and the game looks pretty good as well.  For a game to run well on launch day, support ultrawide resolutions, and be fun is sort of rare.  And that the game wasn't $60-70 really made this a great buy for me.  I love the setting, the focus on combat and exploration, and the mixing and matching of different armors, weapons, and playstyles.  I think other developers could take some pointers.  My only positive criticism comes largely from my friends wishing that The Surge 2 supported co-op.  I bet it would take the level layout to another place entirely, but I will say that a game with these mechanics but with co-op sounds like a blast.  Just throwing that out there.  I was looking forward to this for months and I am so happy I had all my expectations met.  I'm a happy nerd.;Recommended;17.0;24/09/2019;127;2
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;I feel bad for Deck 13 cos this game is in many ways being unfairly ravaged. My personal motto with the Surge was, "It's going to get fun soon." In the end I finished the game and felt totally ambivalent about it. Some parts were good, other parts were bland, and some of it was bad. Mostly unbalanced enemies, boring boss fights and same same level design. But for what it was it was a good attempt.However, the Surge 2 is seriously tickling my pickle. Combat feels more fluid, is more balanced and has more customisation. The violence is still epic. The bosses I've fought thus far haven't been incredible, but are a strong improvement over the first. Same same level design is still a problem, but not in any way as much as in the first game, and there are some quality of life improvements past the half way point that are seriously welcome. As for performance there are some issues, however, I'm running the game on very high settings and have had no crashes or serious issues. I had a dreadful frame rate drop when I emerged form the prison to look over what became a very janky city-scape, but that's really it, besides the occasional frame-rate drop here and there. Lastly, we need to support these guys for delivering an awesome game, that they are working hard to improve as we speak. We are pretty spoiled for choice these days, but if we don't stop slagging off smaller dev teams when they don't deliver perfection we are going to end up with companies like EA, Bethesda, Epic etc running the show and then we have a future of uber buggy, trash teir, micro transaction filled crud to look forward to. This is a good game, I hope it sells well and I hope deck 13 make another, and if they improve the next as much as they have from Surge 1 to Surge 2 it will be flipping amazing. No two ways about it;Recommended;35.3;27/09/2019;79;5
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;While i don't really like comparing games, i gonna compare it to "The Surge" a little bit. Because it is the same game series and it's also very similar to the first one. They just took everything good from the first game and made it better. Pros:1. Soulsborne-like gameplay and combat. Really not much changed there.2. Futuristic, robotic, sci-fi setting.3. Great level design and gameworld. Everything is connected again. No corner in the world seems random, there is always something you can discover. Tech scrap, implants, a new shortcut.4. Even bigger variety of armor and weapons. The old stuff and a lot of new sets and weapons.5. Not as many implants to build around, but nearly all of them are pretty useful for the right build.6. Blocking and parrying finally is useful and actualy one way to play the game. I was still using it just on occasion, dodged myself thought the game most of the time and didn't had any problems.7. Drone combat is much more useful.8. So a lot of viewable builds you can go for. Drone combat, parry, ultra-aggresiv, hit-hit-dodge, chicken. Really whatever you prefer.9. Boss fights are even better and more intense. Also a lot of mini-bosses this time around. Enemy placement is great.10. Maybe because i played the first game so often, but i think it is a bit easier.11. Story is better and feels more "whole". NPCs are great and well implied into the plot. Some dialogs and references are just fantastic and just because of that totally worth to play. Voice acting is fantastic.12. Very short, but an absolutly enjoyable DLC (The Kraken).13. Good replay value at least for a second time, because of New Game +. Around 30-40 hours of playtime, with "The Kraken Dlc".14. I encountered no bugs, or crashes. Just a few graphical glitches here and there.Neutral:1. Atmosphere isn't as immersive and intense as the first one and you play more in the outside world. Which isn't bad, but i enjoyed my time while crawling through dark corridors all the time, inside the creo complex a bit more.2. Really dark again in some places, even with your lights out.3. Graphical optimization could be better.Cons:1. While the grind level isn't as high as in the first one, you still need to spend some time farming parts. I hope the change the upgrade system for a third installment.Conclusion:If you like the genre and/or enjoyed the first game, you can't do much wrong and give this game a try. I really can't unterstand that many bad reviews. Don't compare it to Dark Souls, just because it's the same type of game. Enjoy the little gems the Action-RPG genre had offered us in recent years. Like Nioh 1 and 2, The Surge 1 and 2, Code Vein, Remnant: From the Ashes, Nier. You name it. There all good for a few hours of playtime. At least.I highly recommended "The Surge 2" at full price, or on a sale. It's not a must, but playing "The Surge" first might be a good idea.Ps.: Here is my review from the first game if you interested in buying it. https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067265072/recommended/378540/;Recommended;48.9;19/07/2020;65;N/I
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;Deck13 have risen far from their bland and uninspiring Lords of the Fallen outing and have crafted a good mechanical and industrial soulslike in the first The Surge. With the second one, they've elevated dancing, stamina based combat, meaty and gory dismemberments and a small, compact world full of twisting paths and shortcuts to an artform.The Surge 2 puts you in the role of an anonymous Jane/Joe Doe, flying into Jericho City on a plane that gets knocked out of the skies by some kind of disaster. After a few flashbacks of a young girl that was seemingly on the plane with you, you wake up in a prison hospital and need to punch, chop, sever and mutilate your way out through some escaped prisoners, security bots and a heated fight with the prison warden.The story quickly dissolves into typical sci-fi meanderings of AI, mergers of man and machine, some kind of cyberdisease called Defrag, grizzled military jacks, nano machines absorbing everything and turning the world into Grey Goo and all the other tropes you can imagine. Tried and trusted. There are a few interesting characters and some side quests thrown into the mix, but they all seem to be on the comedic side and are not really taken seriously.The true stars here are Jericho City itself, with it's districts, twisting and looping alleys, passages and shortcuts, the game's flowing, breakdance style, chunky combat and the satisfying character progression of collecting weapons and armour pieces and mix and matching them until you're satisfied with the bonuses. Or fashion, like any true Souls player knows.Combat is very dancelike, swings and stabs pushing you forward or sideways as you execute them, swankily melding into finishers and limb chopping. But beware of button mashing. One button press does not always mean one swing and overeagerness will quickly drain you of stamina and leave you exposed. And you will die fast, as enemies pack a real punch, and will flatten you with just a few swings.Dodging doesn't really give you any iframes and you need to pay attention to the direction of enemy swings. Directional parrying is also a great addition to the game, allowing you to quick parry enemies, temporarily stunning them and allowing you to execute huge hits. When you master this, it sometimes feels slightly overpowered. Battery power, usable for healing, finishing moves and several boost injections, is gained by attacking enemies.There's a large amount of different armours and weapons you can cleave and scrap from various gangs, military and robots wandering Jericho City. Targeting individual body parts and then breaking the armour allows you to do a finishing move when the enemies' health bar drops low enough, divesting them of the targeted part with an assortment of deathblow animations. When you do it for the first time, you get a schematic for the part, each subsequent dismemberment gets you upgrade parts depending on the level of the enemy.Armours come in three classes, operator, sentinel and goliath (light, medium and heavy) and give half and full set bonuses usually corresponding to the type of armour. In combination with a plethora of weapon types, from one handed metal scrap blades to giant military axes spewing electricity, you can create builds that focus on specific game mechanics. You could be a heavily armoured tank that relies on blocking and parrying to deliver monstrous blows with a giant piece of machinery or a nimble, fleet footed warrior that uses quick stab attacks with a spear and has reduced stamina costs for dodging.The drone got a hefty upgrade from the first game and is really useful this time, coming with a few different weapons and abilities. You'll acquire it very quickly and there are armours and implants that synchronize very well with it and it can become a viable build.You can freely combine and experiment with different builds and your basic stats can be reset for a very meager tech scrap cost, the game's currency for upgrading. You can further boost your build mechanics with implants, adding even more stat and ability boosting bonuses. Each armour part and implant uses power that increases with your main level. The better the armour part or implant, the more power it uses. A minor gripe, certain combinations become a bit unbalanced and very powerful and can easily make the game a breeze or a leisurely stroll to the end.The bosses are kind of hit and miss. Some are very easy even with inferior equipment, while some are annoyingly tough, multi phased, with weirdly directed attacks and iffy animations to judge them properly. Even with that, levelling, properly equipping yourself and learning those janky patterns can turn them into milder irritations.Medbays are positioned fairly and finding the shortcuts will sometimes surprise you with how well they loop around and make your trips to the boss fights or the place where you got your head smacked in, losing the scrap, short and relatively hassle free. Online play consists of painting graffiti with your drone, leaving messages or a mini game of hiding your banner and the less players find it, the larger your tech scrap reward is when time runs out. It's a bit useless and gimmicky. You can easily farm more scrap  than the mini game gives out.The arhitecture of the City, lots of tight corridors and a few bosses that move fast do cause some camera problems. In the boss fights, you can usually outdistance it until the camera settles down, but tight corridors are another pair of gloves, often causing you to take hits because you're staring at a piece of a brick wall or steel instead of the enemy. And there were some visual bugs and glitches, but nothing major or game breaking.The Kraken DLC, accessed rather late in the game, continues with the man vs. machine story, puts you on a decommissioned aircraft carrier, VBS Krakow, and pits you against robotic pirates in a strange 90's sitcom neighbourhood built on the carrier. It's a bit short, with some tough enemies and a combat arena when you finish, but is otherwise just more of The Surge 2. And that's a good thing. All other DLC's, even the paid ones, are purely cosmetic, bring nothing to the gameplay and are easily avoided.The Surge 2 improves on the first game in every way. From the bedlam that is Jericho City to the really crunchy, satisfying combat, Deck13 have fused very solid gameplay parts to some slightly brittle tehnical and story ones, but have made a sturdy, enjoyable compound that stands as a solid and competent soulslike.More off the beaten path games, wonders and failures at the Cabinet of Curiosities.Follow the Average Achievement Hunter Curator for reviews and useful information on Steam achievements: Most of the achievements are straightforward, there are a couple of side quests you need to pay attention to, a few collectible missables and the game has 2 ending achievemenents.

Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;In the contest between this and Code Vein, the winner of the Soulslalike contest is... Both of them!TLDR: Both this and Code Vein are worthy purchases, albeit for very different reasons, which game is your cup of tea will depend heavily on personal preference, I'll go into that below.The Surge 2 follows up as a direct sequel to the original, and storywise assumes that you modified the payload that goes up into space with the USB stick that you get from the good doctor about midway through the first game. This has the net result of preventing the worst of the Utopia launch, namely killing everyone very quickly, but also results in the nanites picking up elements of the boss you fight at the very end of the first game. I'm trying to avoid too many named spoilers but covering this element of the story is important because it sets the stage for the world you enter in the second game.This time around, instead of playing as Warren, you get to create your own character, with a choice of background (which has a minor narrative impact), and you can set your gender, customise your looks, and much like any souls game, set everything up to your liking, before you're thrust into the game proper. Enter pandemonium, you start off in a prison hospital where everything is currently falling apart, with rioting in the cell blocks, and something very big and ugly ripping the structure and guards a new one.A much more intricate world than the original, albeit at the expense of the overall sizeMap design in the second game is best described as knotty, the number of shortcuts and loopbacks in each given area is impressive, and you're never far away from a path back to a medbay to bank your tech scrap, or field an upgrade to your power core. This does come at the tradeoff that the maps are more dense, instead of being expansive horizontally, they compensate in being more intricate and expansive vertically, in some places this works exceptionally well such as downtown Jericho, in Port Nixon however it ends up making the area feel somewhat bland and lacking in identity (the port really could have done with being more sweeping). This map design gets remixed at the half way stage once you defeat a specific boss, and the story essentially moves forward in a very permanent way, this refreshes the maps and prevents things from getting boring, but then opens up one of my more definite criticisms of the game. The nanite enemies make a very unwelcome return, and in force, and boy do they annoy the timber out of you. In the first game they were gimmicky, the gimmick here seems to have gone for the most part, replaced instead by absurdly fast, sweeping blow mobs that can, even with heavy armour, four or five shot you. You're going to want to invest in armour upgrades in a big way once the midway point kicks in, and ensure your weapons are up to scratch, because the difficulty jumps significantly.Mechanical improvements all around with perhaps two exceptionsThe Surge 2 has made several very welcome improvements, the drone now works using an ammo pool that can be refilled by killing enemies, and extra ammo can be banked at a medbay (in fact you end up drowning in the stuff even if you drain the clip of the drone regularly), the much maligned weapon skill grind has gone, which given the sheer variety of weapon types has climbed significantly, again, is really welcome. Implants are now all treated as hot swap types, so you can experiment with different build types, also welcome (though the seeming lack of exo-rig upgrades to this point is annoying, the first game allowed for 16 implants max, this looks to top at 12). I've not *finished* the game, so if there is an exo-rig upgrade for more implants, let me know.Less welcome is the directional parry system, which adds a needless bit of fiddling to what is a simple concept, if you block at the exact right moment, you should be rewarded, now instead you have to use the right stick to match the direction of the attack at the right time whilst holding the block button. This is fiddly and with some enemies, a real pain as their attack patterns are too unpredictable to make this work properly. The original parry system worked -fine-, this feels like adding a third wheel to the bicycle.The other complaint is that whilst you can now upgrade implants that provide injections such as heals, you cannot upgrade other implants, this seems like a massive oversight, because that would allow you to fine tune your build. Perhaps they can fix this particular issue, because being able to upgrade one set of implants but not another feels really arbitrary.Closing thoughtsIf you loved The Surge, this is a no brainer. If you love soulslikes, this is a no brainer. The combat is very much of the Dark Souls vein, albeit with a voice of it's own and enough added on top to feel interesting (the original game is still one of my top recommendations for people looking for a change from Dark Souls itself), if you're fresh to the Souls genre as a whole, I'd *slightly* recommend starting with the original, and then moving up to this one once you've mastered the original. It'll make the learning curve a lot easier. But that really is personal preference.Oh, and obviously, if you like your souls with Anime, Code Vein is also there for you. But that review is elsewhere.Verdict: Essential, naturally;Recommended;28.1;26/09/2019;111;4
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;What a fantastic sequel.Even though I preferred the lonely feel of the first game, this sequel is superior in every way.The combat is still awesome. I had a high stamina build and was playing super aggressively, kind of like Bloodborne. Cutting off limbs and looting body parts is still a fantastic and unique way to gear up and really makes this game special. The armor designs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome. Seeing a new enemy always makes you go "oh damn, i want that helmet" You can also do the same thing with boss fights and it makes every new enemy you meet extra exciting. The level design has a TON of variety. Cities, factories, caverns, parks, military camps. They really took the complaints from the first game to heart. The second half of the game can get a bit confusing and you'll probably get lost, but no major complaints.There's a ton of special characters this time and you'll meet some pretty good ones. I especially liked  the Johnny Cage-like washed up actor who decides to be your sidekick. I wish I finished his quest so I can take his cool helmet. It's REALLY cool. Overall, there's a lot more humor and character this time.tl.drIt's an awesome sequel. One of the highlights of 2019. If you enjoyed the first game, you will LOVE The Surge 2.;Recommended;33.0;26/02/2020;72;2
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;I loved the first Surge when I played it on console. Sci-Fi Souls-like which was fairly unique at the time, considering that the game was functional, and scratched that itch. Then a few years after the sequel's release, I finally got my hands on the Surge 2. It is indisputably a better game. The "dismemberment = loot/upgrade mats" thing is the same, the bosses are more interesting, but there's more enemies, loot, and the levels have a higher quality feel to them than the first game's. Not to mention the story is more engaging and cohesive (not to mention its only an indirect sequel, so people who haven't played the first game need not worry about it). It is exactly what it, and every sequel, should be.All of that is why it hurts so much that I cannot recommend this title, and I'm surprised that people do. There is an issue with the game, which has been around since launch. Unlike some negative reviews over bugs or other technical issues, this one seems to be experienced by most players, making it fairly ubiquitous. As part of the game's PC version, a DRM program occasionally runs on computers that are connected to the internet, to make sure you aren't pirating, etc, etc. The issue, for most people, is that this program is unusually CPU-intensive, and often causes the game to drop substantially in frame-rate which, for an action game based around the player and enemies being both reactive and quick, feels really awful, especially later in the game.There are workarounds, and its not game-breaking, but the fact that the developers never changed this, and requires modding or messing with the game's priority settings, etc, means that I just can't recommend it because I KNOW someone who does not have the patience/know-how to do so every time they open the game will quickly come to regret their purchase.Tread with caution.;Not Recommended;10.8;24/01/2023;259;14

Paradox Interactive;Cities: Skylines;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 107,99;This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Positives* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Negatives* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say "100 per week" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.ConclusionIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.;Recommended;155.9;10/03/2015;2,809;90

Paradox Interactive;Cities: Skylines;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 107,99;In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.;Recommended;323.5;19/04/2015;1,431;111
Paradox Interactive;Cities: Skylines;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 107,99;This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.Some of the things worth noting:- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.- This list just goes on and on...The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :PTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them.

Paradox Interactive;Cities: Skylines;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 107,99;For 2 weeks I debated purchasing Cities: Skylines (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, "screw it" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.In a nut shell, Cities: Skylines is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. Cities: Skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Replayability value is here 100%+ Sound effects are great and very life-like+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning. if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, Colossal!+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though+ The "basic" version of Cities: Skylines offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the Deluxe Edition unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshopNeutral± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call Update 26 May, 2016: I've finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC's and I'll provide a brief breakdown. After Dark DLC: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!Snowfall DLC: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. Verdict: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's. If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting After Dark first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with Snowfall since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!Cons- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)---------------------------------------------------------All in all, Cities: Skylines is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive, bravo: thank you for this amazing game.Overall9.5/10If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!---------------------------------------------------------Update 11 June, 2016: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, Colossal Order - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.---------------------------------------------------------Worthy Questions & Answers1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo.

Paradox Interactive;Cities: Skylines;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 107,99;Cities Skylines Review Its been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The "Chirper" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.The Good:========+  Solid graphics and rich detail+  Realistic simulation elements+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings+  Variety of buildings+  Many customization options+  Easy-to-use UI+  Extremely high replay value+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+  Pleasant audio/background musicThe Bad:======-  Lack of random events/natural disasters-  Graphics could be more life-like-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplayFinal Thoughts:===========Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group;Recommended;29.6;10/03/2015;628;20

Paradox Interactive;Stellaris;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 1.131,25;Buy on sale. Buy DLC on sale. Sit down for a thousand hours and question how did it come to this.        I never write reviews, I don't care I just play games but I feel like I should give this one a review.       Pros      - Indepth research tree, probably fineshed it a hundred times, still find excitiment because you can't memorize what tech will come next because it's largely chance.       - Asthetics are great and I forget I'm playing a game, I wake up at 10 Am to play and its midnight before I realize I did'nt do my hw.       - Replayable 110%. No two galaxies are the same.       - Space battles are cool, ss of space battles probably take up 5 Gb of my computer space.       - Ai is interactive and actually does stuff. Although I suspect it cheats.       - Lots of traits, lots of content, lots of options, lots of planets, lots of species, lots of ways to play.       - events make the game more interesting although I keep getting the same end game crisis which annoys me.        - Purge, genocide, slavery, warcrimesCons      - End game lag, fr my biggest problem with the game istg I cant even enjoy playing. I set me resolution to really low and my computer aint even that bad although I suspect its just my 8Gb ram.       - Ai probably cheats, even on ensign (normal) difficulty. Although its just an Ai and you can outsmart them.       - I HATE PLANET BUILDING SO MUCH DOING IT MANUALLY TAKES A BAJILLION YEARS. Ik there is an autobuild but I suspect its the same thing the Ai uses and knowing the Ai it's going to be retarted. If they added something like a planet template where you make templates and paste them to planets that would be the only update I'd ever need.       - They made ringworlds pathetic :(       - Endgame lag      - Lag sucks      - Lag      - Lag      - Minor graphic bugs (dyson sphere showing up half stuck in a star, planets half terraformed show up on the galaxy map in their star system posistions)      - Lag       All of these cons are just my opinion, there is really nothing wrong with this game, except lag. But thats just performance the actual game is the best I've ever played. I've never had so much fun playing by myself.        So you might be thinking to yourself, why the ♥♥♥♥ would I buy this game? Well dear reader if you like purging trillions of aliens then this is the game for you, or you can go a diplomatic pacifist but thats boring asf. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD. 9/10 without lag 4/10 with lag. Would play a thousand more hours but I have to procrasinate for my AP exams.

Paradox Interactive;Stellaris;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 1.131,25;I started off as a bird species on the far edge of the galaxy. Their average lifespan was around 60 years, but they made every year count. They were obsessed with technology, already building their first robots before they had even left their world. Unfortunately, they were immediately boxed in by empires that had emerged into FTL travel far before they had. Their dreams of expanding into distant worlds was immediately and brutally crushed, after their first colony was bombarded into oblivion during in an ill-fated first-contact. Instead of expanding into planets, my people instead built habitats around dead worlds, watching with envious eyes as their hyper-religious neighbours claimed lush, verdant planets. They waiting, watching their old sicken and die, wracked by disease and genetic weakness, while the incredibly long-lived religious neighbours often made it to ages such as 110. Their neigbours scoffed, those Emperors of the Divine. They knew those foolishly materialistic birds could not possibly understand their true purpose in the unvierse. God was on the side of those who hated materialists, after all. Humiliation after humilitation followed, where my people were used in foreign wars, had their new colonies taken away from them, brave colonists literally eaten as delicacies in certain worlds. The bird's hearts gradually hardened, and they began to view aliens with the contempt they so richly deserved. The hatred grew, and the people grew stronger from it. One day, a neighbouring empire, a race of disgusting fungoids, had their fleet annihilated in a short-lived war with an impossibly-powerful ancient empire. Quickly taking advantage of their weakened status, my people quickly turned them into tributaries. The bounty of materials allowed a new phase of expansion for my people, and we colonized 3 new planets. Suddenly, they had become a Great Power in their local area. The religious kings nearby, now the undisputed superpower of the galaxy, continued to ignore them. After all, they were but a gnat in comparison to the territorial holdings of the great Empire. They were soon proven wrong, as in a few short years a massive construction of habitats was implemented across my people's nation. Billions of souls now rested in space, enough to even match the population and might of the Divine Empire. My people continued to advance, their knowledge of cybernetics second to none. Soon, they had a breakthrough: implants could increase their efficiency to the point where they would become the superpower. After a brief teething period, it was done. Every man, woman and child was equipped with the implants. The Divine Empire was horrified, quickly declaring an unprovoked war. But this was not the same bird people as before. Now, their vengeance was at hand. They crushed the forces of the False Emperor, casting him down, and taking his holdings for themselves. The long-lived creatures were quickly enslaved, forced to watch their once great empire collpasing into feuding chiefdoms. Soon, the bird race began to challenge even the ancient empires, building Ringworlds, Dyson Spheres, and even an sensory array that let them see the entire galaxy. Furthermore, they discovered a way to store their minds into an immortal body of steel. This would not stand, the ancient empires decided, immediately declaring war on the innocent birds. Once again, they were quickly crushed, thousand-year old empires grinded into the dust of history. Now, there were only the birds, mechanical gods of the galaxy, encased in empty, undying shells. Every other race was dead, killed in revenge for their cruelty, and their arrogance. A foreign invader came, a biological hivemind from another galaxy. They too, were quickly crushed, and their worlds burned into ashes. The gods built a ringworld at the centre of the galaxy, to remind those fledgling races, just coming into space travel, of the folly of those who came before, then retreated back the edge of the galaxy, content to explore the mysteries of the universe within their massive ringworlds. Time would only tell if the newer races will make the same mistake. tl.dr: Get this game, the stories you create will make you addicted. Please send help.;Recommended;1,086.1;23/08/2017;946;177
Paradox Interactive;Stellaris;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 1.131,25;I went in trying to build an enlightened utopia. With blood and sweat I built a federation, using diplomacy and trade to scramble my way to the top despite warmongers all around me. Then the Unbidden came. My territory was overrun, defenses were wiped out, and my allies began to fracture. But I held on. Planet after planet was wiped out but I held onto my core, building up the mother of all fleets. I lost upwards of 80% of my territory and my stockpiles of resources were nearly exhausted, but I sent forth my fleet in a last glorious charge against inevitability. I cut through tens of thousands of Unbidden ships, fleet after fleet, until I arrived at the doorstep of the Dimensional Portal... only to find that a rival empire had claimed a critical star system and closed their borders, blocking my path. My resources were nearly exhausted, and my fleet was months away from crumbling under its own weight so there was no time to find a diplomatic solution. I declared war. Alas, the allies in my federation were too cowardly to provoke another power while they were still in the midst of pushing back the Unbidden so I had to make a hard decision. I left the Federation that I had built and given everything to and declared war on my own. As my new enemy scrambled and threatened to overrun what little I had left, my fleet Last Hope pushed through the one troublesome system and then to the Dimensional Portal - the genesis of the Unbidden threat that had all but destroyed my civilization. I gave the order and prayed. Before I knew it, untold thousands of my people were dead floating in foreign space, but the portal was destroyed. It was over. Not just the Unbidden threat, but my empire. I had no wealth, no territory, no federation, and my shattered fleet was in no shape to fight a war on its own. Then I saw it.

Paradox Interactive;Stellaris;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 1.131,25;185+ Hours and 3 full campaigns in and I finally feels like I can review Stellaris objectively.Stellaris is a 4x grand strategy game from Paradox. So I kind of expected a Civilization in space kind of game (Like Galactic Civilization 3) which isn't a bad thing since I love 4x games. But what I got was something different. a 4x, grand strategy, customizable, nearly open-ended RPG. And that is where this game sets itself apart from all others in the 4x field.Campaign 1 – Since everything was new I tried to chose things familiar. Humans, warp drive, materialist, individualist, etc... While I found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics I was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation. Eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power. With the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighbors, over-throw a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders. More than once I found myself wishing for more victory conditions, and when I started feeling like it was getting a little stale I pumped out a crap-ton of colony ships to meet the domination victory condition (owning 40% of habitable planets). All in all a good run.Campaign 2 – Within 5 years I had encountered a Fallen Empire and they hated me from the beginning, instantly declaring war, which I immediately had to surrender. A couple of years later I met ANOTHER Fallen Empire and THEY hated me. I was playing peaceful, scientist, cat people... Maybe everyone was allergic because everyone, even regular empires, kept insulting me, threatening me, and declaring war on me until I was finally curb-stomped into a chunky red paste. What did I learn from my violent and abusive loss? Better influence and sector management techniques. Campaign 3 – Military Dictatorship using wormhole generators to move. What a difference a little experience makes! Never once during this campaign did I find myself struggling with the influence mechanic and working with the oddities of the sector mechanic have become rather easy. Fallen empires treat me as a child in need of patience, enemies avoided my vast fleets and my economic power was unmatched. When one of my rivals triggered a galactic wide robot uprising, all I needed to do was put all my robot populations to death and outlaw AI. Easy peasy! Later when I stumbled across the robot capital world I invaded with a genetically engineered xeno army, killed all the robots, and had  a beautiful Gaia world all to myself. Of course I had no friends, allies, trading partners, or anything else. Sadly, I started getting a little bored so I again jumped to a domination victory.Currently Stellaris is the tale of three games:Early game – Brilliantly fun and engaging! Lots of events that change depending on your pre-game choices, lots of 4x fun, and lots of role playing make the early game really enjoyable and re-playable.Mid game – Lots of repetitive management is required with not a lot of new game content occurring. Being a warmonger can certainly spice this part up but that may not be everyone's cup of tea.  Late game – Some very interesting galaxy wide events/disasters occur and the rise and fall of some of your neighbors keeps some interest. However, the lack of more victory conditions does make things drag a bit.Overall I love, LOVE, this game. Does it need more victory conditions? Yes. Does it need more mid game events? Yes. Does it need better tool tips? Yes. Are wormhole generators the greatest thing ever? Yes!One final thing to keep in mind is that the Clarke patch is about to release which will fix a lot of the sector issues and questionable AI decisions. And the future Asimov patch will address the mid game issues. Which means that things are going to keep getting better so I highly recommend this game to everyone.Edited to Add:Wow! The Clarke patch hit and what a change!Midway through my fourth campaign and suddenly, after load, the sectors started actually producing, science costs reduced slightly, fighter and bomber groups became wildly effective, federation partners began fighting their own battles (a bit), other empires asked for (and offered) safe passage through their space, diplomatic requests began to pour in, enemy AI combat decisions became much smarter, and all the frontier outposts I had been hiding in sectors to avoid influence costs grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, bent me over a log, and yelled “squeal like a pig!”What a massive improvement!The future Asimov patch is still needed for mid game content, but if you were waiting to buy Stellaris, well wait no more. It is even better now.;Recommended;352.9;28/05/2016;798;83

Paradox Interactive;Stellaris;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 1.131,25;I decided that my first Stellaris playthough would be on Ironman mode, with no prior knowledge of the game whatsoever. What follows is three of the most interesting points in a campaign that has thus far spanned 180 years.Background:I named my empire "The Galactic Empire" and began the game as a militarist, materialist, and authoritarian.The Celimy Conflict:Early on, around the 50 year mark, I encounter a species of strange, fungal creatures. They call themselves the "Celimy States". They are fanatic spiritualists and pacifists. Fools.After a series of insults and the declaration of a rivalry, the Celimy declare war on me.My navy, christened the "Grand Imperial Navy", departs the Coruscant System to engage the Celimy "Mycelium Carriers", as they called themselves.A short time later, the Imperial Navy reaches the Celimy home system. Imperial transports land armies on their capital.The takeover is rapid, and at the end of the war the Celimy States has splintered into 3 separate nations: The Celimy Hegemony, the Celimy Confederacy and the Celimy Associates. Later on, the Associates would become my vassal. The Confederacy was a long standing enemy.The Galactic Civil War:Around 120 years in, the galaxy is almost fully filled with about 20 separate empires, and two distinct sides begin to form.On one side is myself and a federation called the "Stellar Entente", along with various other small empires.The other side is comprised of a vast array of small nations, led by the "Karabnar Nations".War breaks out, with the Karabnar declaring war on the Galactic Empire.I now have 3 fleets: The Star Corps, the Shock Battalion, and the Grand Imperial Navy. The Star Corps and Shock Battalion are relatively small shock forces, whereas the Grand Imperial Navy is my main force.A massive space battle in the Ocheron system involves over 1000 ships, with almost every known nation being present.The battle (which was beautiful to watch) was relatively even until the arrival of the Star Corps and Shock Battalion, who tipped the balance with fresh ships.The combined fleet of myself and my allies (yes, the AI is THAT good) eventually reaches Karab, the Karabnar Nations capital, and takes the system with the help of two Titanic Beasts recruited from the outer systems of the Empire.On the verge of victory, I am notified that a massive fleet is currently in orbit over Coruscant. Sent by the Hjaarthi Syndicate, one of our enemies, the fleet is in position to take our homeworld. My own fleets cannot reach Coruscant in time. All seems lost.A mere few days before Coruscant's fortifications would've failed, a fleet from one of my allies, the Verulian Compact, comes out of hyperspace above Coruscant and annihlates the enemy fleet.The Karabnar Nation and their allies surrender, and the war is won.The Fallen Empire (150 years in):A fallen empire (which is a fully developed but stagnant state) exists above me. They call themselves the Yz'Vorak Remnant (which I shortened to Y Remnant).They are military isolationists, and hate my empire with a special intensity.They insult mea and shortly afterwards declare war on my empire. This sort of war is usually a death sentence, so I move large numbers of people away from the Frontier and prepare to submit.At this point I've got 3 vassals. All are weak, but they are extremely loyal. The vassals join me in the war.All 3 of my fleets meet above Coruscant, along with Transports for my Droid Army (Irony, much)I deploy my entire military to the Jahab system, where we meet the Fallen Empire's forces.Their ships are unlike anything we've ever seen, and are incredibly powerful. We are losing the battle. Things are not looking good.Suddenly, out of hyperspace, come 3 fleets. my 3 vassals have brought everything they have to assist the effort. With their help, we drive back the Fallen Empire forces.Fastforward about 3 years.Through intense naval strategy and economic strain, Imperial forces have out matched the Y Remnant's fleet. The Grand Imperial Navy and the fleets of my vassals orbit above their capital: The Core.I don't have enough strength left to invade their planets, so I offer them a white peace.Fallen Empires cannot build new fleets, so this seemed logical enough.I recieve a notification:"Peace Accords on Coruscant"While signing the peace accords on Coruscant, two V Remnant agents who were standing next to the Emperor (of the Galactic Empire) killed him and mutilated his body.Furious, the Imperial Navy and the combined fleets of all of the Empire's vassals and allies immediately attack the Y Remnant Capital.Out of nowhere, a massive army from the Fallen Empire comes out of hyperspace over The Core (I still am not entirely sure where this army actually came from).In the epic battle that ensues, the Grand Imperial Navy defeats and destroys the Y Remnant's fleet, allowing the ground invasion of The Core to take place.With The Core fallen, the Fallen Empire cowers and begs for peace.The Y Remnant is annexed by the Galactic Empire.Peace reigns across the galaxy.Around 20 years later...Subspace energy surges indicate something we have not encountered before. A new being from out of our dimension makes contact. Their signal is not unlike a hunting call.....BY POPULAR REQUEST, AN UPDATE:Their name is the Unbidden and they make an immediate point.A transmission appears on my screen, depicting some kind of strange, ethereal being.They say something about prey and then the transmission cuts out.The Unbidden fleet is marked by science ship in the bottom part of the galaxy, below myself and the "Qix'Lufran Combine".The Qix'Lufran are isolationist authoritarians, but decide to deploy their entire fleet, the sole largest fleet in the galaxy, to immediately engage this extraterrestrial threat.The Qix'Lufran fleet reaches the Unbidden's position, and is utterly destroyed.This shocks the entire galaxy.Interestingly enough, these "Unbidden" would remain effectively dormant in their small region at the bottom of the galaxy. Not sure if it was because of the Fallen Empire bordering them, or simply because they were waiting for reinforcements. Either way, the Unbidden hold their position for the time being.The Great Intergalactic War:The Galactic Empire has become the most powerful and largest state in the galaxy. Above us, the "Hjannarthi Syndicate" exists, which nearly equals my own power. To our left is the "Stellar Entente" federation. To the right is the Njalax High Kingdom, and the Uriy Republic. Below us, the Zuifvan Imperium, the Qix'Lufran, and the Unbidden.Although there is a period of peace, there is great unrest in the galaxy.The Qix'Lufran and Njalax grow closer and closer every year.Eventually, they declare a defensive pact and close their borders to myself, the Stellar Entente and the Hjannarthi Syndicate.Their combined power rivals my own. they are dangerous.They undergo a combined massive military buildup, and begin to become increasingly aggressive.In mid july of 2412 (212 years in) the tensions boil over. The Njalax and the Qix'Lufran declare war on the Galactic Empire, the Hjannarthi, and the Stellar Entente. The galaxy is divided.A line is drawn essentially down the middle of the galaxy, dividing the left(Qix'Lufran and Njalax) from the right(Galactic Empire and Allies).I issue an immediate order to deploy the fleet. The long dormant Grand Imperial Navy assembles over Coruscant.Admiral Cognat leads the navy.My ever-reliable vassals send everything they have to join the Imperial Navy. I love those guys.The Stellar Entente's federation fleet strikes first. They use their wormhole stations to attack directly at the heart of the Njalax.My own fleet reaches the Qix'Lufran capital with relative ease, meeting almost no resistance.We confront a vastly outmatched Qix'Lufran force of 2 battleships and 18 corvettes.

Paradox Interactive;Crusader Kings III;RPG, Simulation, Strategy;R$ 179,99;It has taken me several years to like and get into Crusader Kings 3. It's a complicated & intriguing game which always left me cold when my ruler died - as your precious realm is split apart by partition.Recently I found a historical focused youtube series by 'Realm Builder Guy' (I highly recommend) who introduced me to the 'secret' of enjoying Crusader Kings:You are not there to build & defend a nation (a modern concept). Your role is to further your noble House influence and legacy, to bring stability and prosperity to your lands. CK3 is about Dynasty, not empire.When I stopped trying to power-game the system, stopped frantically acquiring territory in a race to make a larger Kingdom, stopped making stress decisions 'out-of-character' for an advantage, the game started to click with me. Instead of jumping in trying to manage an entire Kingdom, I chose a humble English Earl in 1066 and spent 40 years tending to my family, my faith and the needs of my people.  The Pope granted us several Duchies from the heathens in Wales and suddenly we were a Duke. I had rivals, friends and a benign King who I served faithfully. It was completely absorbing.  So that's my main advice for new players. ignore the huge kingdoms and the Irish tutorial, play someone small and navigate that persons life. Don't sweat your realm splitting up on death, focus on the wider picture of your House glory and the long game becomes much more compelling. - Signed, your faithful servant Duke Cato of Powys, Defender of the Faith and Guardian of Warwick.;Recommended;230.3;9/06/2023;562;12
Paradox Interactive;Crusader Kings III;RPG, Simulation, Strategy;R$ 179,99;The year is 1176. I am playing as Alberto, King of Italy and Tuscany, and holder of many other titles. Events are progressing well. I am well on my way to my ultimate goal of creating the Empire of Italia, bringing Italy, Corsica, Sardinia and Croatia under my heel. As Alberto I have used my stewardship ability to build up the power of my realm to rival the Papacy, my next target. I fully intend to pass on a legacy to my son and heir, Sinibaldo, a promising child of many talents.It was my occasional practice to grant titles to my children. This always carries the danger of them falling victim to some battlefield accident, but I sleep better knowing those titles are in the hands of close family. Sinibaldo has his own dukedom and is waging war on my vassal Duke Ugo, who is not a family member but who is a true ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The war does not go well for Sinibaldo and he becomes a prisoner of Duke Ugo. An unfortunate event, but surely he will simply be ransomed and we will all move on with our lives.But several months later I get the shocking news: Sinibaldo has been executed! My only son, struck down at the tender age of 14 by the vile Duke Ugo--how can this be? I am enraged. In the heat of passion I move to revoke Duke Ugo's title, but he rises up in rebellion against me. The impudence! As I rally my troops the true extent of my mistake becomes clear--my other powerful vassals have also rebelled. With growing desperation I realize there is no path to victory. My last army is destroyed and I lose the war, my kingdoms stripped away, I am deposed.I lean back in my chair and think about the rash idiocy of my actions. My son dead, my titles gone. I now have to play as my daughter and heir Benedetta, an eleven year old girl. It is time, I think, to pull the plug on this game.But what of Duke Ugo? Can he be allowed to go on, after the vile murder of my son? No, I must bend every effort to see him brought down. And so I forge on.As Alberto I had paid little attention to my daughter. Her guardian was some knight or other, and under her tutelage she had become rowdy, a warrior in a world of men who would never accept her as an equal. This, I thought, did not bode well.As Benedetta my reign was immediately disturbed as the vassals of Tuscany formed a faction to remove me as Queen. But wait, this faction wanted to install a new king in place, none other than my own father, Alberto! I suddenly realized that as his only child, unless he fathered another male heir I would inherit his titles upon his death and once again the kingdoms of Italy and Tuscany would be part of the same realm. And so when the faction presented its demands I simply capitulated. Alberto was now King of Tuscany and I was Queen of Italy.Yet my power was still not enough to challenge the evil Duke Ugo. To keep him close I appointed him my steward, but I also sent my spymaster to dig up dirt in his court.Years passed. I got married, had children, quashed several rebellions, organized my realm and bided my time. When a Crusade was launched I led my troops against the infidels attacking my cousin King Mario of Jerusalem, returning in triumph and finally impressing even the most retrograde of my male vassals. The waifish eleven year old girl had become a warrior Queen.But Ugo continued to plague me. As my steward he was often in my presence, always there to remind me of his evil treachery. I hosted a feast and there he was again, even trying to strike up a friendship! I coldly refused him, and he became my rival. The stress of dealing with him was almost unbearable.And then the miracle--my expert spymaster had uncovered gold. Duke Ugo was a deviant!This changed everything. I now had the key to bringing down my brother's murderer. But it must be done carefully--Ugo was still powerful, and I could not take him down as long as he and the other vassals of my realm opposed me. So I only blackmailed him, getting a strong hook that I would use to ensure his loyalty while I consolidated my position.In 1211 I received news of my father's death. After the messenger left my chambers, I went to the family shrine and knelt in prayer, vowing to my father's spirit that his son, my brother, would finally be avenged.More years passed. As both kingdoms were now mine, I slowly amassed enough gold and troops to take on my entire realm. A careful campaign of pacification had made my vassals compliant.It is the year 1218, and time to put my plan into action. I expose Duke Ugo's deviancy. He is now a criminal. As my father did twenty years before, I revoke his title, and again, he rises up in rebellion, but this time no one will stand with him. My troops outnumber his four to one. With laughable ease I storm his palace and win victory. My knights drag him out and throw him down in the mud before me.I arrest him and throw him in the dungeon. I revoke all of his titles and grant them to a distant toddler cousin. Years of emotional stress are wiped away in an instant--Ugo, my rival, murderer of my brother is now mine to do with as I will. Shall I torture him? Execute him? Shall I simply leave him there to rot in filth and misery? I ponder this choice, and the sweetness of vengeance.;Recommended;3,845.6;1/04/2022;576;72

Paradox Interactive;Crusader Kings III;RPG, Simulation, Strategy;R$ 179,99;Coming into CK3 as a longtime CK2 and EUIV player, I was slightly concerned about the content and playability of CK3. After all, CK2 in its initial stage was very limited, and it was through the course of very many DLCs that fleshed out CK2 to what it is today. CK3, being brand new, and (rightfully) with no expansions, felt like it would be in danger of being a pale imitation of its predecessor. However, now with over 40 hours in CK3, I can safely say this game lives up to everything that CK2 brought to the field and more! The UI is much, much more intuitive and new player-friendly. Furthermore, content that was added over a long period of time through expansions/DLCs like India and Tibet are in the game right off the bat and immediately playable! There are also many new, welcome mechanics, at least for people like me who like to roleplay their dynastic legacies or 'jump ship' so as to speak. Let me explain!To start myself off in CK3, I decided to go with an old favourite, the Magyars. Leading the fore as Almos, I led the Magyars to migrate into the Carpathian Basin, snatching it from Bulgaria. Following this, I attempted to conquer enough lands to reform the Taltoist faith, but combined pressure from the Carolingian Kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire led to the death of Almos and poured cold water over my dreams of reformed Taltoism. As Almos's son, Arpad, I turned Catholic, and used 'holy war' as an excuse to conquer all my heathen neighbours despite being pagan just years ago. With Hungary formed and its borders secure, Arpad finally passes on. As the 3rd-generation King Szonuk, I noticed Bavaria was no longer in the hands of the Karlings, thereby breaking their tripartite alliance. I bide my time, building prestige, formed alliances with West Francia and the Byzantine Empire, and proceeded to invade and conquer Bavaria, creating the Austro-Hungarian Empire centuries before its supposed to exist. As Szonuk dies and my 4th-generation Arpad II takes the throne, I notice I am, in fact, able to claim the West Francian throne for my mother. So I invade my former allies without further ado and put dear mum on the throne. As my mother passes on and the throne of West Francia comes to my greedy little hands, the Austro-Hungarian Empire has surpassed even Charlemagne, and stretches from France to Hungary. My son, Szonuk II, through careful eugenics, is a genius, and my grandson, Arpad III, a HERCULEAN genius! Nothing can stand in our way now!But wait. A killer roams the castle. I am shocked and horrified to discover my herculean genius grandson dead. Dead before he even has a chance to fulfil his glorious legacy. I vow to find the killer myself. Clearly, it must be a Karling loyalist, or maybe even a Byzantine spy trying to undermine my power. As I investigate, I get ever closer to the truth... and then receive a letter, from none other than the killer! The killer says they have been living under my nose this whole time, and that the truth will only bring me pain. I push on nonetheless... I must know the truth! And when I confront the killer... its...... My son, Szonuk II! Why?! How?! it's your own son! My grandson! I am aggrieved. I disinherit him and put him in jail immediately. My successor changes to one of my other, more virtuous, less kinslayer-inclined sons. As I ponder what to do with my insane genius kinslayer of a son, the Pope's messenger arrives. A crusade, he declares, is to be launched into Jerusalem. Being the pious Emperor that I am, I of course, agree. To my surprise, my son qualifies as a beneficiary of the crusade, due to being disinherited. Hm. So be it. I free him from jail, force my son to be in the frontlines as a knight, and send him off to lead the imperial armies and hopefully die a virtuous death despite living as a sinner. The crusade against the Abbasids goes swimmingly. Too swimmingly. In a twist of fate, my sinful son becomes monarch of the holiest kingdom, Jerusalem itself. Well. So be it. He'll probably die defending the holy city once the Abbasids recover and launch their counter-assault. I have no inclination to help him. So, I click past the notifications, and...... I accidentally click "I wonder what kind of King he'll be?" And now all of a sudden I'm the kinslaying villain disinherited by the Emperor, and sent to be king of a forsaken holy kingdom that i have no chance of holding. With a single demesne, with all my vassals and everybody in my family hating me because I'm a kinslaying nutjob. FFFFF-Just as I consider ragequitting, I figure... Hang on, this might be the most interesting character to roleplay as yet. A kinslaying, lunatic-genius exiled from home and sent to die fighting for the cross to atone for himself. So I lean into it. I become the most insanely fanatical holy king ever. My first order of business is to imprison and revoke the titles of all my vassals from the contributing houses of the crusade. Now my demesne is full and my coffers are slowly filling up. Then, I befriend the Byzantine Emperor, bribing him with huge amounts of gold, most of it given to me by the Pope despite my lunacy due to my renowned piety (thank you, Your Holiness!) and swaying him with my evil charisma. I see that he has three sons. I marry my daughter (thank god I didn't kill YOU too) to the youngest matrilineally. Now we have an alliance. With the aid of the Byzantines I survive in the land of the infidels, and slowly expand by absorbing the smaller Islamic emirates around me, never lifting a finger and simply burning prestige to let the Byzantines do their thing and wipe out my enemies. Following this, I systematically kill off the very helpful Emperor's older sons. The first murder goes unnoticed. The second, unfortunately, is traced back to me. The Byzantine Emperor is very understandably heartbroken and furious with me. So I assassinate him too. Now my son-in-law is Byzantine Emperor, and he hates me for killing off basically his entire direct family. Sure, understandable. I check my daughter and see she already has two sons born to our house. Cackling madly all the way and out of my mind with stress, I commit suicide. Now I am my daughter. Over the years, I watch as my husband drinks himself to death, leaving the Byzantine Empire to my oldest son, who I groom into another herculean genius. By the time I pass on and play as my son, the Herculean Genius, Hungarian Catholic, Byzantine Emperor and King of Jerusalem Szonuk III, I look to the west and see our ancestral legacy, instead of imploding like I thought, has remained intact, and blossomed towards England and Scandinavia as well. As I look at the sea of Arpadys covering the map, I vaguely realize I've recreated the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. What can I say except 10/10 game.;Recommended;250.2;14/09/2020;822;136
Paradox Interactive;Crusader Kings III;RPG, Simulation, Strategy;R$ 179,99;After my main character, Emperor Illiya of Italy, a drunken fornicator and heretic, was assassinated while attending a ceremony, I switched to his grandson, Emperor Astore of Italy, who took to the throne at the age of 25. Astore was born of two white parents, yet suspiciously looked to be of partial African descent. Despite looking nothing like his "father", he still managed the Empire much better than his predecessor. His sister, Agostina, who also looked to be half-black, ruled the neighboring Empire of Francia. Because the realm split when Iliya died, they both had a strong claim on their respective empires. Despite this, they both considered each other great friends. And the comfort of this friendship helped Astore greatly after his firstborn son was mysteriously murdered. As an emperor, he was known to be extremely generous and kind. He helped put down many rebellions caused by his "grandfather", and restored much of the land which had previously been lost. By the time Astore was 75 years old, he had lived a long and content life. It all came crashing down, however, when an extremely old man offered to give Astore a secret in exchange for a favor. Expecting the secret to be some mundane thing, such as some man from India having slept with one of his courtiers, Astore reluctantly accepted the offer. However, the secret was nothing less than the true murderer of Astore's son: Agostina, his only sister, best friend, and faithful ally. Betrayed, Astore declared war on the 80 year old Agostina, shattering the alliance. The war waged for 4 years until she was eventually captured and executed. The fact that such an incredibly elaborate and detailed story can occur without any script whatsoever is amazing, and earns this game's acclaim.;Recommended;1,013.2;1/05/2021;767;38

Paradox Interactive;Crusader Kings III;RPG, Simulation, Strategy;R$ 179,99;In the year 931, my sister and lover was murdered by my friend and brother-in-law. He burnt her at the stake with my babe in her belly. He was a powerful man, my sister married well, his family spread far across Europe with many of his kin in the most influential houses of the developed world. I spent the next 350 years erasing everyone who shared his blood, starting with my niece and nephews. By the time I was done, his family was erased from history, lost to obscurity and time. All my focus and hatred had left my own family nothing more than a poor Duke, so heavily consumed by a hate he didn't understand that by the time it was all over he took his own life before he fathered an heir. Thus, I lost my own family to obscurity and time.After gaining nothing and losing everything I pondered for a moment whether or not it was all worth it...

Paradox Interactive;Europa Universalis IV;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 143,99;A rather complex grand strategy game, you pick a country to control starting from the year 1444 all the way to 1821. There isn't any fixed objective to aim for: it's  a good idea to try to get the achievements offered (such as world domination), as most are a real challenge to earn. Each country is divided into provinces, allowing movement of you armies from one to another in real time - nothing here is turn based. Battles aren't controlled by you, as in total war: you make your army walk onto the same province as an opposing army, and the battle outcome is decided in part by random dice rolls, and in part by factors you can influence, such as generals, terrain, morale of troops. The same can be said for naval battles, where different types of ships behave differently depending on what sea province you are fighting in, if they are in the open ocean, or in a closed sea (such as the Mediterranean). Diplomacy is fairly well fleshed out, countries can have a number of different governments, such as feudal monarchies or merchant republics, all that give different bonuses and maluses, and some (such as republics) offer the possibility to choose what type of leader you want, so as to give you more of a certain type of monarch points. You can offer alliances, royal marriages, support rebels, create false claims on provinces you don't own to give you a "casus belli" (a reason to go to war) among other things, the list is really really huge.Monarch points are a "limiting factor" in the game, you have 3 different types of monarch points (Administrative, Diplomatic, Military), each that serve different purposes. For example, military points can be spent to buy a new general, or to treat a province harshly if rebels are likely to rise up there. (As of the Art of War update, rebel mechanics have changes slightly. Instead of each province possibly spawning rebels depending on a percentage, now each rebel faction has a counter that goes up or down depending on your country's stability and province modifiers, such as nationalism, culture or religion. Once the counter reaches 100%, multiple stacks of rebels spawn). Other points can be used to change your capital, annex vassals, gain provinces in peace deals, create buildings and much more. The gain of monarch points depend on your ruler, that can give from 0 points each to 6 point each month. By spending some of your income, you can also hire advisors, that can add to your monthly monarch points income, and grant you some nationwide bonuses. Trade is also a large factor in the game, you have merchants and you can choose to send them to various trade nodes, and you can choose if you want them to try and collect money from that node with a malus, or to send the money that you collect upstream, to a different node where you can collect from. Having colonies and trade agreements with other countries helps your trade income, while being embargoed reduces your trade in nodes that the country embargoing you controls. As of the "Common Sense" update eu4 has a revamped fortress mechanic, given out for free. Now fortresses are placed in various provinces in your country (you can also choose to build them once you have the money), and they exert a "zone of control". Provinces without forts on them are very easy to conquer while in war, while provinces with fortresses on them have to be seiged or assaulted to fall under the attackers control. Forts now block enemy units from advancing, allowing the defending nation to have some space to reorganize and prepare defences, while the attacking nation has to carefully choose how and where to attack so as to lose the least amount of troops. Unoccupied forts also have a "zone of control": If you conquer a province next to a fort, but leave the fort to itself, the fort will free any occupied neighbouring province while at war. I love these changes, especially if you play a large nation, as it adds a whole extra layer of strategy to how you build up you nation's provinces.Paradox has created a lot of DLC for this game, but with each DLC comes a vast amount of free content as well, so it might be advisable to buy the base game before buying DLC, so as to see what you think about the game before commiting too much. If you choose to play online with a friend that owns the DLCs, even without owining the DLCs yourself, the game activates them, so its possible to try them out before you buy. It would also be a good idea to try and watch a tutorial beforehand (Arumba on youtube comes to mind), as the game doesn't do a great job of explaining all it has to offer. It's a very time-consuming, and occasionaly frustrating game, but I found that the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it: I'm constantly learning new things I can use to my adantage, and the game is becoming more satisfying due to that.;Recommended;175.9;5/10/2014;1,005;23
Paradox Interactive;Europa Universalis IV;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 143,99;After playing Civilization 5 for quite a long time, I have started to become interested in a deeper gameplay with deeper political consequences, better religions, and more interesting colonize mechanics I couldn't do in Civilization. Of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for Civilization, but a new game, where everything is new, is fresh and exciting.So let’s shall begin with topics I want to "review".Music Most of the times are peaceful songs whistling in the background, but the music dynamically changes when going to war with another country, which is trying to boost the morale of the player, which usually works. The weird part about the peaceful songs are, that they are somewhat forgettable, but will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week later.DLC’s There are many... Way too many DLC's that did come out for this game.Luckily they are usually units getting a better design, for 2€ each so you are not missing out on too much. The ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on. For example the "new" DLC "Conquest of Paradise" enhances the colonization mechanics which were, at the beginning of the game, a bit lackluster, but more on that later.Countries The country’s themselves are from the year 1444 to 1821, the interesting part about them is, that you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to start, that means you can play against revolutionary French as Austria or play as Portugal to colonize the new world.AI The AI has a certain points of intelligence made out of preference, there are militaristic, diplomatic, passive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time. That is, until you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course. The human player gets treated just like an AI to other AI's, if you conquer they will hate you, if you don't have any alliances they are going to attack you, that's why there's that certain point of risk of alliances with the AI, which can make your AI ally to an enemy faster than you might think. Just never trust them too much...Ideas The idea system is a way to put more of your own preference into the country that you are playing, there are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific country’s, 18 group ideas for country regions (like Italy) and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas. That sounds like a lot, and it certainly was a pain for the creators, but it was well worth it. It gives most of the countries just their own specialty. But I'm not going to go into that sort of stuff.Colonization The new made colonization concept is a simple but innovative one. Get exploration ideas, Colonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created. The colonial vassal is just like another country, but he has to pay taxes and can't attack you. You can control these taxes on your own, but never set these taxations too high, because you know what happened with the USA and Great Britain at that time. Independence wars definitely can get a strain on you, if you know that you have to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to fight a war.There are certainly way more things I could try talking about, but I just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interested, especially the fighting mechanics and monarch points, but I don't want to tell you everything. There is that certain interest I wanted to awake in some people, so that they are going to try this game for themselves, and not get ultimately bored because I just told them everything of the game.For most of the people the Price is going to be the main issue with this game, 40€ certainly is quite a lot in the steam shop, but that's why special sales exist. If it's getting 50% off I can definitely recommend it.The game managed to keep my interest for other 265 Hours now, and hasn't even bored me a bit so far.It's probably a game what you are going to get in touch and love it, or try it and hate it.I hope I managed to get some peoples interest, and if you are still reading this, thanks for reading my first proper review. It means quite a lot to me.MfG Artjom;Recommended;875.5;8/03/2014;626;2
Paradox Interactive;Europa Universalis IV;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 143,99;Let's start off with the assumption that you've never played a grand strategy game before. You've seen pictures, watched videos and heard great tales about map painting, and it peaked your interest. You end up here, for whatever reason, opening your wallet, ready to throw some money at Paradox for Europa Universalis 4. Great, you've made a fantastic choice, depening on how you look at it, on how willing you are to learn.If you are like me, you'll probably open it and click on the tutorial button first thing. You're probably going to give the tutorial a few shots, before saying "screw it" and closing the game, going back to doing something more productive, like watching youtube and playing other games. All is well, then a dark thought comes to light, "got to conquer the world", and you're right back at it, you open the game, playing through the tutorial all over again, and again. You check up some tutorial videos and maybe check in on a wiki or forum, just to be sure.You feel like you have learnt somewhat, the very basic mechanics there is to learn, and you feel ready to take on the world! Or, at the very least, a few bits here and there. Booting up the game, you feel the excitement, ready to click on singleplayer, the world at your disposal. Chances are, you'll probably pick a nation synonymous to your native country, or at the very least, something similar. You look at the map, there it is, your nation. Looks different, yes? Because it is.Now, we got a couple of interesting starts if you don't fancy your own, not because it probably is a small and weak country at the time, no, you just fancy playing someone else.Looking at the best starting area for beginners at this game, Europe, we got quite a mess going on. Germany is in shambles, France and England are at it again, the Ibearians are finishing off their reconquista and Austria is being an overprotective Emperor. Denmark is just being a nuisance, Muscovy starts map painting right off the bat and the Ottomans are consuming the remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire. Now you ask yourself, why on earth would I start in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the answer is simple, you start in it, or it comes to you.Forget the middle east, the Ottomans will devour you before the end of the decade and after the Ibearians are done with their deed, they start cutting down some, cutting down on the "re" in reconquista that is, haha, starting the conquista of all Northern Africa, and if that doesn't stop you, the Tunisian-Ottoman alliance will.You turn to Asia, more specifically India. Now this would be a great choice, if you were familiar with the tech mechanic and how to deal with it. Either way, after recent patches, you can now also get some sweet red, blue and yellow paint spilled all over you, Great Britain, France and Spain, that is.Unless you can conquer all of India by the time the Europeans start with their charter companies, you're in deep trouble as a beginner. Your neighbouring nations in India or Indochina will sell out their provinces to filthy rich Europeans, giving them more of the good stuff, trade income. Once they get a taste of that, you can bet that they'll be all over you all the time. Not to mention, if you're really unlucky, Ming, also known as China, might just get there beforehand, at least you can escape them if you play in Europe.You want to start as Ming you say? Go ahead, enjoy your constant tributary wars and attrition. Doesn't really matter, you got the money and the men to keep that going for a millennium. Don't though, before you're a true warmongerer, diplomat and rebel supressor you're probably not going to last for long, tech penalties, hordes and rebels will start your demize, and the colonizers will finish it. It's an easy nation, but get used to the game first with some more stable nations instead.Start off in Africa and you're going to be a subject to a major European power before you know, you'll be their stepping stone to India and other colonizable areas. If that's something you fancy, try it. You probably won't enjoy it though. It's no fun being annexed and or vassalized by Europeans.Which brings us to the Americas! You're excited about trying to play the solo game, the chill game? Don't, leave. You're going to hate it, and a pro tip, never play in mesoamerica, that's just you embracing doom on your own. You don't want to start in the Americas already, you're hardly familiar with the game mechanics, or the native mechanics, and not ready to take on the smallpox that will be brought in from the colonizers, much less their troops.Well, that's the startes for you, roughly. You also got the steppe hordes, however handling with Muscovy can be problematic. Though, if you want a game mainly focusing on land, not having to worry about pesky liquids and ships, then Muscovy is for you. Here it's all about taming the steppes and conquering as much to the north, south, east and west as you possibly can. This can be a great step after you have learnt the basics of combat, and you feel comfortable taking on the Polish-Lithuanian union with a small taste of a Danish invasions to your north.Well, who to start as? Like many would tell you, as I will, start as Portugal, Castille, England or the Ottomans. With Portugal you get to chill and get used to the game's mechanics, one of which is colonizing, and that will benefit you greatly in the future. You don't have many enemies to deal with with the exception of the natives, so you get somewhat trained with the combat mechanics. You'll get to experience how the navy functions and how colonization affects your trade to name a few. ((Trade is important))This is the same with Castille, except you're in a stronger position, especially if you manage to keep France at bay and Aragon alone until you get a personal union over them. England is also a good start, as your navies are the strongest in the game at the start of the game. However, if you are completely new, I suggest surrendering the land of mainland europe to France, so to avoid the annoyance of having wars declared on you, letting you focus on the British Isles and colonizing in peace.The Ottomans is a great start considering they are one of the most powerful nations when you begin. You have a lot of small nations around you so you can get used to sieges, core-cost, war mechanics and the like without many nations caring to stop you. Be careful however, you might be powerful, but a coalition of Austria, Hungary and Poland-Lithuania might be too much for you to chew, and once that starts, the Mamluks won't waste any time stabbing you in your back.Now that you've settled down in a nation my rambling is almost done. The things you should focus on now as you start is technology, alliances, miltary tab and all its small numbers, armies, navies, trade, goods, states & territories. Focus also on your nations ideas, and try to pick ideas that will build upon the ones you already have, or things you plan on doing in the future. As Portugal, exploration ideas works as a starter for colonizing, and as Muscovy, religious, quantity or humanist ideas will work. These ideas on Muscovy is based on their need to expand quickly, thereby manpower, or all the heathen religions they'll have to deal with in the steppes, thereby religious, or thanks to the new religion state updates, humanist ideas will suffice.I do not have more room for text, so I'll end with this. You'll notice this game has a bunch of DLC. Yes, too much one might say. These aren't needed by a beginner by any means, and bring for the most part really great quality of life things into the game, as well as some really cool new mechanics, such as great powers. You can look through each one and decide on which one you feel would fit you the best and buy one or two as the time goes. I would not recommend buying it all at the same if you've just started, bad idea. There are lots of things to get into already without the DLC.;Recommended;3,711.5;19/10/2018;234;19

Paradox Interactive;Europa Universalis IV;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 143,99;If you're going to buy it, just buy the base game, then roll it back to an early version- say 1.5.1. You can do this by right clicking on it in the library, properties, betas, and select it from the drop down list.Don't try playing it at its current level without DLC- it's just frustrating. Don't spend £100 at sale prices on DLC in the hope you'll like it, unless you have money to burn.If you do this and decide you do like it and want more content, then pick up the DLCs in the order they came out, and roll the version you play forward to match. Trying to play later versions without DLC is just not a fun experience as the game balance is calculated on the basis of having the DLC, by in large. Quite a few people who've played thousands of hours are running older versions of the game for this reason- if you fall two or more dlc behind then playing becomes less pleasurable, so you end up paying- hence the frustration at paradox's dlc policy- or roll back. Be aware though- if you're planning on playing multiplayer, you'll need to be playing the same version.I've played Europa Universalis since the original, and love it, but does seem harder and harder to recommend on account of the cost- particularly the hiking of prices in less afluent parts of the world. Expansions for EU3 certainly had more content for the money. At the moment though it is still worth buying and starting off slowly on if you think it might be your thing.

Paradox Interactive;Europa Universalis IV;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 143,99;Never thought that a strategy game would be the most thrilling gaming experience I have.But scrupulous, hour long planning and carefully forging alliances and marriages, while keeping an eye on which direction rival countries are sending their diplomats to, because one wrong move can turn your plans to dust, is much more addictive than you might think. The relief you feel, after a long term plan of yours is finally set into successful motion, is not describable.One of the few games where careful planning and thinking is actually rewarded. No simple rock-paper-scissors battles like in other strategy games. Even though my enemy may have the bigger and more advanced army, I might have won the war through logistics already. Everything that needs to be said about this game, has actually been said already, but I just can't pass on the chance to show my appreciation for it. I'm +90hrs in, and I'm still finding new ways to play this game, everytime I start it up. It's complex, deep and rewards the player that thinks on a larger scale. One of the best purchases I made in years.;Recommended;165.7;7/11/2014;409;23
Paradox Interactive;Europa Universalis IV;Simulation, Strategy;R$ 143,99;** Edit: June 18 - Launched the game for the first time since writing the original review. **I have become so disappointed with this game. If I had not watched all of the dev clashes I would assume that the devs for this game do not play or understand this game. I am just shy of 4k hours in this game. I hunt achievements in this game. I've played almost every nation, in every sphere and I've learned a lot about the world as this game will pique my interest in a topic and I go and look it up on my own, I understand that this game is based on history, not a carbon copy. This game ignited a love for geography and history in me. So when I tell you to save your money, believe me. I get every DLC on release and race to get those new juicy achievements. Baring some Budgetmonk and Flurryworry level game play, I've pretty much done or attempted it all. Leviathan deserves every single negative comment it receives. Every down vote should be doubled. This was a dagger through the heart of an ailing game. A mercy bullet to the head. Over the last few years Paradox has done a sub-par job in producing content for this wonderful community and wonderful game. This patch is a disgrace. Here are some reasons why:** This has been hot fixed as far as I can tell ** - Lag - This game would never lag before, I play on speed 4 and pause all the time. Up until this patch you could scroll across the world as your game ticked away days with no performance issues at all. Your HRE vassal swarm would crawl across Asia into China with no issues at all. Now, you have to pause the game if you want to move your camera lest you want to lag. 4k hours on the same PC and it has never, ever lagged like this before. - Pillage Capital - What a massive game breaking mechanic. This mechanic single-handedly has ruined this game for me. It is an interesting concept but in execution it is absolutely terrible. By 1490 as Pegu I had a capitol province of 60 Dev, and I'm sure there are people who had theirs higher. There is a requirement in the Age of Revolutions to have your capitol at 50 dev, this used to mean something. Now everyone can have that done in 40 years from game start instead of being done with 80 years left in the game. By the time I was finished my run I had over 270 dev in my capitol and that was only the mid 1600s. What a joke. North American and Aborigine tribes soar above 50 dev with ease and that's still pre 1500. Was this even tested? How did this mechanic make it through? - Favors - Wow.... Just wow... Favors used to be a road block in this game. Let's use my game as Garhwal, an OPM in India, as an example. When I did the 52 Garhs  achievement it was pre Emperor patch, I had to pull a lot of stops to get Jaunpur as an ally and then I had to wait a long, long time for my tiny nation to be able to build up the favors to call in my attack dog. Curry favors has made this an absolute joke. Expanding the favors aspect of the game sounds good on paper, but wow was this ever poorly executed. If you choose to still play this patch then you need to have an ally the entire game as they are just another source of free money and soldiers. In many situations any injection of cash is hard to come by, random events or they cost you a war. Now? just wait until you have 10 favors and every 5 years your get a % of your ally's treasury. You can even take a piece of his manpower pool, one of the most important bottlenecking resources in the early game. ** This has been hot fixed, file now works ** - Game Breaking Crashes - This is the absolute piece de resistance of this patch. In my current, well now dead, campaign I wanted to use the new broken mechanics of pillage and favors to help me get an achievement I've been after for years, African Power and the Fetishist one to go with it.  Everything is going my way, colonizers are scared of me because its 1545 and I have half of Africa under me and my capitol is massive. I spawned colonialism and this game is just smooth sailing, finally I can get these done. Lo and behold, no I cannot. With my auto save at Sept 1, 1545 that is the end of my run. When I unpause the game it goes until Sept 5th and crashes. Over and over again. I found out that the literal file for the save is full. Just over 100 years from start date the file has no more room and cannot write beyond this date. Incredible. I type this negative review with such a heavy heart. I feel like I'm having to put down my family dog because it bit the neighbors kid. I loved this game. Finding this game on steam was one of the best moments of my life, as lame as that sounds it's true. This game inspired me to learn. Now all this game does is inspire me to look for something else to do. Shame on you Johan, shame on you Groogy. I know you know what you've created is bad, but it's so much more than that. You let the glorious game you worked so hard on for so many years fall into ruin. Rome has fallen to barbarians, the great city has been sacked, things will never be the same again. It will take more than a couple hotfixes to revive this game.;Not Recommended;5,922.6;23/05/2021;396;12

After building up I thought it'd be nice to have some friends and wanted to buddy up with the mighty UK. They didn't want me in, thinking I'm too weak and pathetic. Then it all began. I swore vengeance on those damn imperialist. I began to plot my revenge. I hired a fascist demagogue to change my ideology while rushing nuclear research despite the massive penalties. After a succesful coup, or as it will be known in Luxembourgian history - unification of my people under one banner I joined the Axis since both Germany and me had mutual enemies. With their help I was able to unite the Benelux region under my rule, gaining more precious factories and people to force into my legions. I helped the mighty Reich in conquest of France, being rewarded with another small chunk of land. Everything was going according to my plan. But then a certain Austrian thought it'd be smart to attack the USSR. At first everything was fine, but then, oh god... Then the blasted British landed troops in France. So here I was facing the hordes of imperialist pigs while my best pal was off in Russia causing havoc. But I knew what I had to do. I had to stall them as long as  possible, and that I did. Eventually Italaians and few Germans came to help and the British advance was slowed down or even halted at times. Good, good, just a bit more time. I'll show those islanders how "weak and pathetic" I am. I'll show them. In late 1944 the first nuclear bomb was produced. But I couldn't drop it without air superiority, so I waited and built up more airforce to help the Germans win the air war in the regions. And the help I provided proved very significant, the might Luxembourgian air force dominated the skies and allowed me to drop my revenge. Oh what a wonderful sight it was to see London in ruins.

Devolver Digital;Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number;Action, Indie;R$ 46,99;I feel the need to make an actual review for this game, because too many positive reviews for it are just memes and can be overshadowed by the more comprehensive negative reviews.Hotline Miami can be tough to talk about, because Hotline Miami 1 was such a hit that this game will always be compared to it based on HM1's merits alone. The original game was about a masked serial killer who got mysterious phone calls threatening him into carrying out hits on mob locations. The whole story was pretty strange and trippy, with very little being what it seems. The gameplay was super fast and hectic as you ran around scavenging whatever you could find to beat the brains out of the army of mafia waiting in the buildings. The combat was close quarters-oriented with some enemies with guns, but mostly melee focused. Each mask had different abilities that affected your starting weapon, or gave you abilities like killing punches or spawning more guns as random pickups. All in all, it was a fairly good game with all of this. The reason why I didn't really like Hotline Miami 1 was because the AI was actually fairly buggy and reacted either very sluggishly or hyper-quickly, without reason. The level design was very tight, and due to the ridiculous speed of everything, it felt too hard to control. I would finish a level and feel like I'd gotten lucky.Hotline Miami 2 managed to fix a fair amount of the problems with the first. The combat is slowed down somewhat. Guns  fire slower, melee weapons swing slower, and the level design is more open, allowing some more freedom of movement (the combo meter also lasts longer naturally). The result, in my opinion, is that the gameplay feels much more tight and controlled. The weapons swings feel like they have more weight to them, guns kill much more effectively, and the levels feel less restrictive. However, I've seen a lot of people say that they felt the opposite, and that they were driven more towards using guns because there are more enemies with guns, so melee is now useless. In the same vein, people hated the more open maps because they felt that there was a tendency to get shot from off-screen by an unseen enemy, or through glass.I would say that Hotline Miami 2 is somewhat less casual than the first, which is why I think so many people feel that it's too hard. I bought both games together, and after I finished 1 I jumped straight into 2. The difficulty spike is noticable. it's been stated by the developers that it was primarily geared towards players who'd played the first game and knew how it worked. That being said, I didn't find it too hard to get into the groove of Hotline Miami 2. I died a ton at the start, and really all the way throughout, but it never felt like I had died due to BS game design, but rather my own mistakes or miscalculations. I think HM2 is meant to be played with a bit more planning in mind. You can rush in and fight, but it doesn't usually go well. However, it's also not like you need to plan your every move. You just need to observe enough that you know what you're about to get into. From there, it gets much easier. I said earlier that I felt like I'd gotten lucky when I'd finished a level in HM1. In HM2, I had felt quite the opposite. In each level, once I knew what I needed to do, I felt like I was much more in control. I finished levels and felt satisfied, without the tinge of anger or the "I just got lucky that time" feeling.As for the gameplay problems: There are definitely more guns, and the gameplay is more gun oriented, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that melee play is impossible. To be honest, it felt the opposite in HM1. guns felt out of place, and, in many instances, rather ineffective. I feel like 2 strikes a better balance, even if it seems to favor guns more. Many levels still can be played with melee weapons, it just requires, as I said earlier, some more patience and planning. You just need to know what you're walking into. As for the glass panes and off-screen deaths: I've encountered the first, but not the second. There are, once again, more glass panes for enemies to shoot you through that in HM1, but that is always a two-way street: You can just as easily shoot them better as well. As for the off screen deaths, I have almost never, at any moment in HM2, died to an enemy that I COULDN'T have been able to see. What do I mean by this? Well, the camera obviously places the most emphasis on the direction you're facing or trying to look. Whenever I've been killed by an "off-screen enemy", I've really just been killed by one that I couldn't see because I was looking the wrong way, in a sense. It's easier to notice if you look at gameplay of it. The only exception to this are the crouching gun enemies which pop up when the player is in their line of sight, becuase they have a huge sight range for some reason. They alone are the enemies that can kill you before you can see them. I think all of the other enemies have about the same ( or a bit less) of the sight range of the player. What about the more open maps? Well, I'm mixed. Some maps are straight up huge, but they actually aren't that hard to traverse and fight through. Others, particulary Hard News, Blood Money, and Takeover, are unforgivably open, and cannot be played easily without guns (or really at all for Blood Money). But otherwise, as big as some maps are, you can still play through them using melee. Act 5 in particular is a sort of throwback to HM1's more frantic style with somewhat more restricted maps and lots of melee enemies.The story of HM2 is also something that some players don't like. I don't want to go into it, because there are some big spoilers, but I will say this: HM2's story is far more lucid than HM1's. It's told in a style which constantly switches characters, which is why it seems harder to comprehend, but it's actually fairly easy to piece together if you're observant. Several characters have stories that directly link to HM1, as the story is anachronistic (is that the word?) and takes place before, after, and during the events of HM1.As for the character abilities: HM2 is definitely more restrictive in playstyles than HM1 in some instances. Few characters/factions have the option of different abilities, but those few abilities that do exist are all very unique and varied. There's one character that can do a dodge roll, another can carry two SMGs. Yet another disarms all the guns he picks up, making him more melee based (see?) but can go rage mode if you kill enemies instead of knocking them out. Some characters have no abilities, and those are personally my favorite, because they have the most open and unrestriced gameplay (as some characters are stupidly restrictive, such as the Fans). The soundtrack also rocks, because it's less ambient than the HM1's. In HM2, the soundtrack carries far more weight and fits the scene better, and is never repetitive.So that's basically all about Hotline Miami 2 (thanks for sticking around this long). To be honest, The best way to experience this game is to buy it with the first as a combo pack (it only adds $5 to the price of just HM2). That way, you can play both games, experience both playstyles, develop your own opinions, be better prepared for the challenge of Hotline Miami 2, and better appreciate the overall story (which is actually really interesting). That's basically all I have to offer.;Recommended;246.4;19/04/2016;365;4

Devolver Digital;Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number;Action, Indie;R$ 46,99;Having played 28 hours of this game, I've decided to tell you why I think that this game is worth every cent.Obviously, It is absolutely imperative that you play the original game BEFORE playing this one.Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a game developed by Dennaton Games and published by Devolver Digital and serves as the sequel for Hotline Miami, a "A hyper-violent top-down shooter/brawler" and one of the most critically aclaimed indie games of all time.The game takes place after, during, and before the events of its predecessor and manages to maintain some of the frantic action that popularized the first game, HOWEVER, Wrong Number is much more story focused than the the original and serves as the developers way to tie up loose ends.The gameplay retains certain aspects of from Hotline Miami but the levels are designed in such a way that you have to cower in fear behind each door and wait for the perfect moment so as to not get either snipped by a shotgun from across the map or spotted through a window.I, like most people, didnt enjoy this kind of level design, because there are enemies outside your camera's range who can react faster than you and end what seemed like a perfect run.One of the aspects the latter didnt retain from the former was the melee combat. In this game, melee combat was somewhat nerfed, making the melee swing slower and the and the range smaller.One of the most controversial characteristics of Hotline Miami 2 is its relatively large cast of playble characters. But Haplop, how could more characters equal less fun.Well for starters you have more characters but less unique playstyles. There are 27 masks each with their unique gimmicks and playstyles opposed to the 14 characters of Hotline Miami 2. Whats more is that there most characters dont add anything new, here's whats new.Fists of Fury,(used by 2 different characters), lethal punches, cant pick up any weapons, wich renders it sorta useless since the levels are so big.Dodge Roll,(used by 2 different characters) you press space to dodge in the direction you are pointing and become invincible in the mean time, can sometime cause you to miss floor executions.Chainsaw and Guns,(unique) you control one of 2 sibllings wich (the one rocking the chainsaw), with your right mouse button you force the second sibling to shoot. The AI on the second sibling can be kinda buggy, and will sometimes become stuck behind walls while you charge inside a room full of mobsters armed to the teeth with nothing but a chainsaw.Two machine guns, (used by 2 different characters) you start with 2 smgs, you can have 64 bullets and can only reload once, after that, there is nothing special to it.Start with a nailgun,(unique)- 24 nails, silent killer, nothing out of the ordinary.Inner warrior,(unique) Fists of Fury with nunchucks.Remember the Richter and Aubrey mask from the previous game? They now grant no special abilities.There is also a character wich instead of killing can incapacitate and disarm foes for bonus points.You also get to play as a soldier wich can switch between a knife and one of for weapons ( a rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle and a flamethrower) but cant pickup any other weapons.The soundtrack is just downright beautiful featuring the works of El Huervo, M|O|O|N, Perturbator and many other independent artists, it can go from slow and melancholic to full on assault in seconds and it really does not only live up to the standards set by the previous game but somehow also manages to surpass them by a pretty big stretch.Not only that but the audio in general is really descriptive and the mushy sound of grey matter splattering all over the room does add to the gory factor of the game, wich by the way, makes great use of the Hitchcock effect (google it)The sprites may seem a bit, how should I put it, wonky (?) at first but after playing through it you realize that it is one of the best way to convey to the player the setting of Miami's 1980's. Overall the game in itself is great, the gameplay isnt as satisfying as that of the 1st game but the story is beautifully written. Its a much more down-to-earth game and the story always has you feeling sorrowful and melancholic while still keeping you interested and engaged as you watch this immensely dense plot unravel before your eyes while you cant really do anything about it.I guess that that is what really gives you a sense of accomplishment, once you manage to get the bigger picture that is.So...Do you still like hurting other people?Let me know if you agree with this review or not.;Recommended;44.2;14/09/2015;278;17

When the two players are too far away from each other, this can lead to movement-blocking at the end of the screen or enemies are off the screen and you have to guess their position (This is not a huge CON, after all, you have to get the camera working for COOP somehow).;Recommended;257.4;23/06/2017;181;6

Devolver Digital;Katana ZERO;Action, Indie;R$ 46,99;Framing is an oft-overlooked element of game design. Sure, you can slap bullet time or save points into your game without explanation, but making them part of the narrative can provide unparalleled immersion for even the most outlandish titles. That’s what makes games like Katana ZERO such rare joys, the fact that every single element of the presentation is tied to the narrative and mechanics. From your time-bending powers all the way to the VCR you select stages on, this intense, bloody journey builds layers of meaning and intrigue around a single, compelling core: getting through this neo-noir hell with as much style as possible.In the rain-slicked streets of a grim neon city you arrive, clad in but a bathrobe and armed with only cold Japanese steel. The voice on the other end of your phone wants you to kill everyone in the strange factory you find yourself at, a simple task once you start slowing down time to the point where you can deflect bullets with a sword. Room by room you expunge all life almost effortlessly, painting the walls with blood from an impossibly quick blade. When your task is done you return to your hovel of an apartment, your nightmares, your appointment with that voice on the phone, your neighbors, your demons, your rivals, your doubts, your fears, and the truth.To say anything more would be to spoil one of the most intense and twisting narratives you’re ever going to get from a platformer, one that I’m going to be mulling over for days if not weeks. Your hobo samurai has a lot of people interested in his mysterious combat prowess, while at the same time you get to play through vignettes of his life as an attempted citizen. There’s often more drama in these little glimpses of city life than in the machinations of war and government he’s caught in, thanks to some excellent writing and world-building. Just the way factions from the war are mentioned, or districts of the city, or famous figures is enough to make the setting pop in a way that few games can.More than this, though, is how the brilliant dialog system puts you right in the center of the story. It’s one of those where your responses are on a timer, and you must make your dialog choice before time runs out. However, most choices also give you a tiny window at the start where you can interrupt the person speaking. Interruptions can lead to wildly different paths through the dialog, and sometimes affect gameplay beyond that. And it’s all done in lavishly colored animated text that floats over the speakers, highlighting key terms for emphasis and shattering on interruptions. Just when you think you’ve seen everything Katana ZERO does with this mechanic, I assure you it will find a way to surprise you.That’s really the beauty of this one across all its features, that it will never stop surprising you. Every mechanic and detail will eventually get used in a way you didn’t see coming, and that happens most frequently in the action itself. As a godlike samurai assassin, you have only your sword and your reflexes to dispatch goons, swordsmen, armed security, and worse. But you can slow down time to perfect your moves, roll past deadly attacks, reflect bullets with your blade, and sling objects like bottles and vases to neutralize distant threats. Each room must be perfected before you can move on, like little bite-sized Hotline Miami levels strung together in a mounting crescendo of murder.But here again, Katana ZERO excels in the details. The action you are partaking in, the ritual of attempting, dying, and attempting again, is framed as the planning that your bathrobed terror does before actually executing. Once you have perfected your plan, the game replays the room for you as if on a security tape so you can witness your exploits at human speed. This is a key framing mechanic, and one that the plot centers on in a big way. And even this will defy your expectations in incredible ways, ways that make the game all the more engrossing as you battle your way through it.I cannot stress enough how polished every aspect of this title is, either. The pixel art is absolutely lush in its animations and special effects, making you feel ever strike of the blade and hitch of the video tape playback. The sound design matches the intensity of the action, and the soundtrack is some absolutely killer synthwave and soulful tracks that carry the neo-noir stylings to new heights. There are moments of levity, like the cosplay dialog options and Strong Terry, and moments of intense dread. There are beautiful vistas, and rooms caked in gore. It’s an incredible ride from start to finish, and I assure you that you’ll be left wanting more at the end of your 4-hour (or so) journey. Katana ZERO has a vision and it stops at nothing to express it, blending style, substance, and action into one of the most cohesive packages I’ve ever seen.Did you enjoy this review?

Devolver Digital;Katana ZERO;Action, Indie;R$ 46,99;I'm on a quest to find out whether this game is better than sex.EDIT: Had sex, the game is better.EDIT 2: So here's the actual review. I won't focus on reviewing just the game, but rather focus on the area that does not get talked about enough, which is speedrunning the game (the reason why I have half a thousand hours in the game). The game is exceptionally good at speedrunning, it's both easy to pick up and extremely satisfying to continue striving for even better times. Why ? It's because the gameplay is both satisfying and hard, and it only gets more punishing as you incorporate even more challenging ways of completing each room. A few more reasons why it's great to speedrun:- Barely any RNG present when speedrunning (besides the motorcycle section, but the dev promised that he will make this section RNG-less once the DLC comes out) and the RNG that is present only accounts for a few seconds of time variation, so that basically only matters at top level. As such the player's skill is the only thing that matters if you beat your personal best time or not.- The run itself is mostly gameplay, there are no cutscenes that you have to sit through and waste your time (there are like 3 instances total of the player needing to wait ~10 seconds in the entirety of the run).- Most rooms are challenging to speedrun, and each one have ways of improving time. There aren't many situations where once you learn the particular room it stops being challenging or it's impossible to shave off further time (exception being the final boss and autoscroller in doom, but a doom skip has been found for one of the autoscroller parts, so that's epic)- The runs are short, at top level they only take 15 minutes to complete, this means that you do not have to focus for extended periods of time.- The game is very easy to setup for speedrunning, you don't need to setup an external program to keep track of time, since there is an in-game timer.- The dev actually listens to our requests and will change some stuff once the DLC comes out.- The speedrunning scene is active, so pop into the speedrunning discord server and ask your questions.So if you're interested in speedrunning the game, check out the guides section of the game's speedrun.com page. If you have never speedran a game before, give it a try, this was my first game that I speedran and it's a blast, give yourself a challenge first of obtaining a gold medal (~30 min range speedrun), and if you found it to be fun, aim for a sub-20 min run next.;Recommended;1,141.7;28/11/2021;308;163
Devolver Digital;Katana ZERO;Action, Indie;R$ 46,99;I pirated the game and played it from start to finish, and then bought the game. that's how good the game is.;Recommended;4.5;25/06/2019;492;230
Devolver Digital;Katana ZERO;Action, Indie;R$ 46,99;Katana ZERO is a highly immersive cyberpunk/neo-noir (I honestly don’t know the difference) cross between Ninja Gaiden and Hotline Miami. Albeit incomplete and short, this game oozes high quality production from start to finish. my only hope is that the continuation/future updates will manage to maintain this level of quality. I also want to mention that this genre of games usually doesn’t interest me, so this experience was a very pleasant surprise. A big thank you to dworry for recommending this game! Played with PlayStation 4 controller✔️Positive:[+] Attention to detail in combination with creative and intelligent design choices makes Katana ZERO an incredibly immersive experience:We need to talk about how extraordinary the dialogue is.Yes, the writing is good, but the way that dialogue was presented is what really blew me away. The developers used a myriad of animations to incorporate “voice acting” in the text boxes without the use of voices at all. By changing things such as the speed of text appearing, and animations and colour of certain words or phrases, you get a very strong indication of the tone of dialogue. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163734569 Furthermore, you are offered dynamic dialogue options that change during the countdown. You can choose to take your time to select your most appropriate answer, or quickly and rudely interrupt whoever is speaking (emphasized by the shattering of the text box). Naturally, your answers/actions have an impact on the direct conversation and the course of the story. Katana ZERO may not be the first to incorporate these designs but they managed to execute it masterfully. Superb attention to detail. There are multiple examples of this but I will focus on the details that I found really added to the immersion:(a) Random entertaining NPC encounters that juxtapose the gore and other mature themes that run rampant throughout the game. You can also pet a cat.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163733927(b) Mundane actions such as burning your kill contract or drinking your tea at the end of a mission have to be triggered by the player. It may seem silly but the simple act of interacting with a tea cup actually transmitted through the screen and helped me relax after the high-intensity segments. (c) At the start of the action sequences, Zero (main character) takes a moment to put on earphones and turn on his music cassette, which in turn cues the in-game music. As an added bonus, the music is amazing. [+] Easy to learn, hard to master type gameplay with the right amount of difficulty.In short, you can move like a ninja and are equipped with the ability to slow down time, dodge roll, slash your sword and throw certain objects. The time-manipulation is certainly overpowered but is not indefinite (used up like stamina) and is counterbalanced by the fact that Zero has no health bar. every mistake is fatal and will cause you to reset the room. Each level requires a balance between good reflexes, wit, tactics and adaptability. Optional unlockable swords aside, you do not obtain any new abilities during the game but instead get better at managing your time-manipulation ability to deal with increasingly complex situations. While this is usually not my preferred type of game, the progressive difficulty made for a very enjoyable, yet challenging, experience. ➖Neutral:[-] Compelling but incomplete story. Katana ZERO does a great job at balancing high intensity encounters with appropriate down-time moments and still manages to organically merge in hints of the backstory. However, the story is currently incomplete and has left me with more questions than answers.[-] Given all the buzzing and fizzing effects, this game is indubitably the worst nightmare for people with photosensitive epilepsy. It’s clear that the developers are aware of this, since they included a warning directly upon launching the game and also the option to turn it off. Since I do not suffer from epilepsy, I chose to experience the game as intended by the developers but found that it was a little too buzz-y and fizz-y for my taste.[-] Each room has a countdown timer to encourage a high pace but there were very few instances where I felt pressured to finish the level. Perhaps the developers were too generous with the time given? This may not be the case for hard mode but I don’t know from personal experience.❌Negative:[x] Short. My first blind playthrough took approximately ~3 hours, and then an additional ~2.5 hours to explore alternative paths and endings. Upon finishing the game, hard and speed run modes are made available but I am more interested in experiencing the rest of the story. As far as I know, the developers have promised more content, so (hopefully) there will be more to look forward to! 🏅Verdict:★★★★☆ A fantastic startKatana ZERO is currently an incomplete experience but shows a lot of potential. Despite thoroughly enjoying the game in its current state, I am slightly hesitant to recommend it at this moment. However, at the same time, the game shows enough promise to justify my faith that the rest of the game will be just as good (or even better?). The satisfying gameplay and immersive story form an excellent base to what might be an exceptional gaming experience.

Devolver Digital;Carrion;Action, Adventure, Indie;R$ 59,99;Carrion was one of those purchases that had me excited to play even before purchasing it. The chance to finally play the monster in a horror game was something that had me on the edge of my seat in excitement. At the start of my play through I played very stealthily, nurturing the monster, letting it feed and grow. As the play through progressed and my monster became stronger, I began to seek out humans. Looking through every room, consuming every bit of my kills. Near the end of the play through I was a mass of destruction. No creature or machine retained their lives. I was fast, and I was merciless.  At the conclusion of the game, I realized I had played something much more than a game. It was a magnificent piece of story telling and drama.

Devolver Digital;Carrion;Action, Adventure, Indie;R$ 59,99;Hi, this is my review for CARRION. This review is SPOILER FREE. I liked the game a lot.GameplayCARRION is a 2D game that plays unlike anything I've tried before. Every mechanic in the game, from combat, to puzzles, and even basic movement is fresh and unique. In spite of that, you might be surprised at how natural it all feels. And it doesn't stop with mechanics: I've played a LOT of nonlinear side-scrollers, and when it comes to level design, this game has them all beat. Every arena presented many opportunities for distinct combat strategies, the puzzles were all incredibly well thought out and used the player's abilities in surprising ways, and the way the maps managed to use old rooms for new things whenever possible never ceased to amaze me. Serves as an inspiration to me as a puzzle designer, level designer, and game designer.One thing to note: most "metroidvanias" are 2D-platformers. This game, however, I would not consider a platformer. It opts to use puzzles as a means to keep the player engaged during lulls in excitement, rather than platforming, a decision that I am all for. Worth keeping in mind that the game is not necessarily for people that are specifically after a nonlinear platformer.CARRION is also not as long, and doesn't contain as many branching paths as some of my other favorite nonlinear games. although I would not say it is too short, and the content it does present is so consistently awesome and innovative that its quantity isn't of too much concern.Narrative and VisualsNarrative wise, CARRION is rather sparse, yet the mysterious atmosphere was enough to keep me interested in what was going on. Throughout the game I was left wondering, which isn't a bad thing.When it comes to art, the game is beautiful. The sprites are nice, particularly the player character's, but where CARRION really shines artistically is in its environments. The way color and light are used to make different areas stand out makes what might have been a generic or repetitive "underground lab" setting compelling and diverse. Absolutely phenomenal game overall, a bargain at full price.EDIT: Read some other reviews, saw people suggesting a level editor, and all I can say is YES PLEASE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.;Recommended;62.9;23/07/2020;190;4

Devolver Digital;Carrion;Action, Adventure, Indie;R$ 59,99;Sum-UpIn-depth analysis further down.🟩 Pros🟥 Cons- A unique twist on a tried-and-true premise. fresh and innovative.- Excellent level design that enables multiple approaches to most encounters, and has enough mechanical variety.- High-quality art direction: it fully, visscerally conveys the terror, brutality, powerlessness during an alien outbreak.- Enjoyable progression system that constantly opens up new opportunities and ways to deal with obstacles.- The total absence of a map, united with a labyrinthine stage design, makes backtracking for secondary content an obscure and frustrating process.- The lore and story overall feel underwhelming, not elaborated enough upon. Many questions remain unanswered without any clue. May be a stylistic choice, but I call it wasted potential.🟨 Bugs & Issues🔧 Specs- Very limited graphical options, without even a dedicated resolution selector.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:It took me 5 hours to complete CARRION, taking extra time to explore all areas accurately. The content is linear and there’s no reason to replay once finished, or any additional mode.Is it worth buying?Yes, on sale. The normal price of 20€ is quite steep for only 4-5 hours of content without replay value, despite the very good overall quality. If you find a decent discount (20% or better) by all means, get it.Verdict: Very GoodRating Chart HereWell-polished and with a unique perspective on an otherwise overused trope, CARRION is a high-quality experience with only a few moderate flaws drawing it back.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853059852In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingIn the depths of an advanced research facility, glass shatters and vents are forcibly opened as a mysterious alien entity - as in, you - makes its escape from captivity. Driven by the primal instincts of survival and reproduction, but also capable of highly complex reasoning, this amorphous mass of writhing tentacles, razor-sharp mouths and flesh globs will be yours to command through the facility’s intricate bowels, shielded by all kinds of security systems.CARRION is set almost totally in an underground complex. Despite this fact there’s a surprising variety of landscapes and locales, that range from underground lakes to advanced labs, production lines and even verdant forests. Remarkable attention was put into crafting each area, with the entity’s passage leaving marked signs like blood, destruction and mangled corpses. The feeling of wreaking havoc, instilling fear in the scientists and security personnel is vivid and palpable thanks to this style choice.On the lore side CARRION reaches only sufficient levels. This title uses indirect narration almost exclusively, with flashbacks, environmental hints and some cutscenes forming the totality of the info provided to you. The NPCs won’t talk to each other (could you understand them if they did, though?), there are no lore files, videos or anything optional to shed more light on the fragmented, obscure lore surrounding the entity and its origins. It feels like a missed opportunity to make some interesting background alongside the present events.Exploration & PuzzlesThe enormous, intricate base is divided in sections that will progressively open as you spread your progeny in specific points i’ll call Nests. These places act as save points, heal your wounds, and progressively weaken the armored doors that lead to other sectors. The explorative process is linear, with the entity being able to tear down doors, gratings and other obstacles. For several of them though later upgrades will be needed. you’ll be heavily restricted about where you’re allowed to go early on.Some small secondary areas diverge from the main path, and they contain one of nine containment capsules that grant minor passive bonuses. While this incentivizes exploration and is also tied to a few achievements, it also constitutes a very annoying process: there’s no map, and the layout of the base gets more complex at every newly-discovered sector. It will be a true nightmare to navigate zone after zone in the search of that minuscule opening or transition that leads to a coveted optional area.The proposed puzzles won’t be overly-complex, and will mainly revolve around activating switches in the correct order, or using the correct form at the correct times. Because yes, the creature has three different forms with unique powers, and you’ll be able to absorb the flesh of the dead to boost yourself, or deposit biomass in specific locations to “downgrade” in order to access powers you may need in that particular moment. Using these as core mechanics, the puzzles feel interesting and are well-engineered overall.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853060114Combat System & UpgradesBetween guards armed with guns and flamethrowers, personal shields, heavy-duty armored robots, turrets and traps, the facility was engineered to prevent something like your escape from happening. At first you’ll be able to grab human enemies and toss them around, or eat them to gain biomass when possible (the guards’ armors prevent you from doing so, and you can’t consume machines). As you break more and more containment pods, you’ll gain more offensive and defensive abilities like spikes that instantly kill organic enemies they touch, harpoons, invisibility and more. Some of these skills are very powerful, and require energy gathered from electrical sockets in order to be used.The way you choose to approach combat is up to you: you may pick off enemies one by one and retreat to a dark corner when spotted, or risk it all and go all out, throwing desks and corpses to incapacitate multiple foes at once to then finish them. Generally the stealthy ‘divide and conquer’ approach is the safest and kinda what the game is designed around: stronger enemies like robots and guards won’t be so easy to take on, especially in higher numbers, until much later on. In case you get killed, you’ll restart from the last Nest you stayed at, with the world reverting to that point in time as consequence.That being said, the variety of enemies kinda winds down in the latter phases, with no stronger foes to match your increased powers, especially when you reach your final form and all upgrades are unlocked. If you expect an epic final boss fight, well there isn’t one either, don’t get your hopes up. I kinda expected an epic last stand of the remaining security for5ces to prevent your escape at the entrance, but this just didn’t happen, sadly enough. In any case the combat has a meaty, violent feeling to it that really conveys the animalistic brutality of this organism the ‘right’ way, so props for that.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853060358;Recommended;5.0;24/08/2022;188;3

Devolver Digital;Ape Out;Action, Indie;R$ 46,99;APE OUT is a masterclass in game design. This is a small package, but is bursting with clever design decisions and pure unadulterated addictive action. APE OUT is first-and-foremost an arcade score chaser, with a short yet interesting campaign that intends to showcase a series of different ideas. Each idea forces you to adapt and even rethink how to go about things. And every idea in here really works. The artwork is nothing short of brilliant, and is used in many creative ways. For example, the second Disc skyscraper blew my mind. I just loved that. From the color palettes to simple-yet-clear textures to that wicked camera angle - it all creates an exhilarating atmosphere. Moving on. This title makes one of most creative uses of music that I've witnessed in ages. Maybe ever. Yes, it's nuanced and small - but also genius. I was sold with just the jazz level, and then it changed! That marching band 3rd Disc is powerful stuff.  But then we have some more nuance. I was watching the developer live stream, and they made some interesting comments. They mentioned that the rooms don't actually make sense because that's probably how it would feel through the eyes and mind of a confused and rampaging ape. Same idea for how everyone would appear to be an enemy. Now this is also a convenient narrative to excuse proc gen - but I don't care because it's also wildly interesting. And the proof is in the pudding - if there is one thing that is undeniable about this title - you truly do feel like a confused and rampaging ape. You only need the edge of your seat for this one.Pros:+ This is a brilliantly designed game.+ The way the music is implemented is not only as fresh as it gets, but it both sounds outstanding and pairs perfectly with the gameplay.+ This is very addicting.+ Leaderboard support is awesome.+ I find there is a good bit of strategy here. definitely less twitchy than some of it's comparisons.Cons:- We could use some QoL options like the ability to adjust volume while playing.- When I use windowed mode, or really change any resolution settings it usually crashes and logs me out of Steam. I've learned to just not touch things.- The main 'game' is quite short. While what is present is fantastic, maybe they could have added in a bit more. And then again, maybe it's good that it doesn't overstay it's welcome.This is the first great game I've played in 2019. Worth full price.;Recommended;8.0;1/03/2019;135;3

You have to fund lackluster development with "Pre-Alpha" exclusive monetization and drip feed players the content. As if that wasn't bad enough, they decide to remain closely involved with the community, releasing updates regularly, even while developing another game? These guys are killing the established order of things! How are developers supposed to keep up? What, are they expected to just "make games"?

Techland;Dying Light;Action, RPG;R$ 50,99;Glad to see the misinformed reviews have been thrown out of from the top page. For those who have said that Dying Light's day/night mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesn't actually change in the game clearly haven't played past the intro missions. The first two missions are obviously there to get you started, so they're not going to thrust a timed day/night cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanics, and thus in the intro missions, time does not change if you don't progress the quest. Past those two missions, day/night becomes very real, and incredibly terrifying. /endRantGameplay:I'm sure it's been said before, but this is what Dead Island should have been. Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid. Running around is great fun, and jumping into abandoned houses and exploring/finding loot is constantly fun. And this is where I got caught in my first night phase. I was running towards my objective when "oh look another shelter, let me go secure it," then "oh look there's an air drop nearby, let me go grab it," then again another shelter nearby, on top of random houses and zombies (sorry, "biters") to loot, and before I knew it, I got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick (mind you, the Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get home, but I just have to keep scrounging for loot). I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelter, so I just booked it. This is where freerunning gets exciting. With how seemless and smooth it is to run around/through buildings and across rooftops, the run to my shelter didn't feel annoying or like a chore, but more like a challenge to find the smoothest route (very similar to Mirror's Edge). Long story short, night fell, I ♥♥♥♥ my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftop, listening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter. I've since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a quest, and I can tell you, as of right now, I am definitely not prepared... but I'm damn excited to finally face the challenge.+ Fluid, seemless parkour+ Combat is fun+ Enemy AI is surprisingly smart+ Terrifying and exciting night cycle+ Scavanging every nook and cranny for lootCharacters:Some characters are well-performed while others just aren't. Gazi's performance, in my opinion, is laughably bad, but I began to think that it may have been intentional? And Rahim... he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the day, all he needs to do is dye his hair yellow. Brecken, Jade and Lena are among my favorite so far, with Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DA:Inquisition with her hair and accent. Overall, characters are decent, and that's all that really needs to be said, so far at least.+ Some interesting characters- Some poor performancesTechnical:Graphics are gorgeous, and surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080. Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance option, I can barely see much of a difference in-game with that option set to half or max. The only issue I've noticed is that very very rarely, when you're fighting biters with melee weapons, the game randomly hitches, then continues normally. It only happens in combat, but not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system. Overall, everything looks great, and the graphics and effects are wonderful. For an ugly game, the visuals are surprisingly beautiful.Sound:Music is great, but my only comment is that the music that plays when you're outside has one part where a random singer begins to chant, and I swear it scares the crap out of me every time. Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfying, and you can tell when you've hit the right spot, while hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump. I've yet to get a gun though (I've spent a lot of time just wandering around so I'm not too far into the campaign) so I can't comment on that. Also, make a little bit more noise and you'll hear bone-chilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you. Very satisfying sound work overall.Story:I haven't gotten far into the story so I'll hold off until I've completed it to fill this section.I basically wanted to come out and say how much I'm enjoying this game and to tell people to ignore the false statements about this game and give it a try. If you liked Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you hated Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you're a fan of first person, open-world games, then I'd bet you'll like this game.;Recommended;86.8;28/01/2015;1,883;139
Techland;Dying Light;Action, RPG;R$ 50,99;Lemme give it to y'all straight, who are on the fence.- Yes, the game is very much worth it at full price.- One of the first games in a long while, that has kept me up until 5 A.M. in the morning, because of how lost I get myself into it.- Doesn't do dumb jump scares, save for a VERY FEW TIMES, and each one counted.- The game is maybe one of the best zombie based games out there, so long as you do enjoy it with action.- Parkour in the game is AMAZING. Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can runaround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,you'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact. co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!TL.DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.;Recommended;48.7;9/02/2015;1,057;72
Techland;Dying Light;Action, RPG;R$ 50,99;I've never been one for zombie games but this game changed my mind!  Below is a review of the single-player campaign (I don't play multiplayer so can't comment on these elements).  Hope it helps you. :)What is it?Dying Light is a superb open-world game (a mix of survival, first-person action and RPG) where the citizens of Harran (a fictional place in Turkey) are becoming infected with a rabies-related virus.  Your task (as protagonist Kyle Crane) is to locate research regarding a cure on behalf of the Global Relief Effort.  You join a garrisoned band of survivors in Harran and take on the role of one of their 'runners' (people who carry out the dangerous work of gathering supplies and carrying out other requests on behalf of survivors) as a guise while you try to infiltrate and locate a wanted man and some vital data.The game's large, open-world environments are incredible - set in the slums of Harran and (later) Old Town - both locations offering a different style of parkour.  Your movement will be a mix of running, jumping, using a grapple hook or sliding down cables.  Oh, and the odd swim!  The parkour is fluid, easy and not over-fantasised (it is not beyond imagining that a fit and strong man could perform the moves the game offers).  The campaign itself is of good length and enjoyable, and there is a wealth of optional side missions and challenges to complete.The game is divided into two scenarios: day and night.  By day, the infected and 'virals' roam the streets aimlessly (often in huge numbers) but don't present too much of a danger provided you keep to rooftops and higher areas.  At night though, everything becomes much more sinister!  Not only are the infected out in greater number, but a darker, almost indestructable breed of the infected comes out for the hunt.  They're stronger than you, faster than you, and would like dinner with you (you as the main course).  There is no other recourse but to stay indoors and sleep until daybreak, or dare to go out and use stealth and speed as best you can.  It's worth it because you'll get double experience points, but you might not last too long.  You have been warned!Weapons and upgradesThe game uses three large sets of upgrade paths for Crane: survivor, agility and power. You'll earn upgrades by gathering experience points in each of these three areas.  The weapon system is wonderful.  At first, you have nothing but bits of wood, table legs, the odd wrench here and there - with which to pummel the infected until they die.  But as your survivor experience points ramp up, so does the quality and power of  the available weapons and it won't be long before you're one-shot-killing the bulk of infected people.  Weapons can be upgraded with enhancements and buffs as you collect them, but they don't last forever.  You can repair a worn-out weapon only so many times before you must find or buy another in Harran.DifficultyFor more skilled players, a HARD mode has been added.  Good luck with that!  For the rest of us, I would say the difficulty is at medium level when playing on 'normal'.  You'll be in for some fights and reliance on parkour from the start, but nothing feels unachievable.  There will be enemies that at first will be too tough to confront head-on, but nothing is beyond reach.    At first, I tended to cling to roof tops and would become easily overwhelmed by the infected if I found myself in the middle of a street, but I didn't have to wait until too long before I was easily able to defend myself and reap all the resources infected bodies still carry once killed.  The only element of the game I didn't enjoy difficulty-wise was the small number of speed challenges (same sort of thing as the speed challenges in Assassin's Creed) but these are totally optional and nothing is lost for any player who prefers not to complete them.  The parkour is really nicely done - it's easy to imagine that it's real-world achievable for a fit and strong person without being beyond realism (no silly platformer manoeuvres here).  As for choice of controller, I actually found mouse and keyboard much easier for the parkour than my XBox 360 gamepad.  Both are supported and hot-switchable but I found Kb/M more accurate.  Overall, gameplay felt fluid and fun, with very few frustrating moments throughout the game.Game quality and lengthI have not yet seen a game world that is more detailed than this.  It's clear the designers absolutely loved what they were doing (the level of detail in even the least consequential things is astonishing).  The dust and particle effects are stunning.  The voice-acting of Crane is absolutely first-class and really gives personality to the protagonist.  I didn't feel many of the NPC characters were quite so strong, but they weren't bad either.  It took me over 100 hours to complete the game, but on average I take twice as long as the average gamer, so expect at least 50 hours of gameplay.  The story was enjoyable without being too predictable (a few twists and turns along the way) and it has left me wanting to replay the game.Performance-wise, I only had problems with one area towards the end where framerates dropped and grass polygons were no longer rendering correctly.  Out of 100 hours, that was about 10 minutes of gameplay, but I'm running the game with a 6Gb nvidia Titan Black on a new 6-core i7, so there is a good chance there will be the same or similar problems on anything less than that (caveat: I did ramp up every single setting in the game) so you might need to dial back some things, but frankly, no matter what level of settings you use, you will still be impressed by the graphics.Anything not to like?While the side missions were varied and fun, I didn't much like the speed challenges as they really didn't fit well with the story and were a tad too difficult for bad gamers like me!  Sometimes, 'trap' zombies were placed purposely behind closed doors with no chance for the player to take avoiding action, resulting in immediate death. death isn't a huge problem (you'll just lose a chunk of experience points) but it felt a bit unnecessary to put these deliberate traps in the game.  Finally, there is a big announcement on-screen about being about to embark on the final part of the game (it's really just to tell you that while the game will end you will still be able to finish off other missions and such).  This totally broke the immersion for me (I would rather the game just flowed into that final sequence) but it's a petty thing really, demonstrating that there really isn't much to dislike about the game at all.ConclusionDying Light is an incredible game.  Single-players are getting a LOT of game for the money here, and even at full price it feels like a bargain. Even if you're not struck by zombie games, if you like a GOOD open-world game, I really recommend it.  A huge thank-you to the developers for giving me a fantastic 100+ hours of quality entertainment!;Recommended;336.0;23/05/2015;374;17

Techland;Dying Light;Action, RPG;R$ 50,99;This is a great game. How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking "plenty of time" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to do, like this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* "sure I can do that, plenty of time still". Then only 5 minutes before night, I complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse. On the way I find a police van practically unguarded! Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies. After all it could be rifle ammo, or a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done looting, but oh ♥♥♥♥! it's almost 20:00, my watch is beeping, night is coming now! A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still it's too late, monsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back. Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am. Then glorious "pursuit evaded" message appears. Phew. I now pay attention to the search cones on the minimap and successfully sneaks back to the tower.;Recommended;183.1;23/07/2015;1,46;438

Techland;Dying Light;Action, RPG;R$ 50,99;KEEP IN MIND THIS REVIEW IS GOING OVER DYING LIGHT, NOT DYING LIGHT THE FOLLOWING AT THIS POINT. I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I GET INTO THE FOLLOWING. ALSO, I HAVE YET TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WITHIN DYING LIGHT. Ok now onto the review for what I think so far :)"Oh man this is just another ♥♥♥♥ zombie game." WRONG. It sure is a zombie game, but the added features of parkour and freerunning, combined with the large open world, and a fresh feel the often over-saturated zombie genre.PROS:- Gameplay is amazing. Parkour and freerunning are both very smooth, and there are very few issues with the movement. The one only area that doesn't do great in this regard is getting up cliffs or rocky areas, but considering that Dying Light takes place in an urban environment, you aren't gonna be climbing up that many cliffs tbh.- Weapon Upgrading feels really rewarding, where you find what you need to upgrade a weapon in the world, and then can add a variety of upgrades to (melee) weapons such as fire, electricity, bleeding, and toxicity. It feels pretty damn cool to get a high end weapon and add flame to it, so when you hit a zombie it will burst into flames. Guns in this game are relatively easy to come across once you get to a high enough survivor level, however it's rare enough that it's still special.- The upgrade trees give really awesome upgrades to your character and general survivability without feeling too overpowered for a good amount of the game. Obviously when you max out all your levels, then you are kind of an unstoppable beast, but at least it's not a situation where you get a level and go from really weak to tremendously overpowered. For Agility, you gain points by (as you may have guessed) running around the map, jumping and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. For Power, you can gain these points from killing zombies and generally doing damage. The best part is that you can get points towards this through molotovs, or other zombie-killing devices other than your own weapons. This is a plus because sometimes you are focusing so much on quests and running around to the point that your agility level is off the charts, while your power level is like, level 5. The Survival level is upgraded by completing quests, capturing airdrops, and saving survivors. One thing to keep in mind, is if you plan to play with friends, I would HIGHLY reccomend having one save file for yourself and another for you to play ewith your friends. I ran into a situation where I was playing by myself and then bringing my friend into that game when he was available. This meant that he only got survivor rank credit from the quests that we did together, and so I was a way higher rank than him. Then there's the legendary rank, which is unlocked after unlocking all the upgrades in every other skill tree. It turns you into a zombie killing tank, by increasing max health, stamina, as well as specific weapon damage. Overall, the upgrades are challenging enough and also provide you with enough reason to try to level up a certain skill.- The world of Dying Light is really damn cool. It seems authentic and realistic, and does not seem forced at all. It makes it really interesting for parkour, as well as when you are running away from a viral or a volatile.- The Volatiles in this game are actually terrifying, and also new and original which is great to see in the zombie genre. They are super-human zombies (rather ironic choice of words but you ge the idea) and they only come out at night. This makes any situation where you are stuck outside after the sun's gone down really damn intense. Dying Light does a great job making you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrified of the dark. The other zombies and special infected are pretty generic, but still, what those are lacking for, I feel like the volatiles make up for that one hundred percent. There are new infected added into Dying Light The Following from what I have seen, but in the base game, the infected that you encounter in the daytime are pretty damn generic.- The Hud is really clean and easy to understand, no problems whatsoever.- The graphics in this game are beautiful, with lens flare and all other sorts of cinematic effects, you feel like you are playing a movie sometimes. Absolutely gorgeous game!CONS:- As mentioned before, the average infected you will meet will be more of the same. The volatiles I personally believe help change the entirety of the game, but still overall the zombies are pretty underwhelming and quickly become an inconvienence rather than something scary within the game.- The story leaves lots to be desired. There is a lot of stereotypes and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of cliches, and is very predictable. - The characters are pretty bland. Many you meet you will frankly not care about. The game lacks in character backstory, which makes you quite apathetic towards a lot of people. That being said, there is one guy (whos name escapes me) that just hangs out beside the elevator in the tower when you ride it up and is like, the nicest dude from the get go. I love that man. In conclusion, if you are looking for a beautiful game with great mechanics player upgrades that you can sink hours into without realizing, Dying Light is the game for you. However, if you are looking for a very story-rich game, then this will fall short. I personally have had a blast with this game, and playing with friends makes the game just that much better. I would highly reccomend. Thanks for reading my review! It is the first review I have done, but who knows, I may do more. Hope you have a fantastic day :);Recommended;74.5;20/09/2017;296;10

Techland;Call of Juarez: Gunslinger;Action;R$ 49,99;Probably best Far West-shooter everCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is the fourth installment in a series of shooters dedicated to the Far West, developed by the excellent Polish team Techland and distributed by Ubisoft. Well, some may argue it's only the third real Call of Juarez game, since the previous one, Call of Juarez: The Cartel, did have a rather different and more modern-day background. As The Cartel did not get a particularly positive reaction, many thought the series had went off-track. But they were far from the truth: with Gunslinger, Techland has for me made not only the best game in the series, but probable the best Far West-shooter ever. A bold statement, so let me explain in detail.The concept of the game is original and well thought-off. You play as the bounty-hunter Silas Greaves, who tells his story in a Far West-saloon to a bunch of regular customers. As his story unfolds, it soon becomes clear Silas has a penchant to exagerrate some parts of it, which is why his  story is more and more questioned by his audience. This idea of "truth or false" is cleverly catched upon by the collectible items that are to be found throughout the game. These "nuggets of truth" give a fairly detailed amount of information on the history of the Far West, its main protagonists and some lesser-known historical facts.  The entire game provides prove of the love of Techland's crew for this setting: every bit of it, from the very easy to manage menu's right up to the credits, bathes in a unique Old West-style. There are countless references to the history of 19th-century America, and to the influence this period had on later arts such as literature and, ofcourse, movies.As for the actual gameplay: it leans more towards an arcade shooter than towards a tactical or realistic game. There is a fair arsenal of weapony, each with some characteristics of their own, but most enemies go down easily and swiftly. What makes the shooting really fun, is the idea of the "combo": whenever you manage to shoot several enemies in a row, a multiplier comes into play, so that your experience-points go up that much faster. Getting one more kill in a row so becomes a goal of its own. Since experience-points are connected to a clever system of levelling-up and gaining interesting skills, getting longer kill-streaks soons becomes a true challenge. Added to these are two special effects: bullet-time, triggered by special shots like headshots or piercing shots, and the "sense of death", which allows you to dodge bullets at the last moment. Boss fights come in two types: normal ones against more powerful foes, but also as typical Old West-duels, in which a totally different method of playing is needed. These feel a bit trial-and-error at first, but after some practice, still can provide their share of the fun. And they provide great links to several Westerns, starring the great Hollywood-heroes of decades ago.Graphically, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is very good-looking. The game uses a comics-style with cel-shaded graphics, loosely comparable to the Borderlands-series. Enemy-animations are fairly standard, and enemies don't come in that much varieties. However, these are minor criticisms, since the game comes at a very acceptable price, although it has the scope and content of a true AAA-title. After finishing the main story (which took me about 8 hours), there's a New Game Plus-mode, very useful to collect the XP needed in order to unlock all of the skills, and a True West-difficulty, in which most of the HUD is disabled.Very entertaining is the Arcade-mode, in which ten of the games' maps can be replayed with as sole objectivity to get as much points as possible by making very long kill-streaks. Since the Steam-integration also comprises global leaderbords, tihs is great fun as I tried to get up the rankings a bit.Gameplay: 26/30Graphics: 17/20Sound: 8/10Technical stability: 9/10Longelivety: 8/10 (thanks to the several difficulty-levels and the Arcade mode)Steam Integration: 10/10 (really perfectly done, with a great bunch of achievements that let you discover several special aspects of the game - and do try to collect all of the "nuggets of truth"!)Personal appreciation: 10/10 (I just LOVE this game)Overall score: 88/100Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is one the best games I've yet played this year.

But rewarding.STATUS: COMPLETE.WHEN TO BUY:  A DECENT SALE.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a western themed FPS with a story-driven campaign and, arcade and dueling modes.  You take on the role of Silas Greaves a cowboy turned bounty hunter who must take on an assortment of robbers, thieves and legendery outlaws in order to track down and kill the gang responsible for murdering your brothers.  A deeply immersive story links together fourteen campaign levels, with high production value cutscenes, writing and voice-over dialogue.  Gameplay consists of running through linear but detailed levels, shooting enemies as they come into view inbetween hiding behind cover.  The higher your score the quicker your level rises, the faster skills can be chosen from three styles of gunslinger.  The more enemies killed, the more slow-mo time is generated, best used when outnumbered or outgunned.  Difficult duels that rely on focus and fast reflexes take place at the end of some levels, against one or two infamous outlaws.  Together with accuracy these same skills are needed for the arcade and dueling modes, with take out chunks of the campaign to replayed again but with a twist. THE GOOD:+ Amazingly written & voiced, authentic western story.+ Superb graphic novel-style cutscenes and shaded in-game graphics.+ Well-suited western/country style audio & soundtrack.+ Good amount of varied locations and enemies.+ Three skill trees: rifleman, pistolero and shotgunner. one for each style of play to specialize your gunplay.+ Great use of shooting-based QTEs/slow-mo mechanic to help you during the hardest firefights.  The more you kill the more you can slow time.+ Uplay 'not' required.+ Not an easy game to beat on harder difficulties.+ A few areas have gatling guns! :)THE BAD:- Duels can be a very frustrating experience.  Until you get to grips with the mechanics.- Arcade mode is essentially a rip-off of the levels from the campaign played like you would have an arcade game, a few decades ago.  Fun but a derivation of the campaign levels.- 100% completion will require several playthroughs (two to three) and multiple sessions for arcade and dueling mode.- Small and linear level design.- Not an easy game to beat on harder difficulties.AND THE ORDINARY:* All modes are singleplayer only.  Good for some.  Not so for others.  Depends where your preferences lie.* Nice use of flashbacks to retell story allows for some levels to be partly replayed in a different manner.* Campaign of fourteen missions are fairly similar in terms of gameplay, even if locations are graphically varied.* Heavy on spoken narration.  Can be skipped.  Mostly.* Multiple playthroughs needed (at least 2 for some achievements.)  Good if you enjoy the game.  Not so much if you were only planning one playthrough.* Basic enemy AI provides decent enemy behaviour which becomes predictable however.* Enemy spawns are almost identical every-time you restart a section.  VERDICT:Call of Juarez Gunslinger is worthy of being called a AAA title.  Having beaten the campaign on Hard and True West difficulties from my point of view the game's campaign is excellent.  A good size, with a good amount of variation and layouts.  Indeed everything about the game is stylish.  Top draw.  With high production values, amazing story, colourful visuals and outstanding voice and audio.  Together these elements provide as good a western experience as you will discover on PC.  One I found to be highly immersive.  I particularly loved the wonderful soundrack.  So if you're a secret redneck/hillbilly like me, youll probably also enjoy it.Gameplay is fast, fluid and well-paced and the clever use of storytelling, fairly varied level design [given their linearity] works well with the three distinct skill-trees and authetic era weapons.  While QTEs/slow-mo shooting mechanics are helpful to inexperienced players adding another dimension to gunplay, keep the experience interesting.  To the point that it should be an FPS that everyone plays.  At least once.  However its not all plain sailing.  Ive found it difficult to put a finger on why exactly so many gamers give up on this game. I did the first time I tried it.  I imagine that some players just  lose interest in playing. Maybe it is the linear nature of levels, the low technology level of weapons, the dated setting, or just the nature of gunplay.  Im not sure but there is something here that stops some gamers from getting the most out of this gem.  I guess some players may just feel that the true nature of gameplay is slow and plodding.  Maybe despite the initial easy learning curve, players find the difficulty ramps too fast.  If players don't get used to the game's slow-mo mechanics, learn when to make good use of cover, then they will die alot and frequently.  And then there are the Hard and True West difficulties which will really need an investment of time and practice.  The hardest levels require maxed out skills, good knowledge of the map and gameplay mechanics but above all else, fast and accurate reflexes.  Duels against known outlaws can also be a frustrating experience. Until the mechanics are understood.  Even with tutorials this is not a trivial thing and will take alot of repeated tries until the whole dynamic suddenly clicks.The Arcade and Duel modes are good enough to be tried at least a few times.  Yet looking at my friends list most give up after playing a few levels.  The arcade mode is essentially a rip-off of the levels from the campaign with the aim to get the the highest kill chain possible without missing one.  These also have a separate smaller skill-tree for each gun-slinging style, so if you don't like repeated play to level up again then you wont like this mode.  Duel mode comprises of fifteen stand-offs between the player and bosses from the campaign.  Where the ultimate goal is to beat every one without drawing first - easier said than done.  A word on achievements.  The game possesses more difficult than easy ones. Definitely one of the harder games to complete.  So if you're planning to complete the game I would suggest you know what you're in for.  Despite these negatives I would whole-heartly recommend the game to gamers who are after an FPS with a western ambience.  For what it is, its excellent.  Just be aware that you and this game just may not click, which would be a shame and a waste if you do happen to get it.  If you're still unsure then wait for a hefty sale and get it then.  However if you have the tenacity, patience and reflexes to get the most out of this game, I dare say you will not regret it one bit.;Recommended;31.9;3/06/2017;142;1

Techland;Dead Island Definitive Edition;Action;None;This is an EXCELLENT game. I played the original version of this game first and wasn't too happy with it. I think I was more disappointed in the fact that there was no difficulty setting adjustments which means the game is one set difficulty all the time. I had some trouble learning how to play it properly and lost focus. When the Definitive Edition came out and was only a few dollars I had to give it a second shot.On a second attempt I found that I absolutely LOVE this game. The Definitive Edition caught a lot of flack at first because of some bugs and missing features from the original version of the game but it was quickly patched and has no flaws in my opinion. I have played for HOURS on end and never recall one single crash or gamebreaking experience. The game looks beautiful and the various types of enemies make the game especially dynamic.I definitely recommend this title to anyone that likes the zombie apocalypse environment.;Recommended;58.9;3/06/2017;184;1

Techland;Dead Island Definitive Edition;Action;None;A BIG NO NO. Stick to the original, pray you can still buy it somwhere.This Definitive Edition is Definitive Bullsh*t!I played the original game over 300 hours. I cannot even count how many times I finished it. I know every aspect about the game that there is to know. And here comes the Definitive Edition. Ahhh men....They ♥♥♥*ed up many important aspects that made the first one such a classic.They made everything lighter (as in weight) in this game, so you can kick zombies around like rubber dolls, weapons fly like paper planes when you throw. If you play a character who focus on throwing weapons, well then... you're in for some amazing and exciting adventure called 'Where did my f***ing weapon dropped???!!!' after every zombie encounter, and this game is all about that.There are also many annoying bugs like loot chests dont restock (in the original they did so this IS A BUG)There are many items that dont respawn like they should (for example a car by the bunker on the south end of first map)There are zombies which I call "suprise zombies" that stand in one place facing the wall, when you approach them they suddenly and violently turn around and grab you. NOW in original it works perfectly 99% of times, and can give you a heart attack when you first encounter them... in DEFINITIVE EDITION they work perfectly 0% of times cause every time you approach them... THEY RUN STRAIGHT AHEAD.... YES... they run into a f**king wall (or whatever they are facing)and this is just the tip of the iceberg... if you want to know the whole extent of bugs and glitches then check out this threadhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/383150/discussions/0/364043054118534910/Least to say...

Techland;Hellraid;Action, RPG;None;Hola, amigos internautas. Les deseo una buena mañana/mediodía/tarde/noche o lo que sea que estén viviendo ahora mismo. Espero que se encuentren muy bien, yo lo estoy, y deseo lo mismo para todos.  Estamos aquí nuevamente con una reseña, y esta vez le toca al juego "Dying Light" de la empresa "Techland". Personalmente, este juego es de mi mayor disgusto, comparable incluso con "Borderlands 2" que me regaló mi amigo Firzah, el cual lamentablemente tuvo que jugar por sí mismo ese juego. Pero... Me estoy yendo por las ramas. La reseña es sobre Dying Light, es verdad.  Bueno, resumiendo mi reseña, esta pobre excusa de juego, el cual ¡¡¡NO!!! es una carta de amor al gaming, me iba a 5 fps cada vez que pegaba un ataque básico o saltaba, es decir, está muy horriblemente optimizado, ¡¡¡Ya que mi PC debería soportarlo!!! ¡¡¡Me enoja mucho!!!  Regresando a la crítica, el combate del juego no me parece demasiado destacable, ya que es muy repetitivo, no hay combos, no se puede bloquear desde minuto 0, y... lo peor de todo... ¡¡¡NO SE PUEDE HACER PARRY!!! Segundo, los personajes me parecen demasiado planos y sin desarrollo, como por ejemplo el personaje de "Rais". Ese "aliado" parece amigable, pero... es el mismísimo demonio... El protagonista, más de lo mismo, sin desarrollo, plano, mal modelo, etc. Nada destacable. Respecto a la banda sonora, la del juego "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance" de la empresa "Konami Digital Entertainment Co. Ltd" me pareció vencedora unánime de este combate mano a mano por la gloria. Ese OST (Official SoundTrack)... Ese OST... Me salvó la vida. Es... Simplemente hermoso. Devolvió la vida a mis ojos, incluso la gente a mi alrededor decía que parecía una persona completamente nueva, renovada, increíble, irreconocible... Pero... Este OST... El de Dying Light... Me hizo regresar a los viejos tiempos, en los que era un don nadie! Todos me odiaban! Mi vida ha empeorado desde que mi billetera soltó ese dólar para comprar Luz Moribunda! En conclusión, esta aplicación no es considerada un juego, ya que eso sería un insulto a los demás videojuegos dignos de ser llamados por su nombre, como por ejemplo... ¡¡¡La saga de PERSONA!!! No lo compren, ahorren, o gástenlo en cosas mejores. Como por ejemplo, la saga de ¡¡¡PERSONA!!! o, el anterior mencionado, carta de amor al gaming, cine absoluto, "Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance" de la empresa distribuidora INDIE y humilde por sobre todo, cabe mencionar, "Konami Digital Entertainment Co. Ltd". Con amor, Turron, y para los desarrolladores de "Dying Light", de la desarrolladora "Techland" con muchísimo ¡¡¡ODIO!!!Edit: Muchos saludos, abrazos y besos a mis queridísimos fans.

Techland;Pure Farming 2018;Simulation;R$ 59,99;If I could give this a neutral rating, I would. I don't understand how someone going into an existing market with farming sim games that have been around for YEARS can't possibly look at those games and say "Let me improve that..." (and as a result follow through on that statement). For the tl.dr version, scroll down to the bottom.With Pure Farming 2018, I suppose I was a bit undecided when they first started their marketing campaign. Much like the Farming Simulator series, they'll throw out that vid on YouTube and it's all sexy. They even went so far as to spotlight some of the things you could do. At first, I thought, well, it seems like they're on the right path. Then they deliver a game with a mix of bugs that, in some cases, they made worse with subsequent updates (e.g. helpers AI). Not only that, they do things like take away (or rather not implement) features that other sims have (after years of improvements) such as being able to shape your own fields, planting grass, creating piles of crops wherever, even chosing where to place new placeable buildings. And, they go and blantantly rip off an already flawed concept (collect 100 sapphires to net $200k? Wonder where that came from...).Some of the things that are a problem still as of this writing:- Helpers - They previously would miss strips of fields. Now, they still miss chunks of fields and worse, I'll find the one in my harvester wearing an outfit from the Japanese map stuck going back and forth at the edge of a field. When used to harvest potatoes, they stop working once the harvester is full. Every so often, you go to start a helper on a field and the command won't come up (you have to quit and reload the game to reset it so it works). Want to get the harvester going? Okay, turn it on, "Start Work" (??), and lower the header, NOW you can hire a helper. Hired a helper in a different location (say, Japan?), they stop working when you leave the map. And will likely bug out when you come back. gg.- Information cards - They show up when you're on a field or near a functional building. They'll often bug out and stop showing information, show information for the wrong building, or do weird things like tell me I have 10% of cows (i.e. the number of cows has a percent sign next to it). Worse is when they don't give you information despite the emphasis on how much information the game is giving you: orchards show water, spray, and water storage levels. no growing progress, bin fill levels or spoilage timers. - Field shaping - You can't merge fields together (to make them more viable) or otherwise modify fields. If they're so small they're largely useless, too bad. I'd understand if that were meant to keep game resources efficient but then you've got maps like the Japan one that's barely got 5 fields on it. - Equipment Selection - "100% licensed machines" because no one has ever licensed machines in a farming sim...but then there are only a handful. Need a spayer? There are two. The selection out of the box is slim. Something tells me they're hoping to bank on future DLC where they'll rake in the cash so we can offer ourselves more tractor options to match up with the FS series. But, hey, your tablet in game is now a DELL! - Teleportation/Reset - Got your trailer stuck on a rock? Good luck getting it down unless it's attached to a tractor. Have five of those trailers? Well, you can sell it but the selling interface? Lists every item with a price tag. No map, no way of knowing which one is which. Sure would be nice to reset it back to the shop or something. - Crops - One the one hand, there are crops you may not have seen in another game because of the "global" feature: rice, hemp, olives. That sort of got me going at first. But then you realize the Montana (US) map has the most selection. The others have 2-3 crops they can offer and that includes greenhouses and "hard-coded" crops like orchards and grape fields. I'm guessing they'll expand things later but something tells me they'll just go "Hey, here's a new location with 2-3 new crops!"- Market - No one's really got this right so far. Crops will sell for the same rough rate day after day. FS would throw in events where there'd be high demand or if you sold a bunch of crops, demand would drop. The prices here barely waiver. You're better off just setting all your greenhouses to Peppers since they're worth more per ton than the others. You can only grow grains on the Montana map (Rye, Wheat, Barley) with the exception of Potatoes. And they're all worth about the same per ton so outside of tweaking yields, you're going to make a set amount from that and it's all grind.- Potatoes - Had to bring this up since I mentioned it above. The only root crop available. Because of the helper problems above, they are super tedious to deal with. Small fields are finally worth something but the process of harvesting them is just ridiculous. The larger harvester (which is more a middle-tier one compared to what you could get in the vanilla FS 2017 game) fills up fast and bugs out even faster when you try to dump the crop into a trailer. It works, then it stops working unless you attach a tractor to the trailer in question. Bug, I guess, but the worst part: once the bin's full on the harvester, the helper stops helping. You have to go and restart them again. Just more tedious work to do. How you do this when you have half or more of the 30+ fields in the Montana map, I don't know.- Bales - Fun times. Bugs galore: teleport a bale trailer and it won't let you unload bales any more. Bale fork won't fork bales. Bale gripper won't grip bales unless you've got them skewed at an angle. Slips through otherwise. Bugs, sure, but how do you not notice these before launch?! Especially the bale gripper and fork?! It's a fundamental function of each!- Global Farming - This was the big marquee feature of the game that sold me (at first). FS did theirs up as an expansion and it was a whole lot of meh. So, here it is: Italy, Japan, Columbia (what no cocaine farming?!?), Germany even (if you put down for the pre-order...wait, no, now for the deluxe version. So much for exclusivity. Each map is introduced in the story mode in a particular order: Italy, then Columbia, then Japan. That also happesn to be the order (descending) of map sizes. Montana is the biggest, Italy is maybe half the size of Montana (you lose a chunk to a volcano no less). Columbia, more like a third of the Montana map. Japan, a quarter or less. Diminishing returns. They introduce interesting things, no doubt: olive tree harvesting, rice farming, etc. But once the gimmick wears off and you realize your helpers can't help you in Japan, let's say, while you head back to Montana to get things going, the shine disappears. Sure your crops will continue to ripen but unless you time things right, you'll be stuck with a mountain of work to do. And if you hire a helper, you have to stick around the map to keep them going. I don't get how they couldn't just simulate and extrapolate where a helper might be if they were assigned to a field and started harvesting. I understand needing to simplify the simulation when on another map but you're already doing so with the crop counters. I did my best to soldier through the campaign to give it a fair shake. They got a few things...well, I guess right but no more righter than other games. Does it look better? Only in that they buffed some textures so they look more antialiased. I wanted to like the game but it needs more work. More fixes, more equipment, better sim. You can get a better sim from vanilla Farming Sim 2017 right now for the same price or less. Better to wait and see if the devs will follow through and fix the important stuff but why pay full price for a game that should be in EA or Beta?;Not Recommended;69.6;29/04/2018;194;6

Techland;Pure Farming 2018;Simulation;R$ 59,99;Jack of all trades and master of nonePure farming 18 is a new farming game in the market which tries to compete with Farming simulator series and I think it does that successfully.Pure farming is almost a copy of Farming simulator, it has more features and more things to do, but still lacks in many areas.First lets talk about graphics. I thought it’s impossible to make a farming game which looks worse than Farming simulator but it seems it is possible. After I saw this will be published by Techland I thought the developers will get the funds and at least make the graphics good. The graphics are really bad. Low detailed environment, bad lighting and the worst thing – no AA support. Everything is shimmering and jaggies are everywhere, my eyes start hurting after some time. On top of all that performance is horrible. I have 7700k, 16GB of ram and GTX1070 and I can’t get 60fps on 1080p. This is ridiculous. Ah yeah the “best” engine ever – unity.Soil textures are taken straight from Farming simulator, it looks bad, just a texture, nothing more. Tractors leave no tracks on the ground (it’s just a texture, there’s no real tracks left in the soil). Crops don’t look realistic, feels very Farming simulatori’ish. You cannot destroy your crops by driving through the field and crops do not react and move in contact with tractor.Working the fields is fun at the start, but it gets boring after a while because it’s not realistic, feels more like a chore, no feeling of accomplishment. In Cattle&Crops it’s a real pleasure to work a field, even spending 2 hours on the same field feels good. But here you can just go and do something else instead thus making the boredom go away.You can hire a worker but it’s very limited, worker will only work the field, it can’t drive the trailer, empty the harvester by itself, drive to silo, empty the trailer, it just drives on the field back and forth, that’s it. Really bad. Again after playing Cattle&Crops my expectation got higher and i want better AI.Picking fruits or fertilizer isn’t fun, you just drive near to it, press a button and your vehicle is magically filled with boxes. I want to use the forklift and do it by myself. There’s a lot of driving back and forth which may get boring after a while.Tutorial is lacking and doesn’t explain much, you’ll need to figure most of the things by yourself. The game has many features and can be overwhelming at first.There are several maps and a lot of activities. You can breed animals, grow chickens, have greenhouses with vegetables, grow fruits and of course grow standard crops like corn or wheat. This is where this game shines – it has a lot of thing to do. If you get bored with one you can go do something else.Vehicle and equipment selection is great, you all kinds of brands and types of equipment and it will take some time to buy them all.Career mode is good, you get XP, increase your level and earn money to be able to afford new equipment and vehicles to ease your work.Controls are very similar to Farming simulator games. Physics is too, which is a bad thing. Tractors have no weight and car handling is absolutely terrible, feels like you're driving a paper car.You can’t use controller and keyboard at the same time. Controlling the vehicles is much more comfortable if you're using a controller and you’ll be doing this most of the time, but when you need to navigate the map and menu it is a real pain if you use controller and you’re forced to use it because mouse doesn’t work. Bad developers, bad!(insert slapping wrists with a ruler GIF).Overall this is not a bad game, but it tried to do so many things that none of them feel finished and polished enough. There’s hours of fun to have until you get bored doing all the different things, but eventually you will get bored because this game lacks depth. After playing Cattle&Crops I can’t play this for long. Although it could be fun if you’re looking for an arcade farming game, honestly I think this is the best arcade farming game on the market currently. If not for the terrible eye hurting graphics I would probably play this more. Get this on sale only.Pros:A lot of features and things to doCareer modeSeveral mapsCons:Absolutely terrible graphicsPoor performanceNot being able to use controller and mouse at the same timeMy curator page;Recommended;13.3;21/06/2018;84;6
Techland;Pure Farming 2018;Simulation;R$ 59,99;TL.DRIt's not 100% ready yet but shows promise. I'm still giving it a pass but if you expect something much different from FS17, like a more realistic sim, you probably will be disappointed.SummaryIt's better than Farming Simulator 17 without mods and in some respects more fun than FS17 with mods. It's got a lot of different crops, several countries to choose from, an easier to use UI and different animals. Overall, however, it is still a bit buggy, has very few brands to choose from and the maps are rather small. It seems like they've released it too soon. Things like the lack of real time, wheel support and occasional bugs and glitches could have been avoided. Because of that the reviews are tainted and are currently at 'mixed'. Probably nothing a few free DLCs couldn't fix but I hope it won't discourage the devs from polishing and further developing what seems like a good premise. What works1. A lot of crops that are more immersive than FS17 vanilla and modded ones. Rice for example is real fun with those funny machines and plowing under water. You don't get that in FS17 where most processes are rather similar to each other. 2. Several different countries to choose from, each with different aesthetics. Japan is my favorite so far, it seems really fresh.3. Graphics is sometimes better and sometimes similar, and very stable with 60 FPS compared to occasional stuttering on FS17, especially modded one. 4. The campaign mode is a nice addition.5. The dev support. They roam the forums trying to see what we're complaining about and responding to many threads. That's really nice.6. I like that the car you drive is licensed. I really didn't like that bland "Lizard" one. What doesn't work1. The lack of wheel support. A very big mistake if you're making a sim game and the reviews reflect that. 2. Lack of real time which causes crops to grow in the middle of sowing at times. [It is seemingly addressed and will be fixed soon.]3. Worker AI is really bad. 4. Very few brands to choose from. I know it's hard to get licenses with such a juggernaut like FS17 but in order to combat this you need a lot of decent mods. We'll see if those will be made soon. Also, there are no American trucks which is too bad when you're playing in Montana.5. Vehicle interiors are not very good. 6. It's too similar to FS17. It's perhaps even more arcade at times. Too bad they didn't make it a more realistic simulation, or one where you can really adjust certain things like physics without using mods. Overall, if it doesn't get mods that let you adjust realism soon, it might be too bland.;Recommended;8.0;14/03/2018;47;1
Techland;Pure Farming 2018;Simulation;R$ 59,99;TLDR: Nicely built competitor to Farming Simulator with more emphasis on actual farming, with a much wider variety of crops/animals. Good buy for farm sim fans who like a lot of diversity in their game.I'm a big Farming Simulator fan (check my play time) but always wanted more variety in what I could do in-game out of the box, without risking my game files with major game-altering mods.Pure Farming really scratches that itch for me with a lot more crop selection from four different countries, more animal choices, and even more realism such as droughts and pest invasions. Yet all done in an easy to navigate control that fits very comfortably with my Farming Simulator game experience.Can finally grow more unique crops like coffee, rice, grapes, olives, fruit orchards, rabbits, pigs, and such. More than enough to keep my game varied and interesting.Fields are nice and squared off, with a decent-sized buffer zone around them to maneuver machinery around.And finally I got all of my storage bins back,  whereas Farming Simulator is seeming to get lazier and lazier about it. No more just dumping crops on the ground with no idea of how much you have. Everything has a storage bin with easily trackable volume. That alone gave me a huge sigh of relief since I'm a bit OCD about my inventory control.Does the game have its problems. Sure.I'm not too keen on the extremely short life spans of livestock. Heck, rabbits only live for 6 days, and chickens only produce for around 11 days, and nothing really lives/produces for more than 30 in-game days, so ranching is pretty much a joke IMO.You can't turn off crop withering, which might become a real drag on having farms across four continents to keep track of, and worker AI, from what I've heard since I never use it, is hit and miss much like FS's early days.And I'm sure there'll be more as I play, but also probably some more good points.All I'm saying is, I'm quite enjoying the game. It's a welcome diversion from Farming Simulator and they do a lot of things right that Farming Simulator is getting lazier about with being the only big kid on the block. So more power to them. Fix the bugs/glitches/quality of life improvements, KEEP MY DERN STORAGE BINS, and I'm a happy camper.;Recommended;10.9;8/07/2018;32;3
Techland;Pure Farming 2018;Simulation;R$ 59,99;Montana, Rabits are floating around outside of the cages, even after all of them are sold. Shortly after, game screen went black and crashed! This game is promising but still needs quite a bit of work. The available equipment is quite a short list with there being only 3 of many of the different types. Maybe the Steam Workshop content being added will help solve some of the issues and add more equipment. The truck cannot tow any trailers, no sense in buying/keeping one. The AI is almost useless, they will occasionally reach the end of a row and proceed to back up and move forward until manual control is taken over. I have yet to have AI complete an entire task without any assistance. In its current state I would say that it is not quite up to par for the cost. Wish I had listened to many of the negative reviews and waited on this one. I would not recommend this at this time. Maybe later down the road.;Not Recommended;12.3;26/06/2018;27;2
Techland;Pure Farming 2018;Simulation;R$ 59,99;Still early days but some things i like compared to other games of its type.1. It’s a bit simpler which personally i find more relaxing and enjoyable2. The story mode is welcome to the genre3. So many complaints about lack of mods but i guess I'm just old school and prefer games vanilla4. Other games rely on mods for crops, trees, greenhouses etc. This game has all that and more in vanilla5. A global empire sounds interesting but I'm yet to experience this yet6. Some complaints have been made about certain map sizes, get your head out of FS ways and start thinking globally. You play all maps/regions in the same save. FS maps sure are bigger but each one is a new game.7. Sure there is a few bugs, a few obvious mistakes by the devs like lack of key binding options at release but all this will be patched over the coming weeks. 8. I’m kind of glad the focus on a true single player game mode is welcome and MP is coming later anyway.On a side note FS going on 50% sale same day PF releases is just shady pointless tactics and is why i wish PF the best of luck. FS has played it safe over the years and good competition in the genre is good for players.;Recommended;46.3;13/03/2018;21;1

This only bugs I've ever encountered was with helpers near release of the game. Yes the game could use more equipment but their working on it always releasing updates.

Techland;Pure Farming 2018;Simulation;R$ 59,99;I bought and am playing Pure Farming 2018, because am fed up with the other one from Giants.Farming is still farming. Can't really revolutionize that, but you can try to do it differently than Giants. And Pure Farming 2018 is doing just that. My biggest joy is the fact that weather now actually has a role to play, of course it does. It's farming! The rain irrigates the fields, of course it does. You can also irrigate it yourself, when it hasn't rained in many days, of course you can. Or your crops rots away, because it has rained many days in a row, of course it can happen. It never did in Giants, but it does in Pure Farming.The sky is actually moving in Pure Farming, it was an annoyingly static paint job in Giants  It has bugs, mainly bugs that, until they are fixed, can be rectified with save and reload. The devs are eager to correct, so I'm positive that they will be ironed out eventually.I'm happily farming away in Pure Farming 2018. Giants needed competition, and now they got it.;Recommended;107.3;29/03/2018;15;N/I
THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;Even though I put in the work to beat the game, I honestly can't recommend it.The game-play is fun! Combo moves are what make it shine. However, levelling up seems pointless since the entire world scales with you and the stats you earn don't exactly help you at all. The stat bars show you a potential gain, but the bars revert back after. Feels cheap.Customizing weapons seems fun at first! But you quickly learn that you are overloaded with so much loot so fast that you need to take breaks to scrap your trash every 15 minutes.The storyline and world are.... awful. You can tell that the devs started with a great idea, but then got bored of the game about 2 hours into it. They present you with these backstories and main missions (save the tree, destroy worldeaters, unite the tribes), but as soo as you start to delve into it, you can tell that every tribe-to-seize is coded the exact same way. As well as the worldeater campaigns. Right down to what things each NPC says. Sure they might vary up how they say it, but they say the exact same things and give you the exact same missions.I dunno... I just felt like I was playing the same mission over and over just because some cheeky coders thought they could get away with copy-pasting their code a million times. And overloading you with so many pointless sidequests that you are just following blue dots on the map doesn't help.No closure at the end even. Just like a "Cool, you did the thing! Great work." and the game ends. It's downright maddening.;Not Recommended;91.7;22/05/2022;514;9

THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICETHIS GAME IS EXTREMELY OVERPRICEDWith that out of the way...It's a real shame THQ abandoned this game during development, and the devs abandoned it on release day, not wasting a single second & not even closing the door on the way out. The devs are NOT interested in this title, and have totally abandoned it - there are bugs & other issues that will never be fixed, because Experiment 101 is staffed by selfish jerks who are happy for you to pay them but not happy to make sure what they're selling you is finished.So, we're looking at this game as the abandoned child it is. It's not going to be awesome, complete or lead to more - the devs have decided they do not care.I was shocked at how nice the game looks & how deep the mechanics are. I was expecting the absolute bare-minimum in every area, but there is more meat to the game than it first appears.That's not to say this is like Star Citizen or ArmA - it's just nicely featured as far as combat & config go.The world is pretty, prettier than you'd expect largely due to the art style. There is a charm that this game has all to itself. It's smaller than you'd expect, though.Where the game really falls down is in the polish & mid-late game content areas. Obviously this is due to the devs all moonwalking straight outta there as soon as possible at any opportunity. It's a shame, this could have been proper 8-9/10 material with more work & some love, which it clearly never got at any stage during development.This is a 6.5/10 action "RPG". It's available elsewhere for $10-15, and that's what it's worth.Do not pay more than that.P.S. the DLC is worthless and can be unlocked in game, don't bother;Recommended;2.9;17/04/2022;988;14
THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;100% achievement review:I'm putting Recommend, but with the caveat that you match the "for you" lines below more than the "NOT for you" lines below. Only you can say if you do.If you like high levels of customization in both gear and character, this game is for you.If you like well written dialogue, this game is NOT for you.If you like exploring a vast open world and finding weird things, like a random lone monster with half a dozen eyes, or a magic briefcase, this game is for you.If you like deep morality systems where your choices affect more during the playthrough than cosmetic stuff, this game is NOT for you.If you like quirky unique art styles, this game is for you.If you like challenging puzzles, this game is NOT for you.If you like a high level of options in combat, this game is for you.If you like to be challenged tactically and required to use a variety of said combat options, this game is NOT for you.If you like companies that respond to criticism by making changes the community wants, this game is for you. (one week in and they've already started)If you like your wallet, this game is NOT for you. (The $60 launch price was too high for this game)Conclusion: I have fun with it, but that's because of how I play. I use the super wushu triggering combos, dodging, and the more bizarre powers, as opposed to those who button-mash and kite. I turn the narrator's frequency to its lowest setting (highly recommend).  I play on highest difficulty. I spend my time mostly exploring and cobbling together weird gear, and only doing the main plot when I happen to be in the area for an objective. I really think this IP has potential. I'd recommend they replace the narrator with actual voice to make the characters more memorable, and differentiate the factions by more than dress style and light/dark, and put some secret super-bosses out there that require to you be very tactical in combat. Because I see the potential, I want this to be successful enough to warrant future projects. That, plus the fact that I simply enjoy running around in this colorful, unique world, influenced my decision to recommend.;Recommended;60.3;2/06/2021;678;14
THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;Biomutant is a bit of a disappointment.  Not because I expected it to be anything but okay or mediocre when I purchased it (I’m accustomed to other THQ games), but because it managed to successfully convince me within the first few hours that it *wasn’t* just okay or mediocre, only to let me down completely by mid game.  At the beginning you are exposed to this massive world much like any open world game, and there is a sense that you have this unlimited excitement and opportunity for exploration and character advancement. The world/setting in this game is absolutely spectacular.  Seriously.  The team that worked on building all the environments deserve credit for how incredible everything looks.  It’s so strikingly better than every other aspect of the game that the contrast between other aspects of the game detracts from the overall experience.  It’s also huge- *too* huge, and ends up already feeling empty before you make it out of the first zone.Previews of the game suggested that biomes would be these unique areas that (did I mention how awesome they look?) you would have to prepare for by acquiring gear to shore up resistances etc.  However, it is so laughably easy to find items with these resistances that the excitement of exploring these areas is completely negated. For all of maybe 2 hours I wondered what secrets would be contained in these seemingly unassailable biomes and then I came to the slow realization that it was more fluff and padded content disguised as a different color.Character advancement is so shallow that I absolutely stopped caring about improving my character before I even hit midgame.  It felt as if I had unlocked every meaningful perk after a few hours and the rest was pointless. I realize that this isn’t Path of Exile but even if they had added incremental stat bonuses (the most boring of all feats in most games) it would have been adequate, despite the fact that the character attributes themselves are boring.  For example, Agility affects movement speed and…Well, that’s it.  Charisma affects barter prices but you are bombarded by so much loot to sell in this game that you’d have to be spending like Richard Pryor in Brewster’s Millions to have a chance of going broke.  If the developers had balanced the game around adding more % bonuses to character attributes (and had them affect more aspects of character strength) it would have at least made the game more engaging. Enemy variety is not varied at all and attack patterns seem almost universal to each type regardless of their appearance. And speaking of appearance, some of the character models are so bad that I honestly thought some there were a few placeholder designs that somehow got overlooked before release.  I don’t have a whole lot to say about the main story.  It is acceptably boring but also very padded for content. There is the usual laundry list of pointless side quests of that you’d expect in an open world game but it seemed much more noticeable in Biomutant.  Because there is no voice-acting (all the creatures speak in gibberish) I had even less of a desire to be engaged or immersed in any events.  I realize that quality VA is expensive and I respect the developers for cutting corners where they did, but it’s just one more element that detracts from the experience.26 hours in (as of writing) and already I lack the will to continue.  I wrote the majority of this review the yesterday thinking that I’d give it a few more hours to see if I changed my mind, and if anything my opinion worsened.  I tried hard to like this game.  I really did.  I feel like the developers could have taken the time to make many aspects of the game that I described at least *passably adequate* and the charm and world-building would have been enough to carry the game far beyond mediocrity and into the realm of "very good".  I think that is what sours me the most on the experience of playing Biomutant- that there was so much wasted potential and I can’t help but wonder what could have been.;Not Recommended;26.2;16/06/2021;799;21
THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;The game is very enjoyable on it's first few hours. After that, everything gets very repetitive and tedious. Combat is very shallow. Exploration and world building is mediocre. The world looks gorgeous, but is very dull in terms of things that you can do.

THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;It's games like this that make me wish Steam had more than a "Yes" or "No" for reviews. This game was by no means bad, but it has mixed reviews for good reasons. I don't typically structure my reviews with Pros and Cons, but I'm going to do that for this one to try to streamline my thoughts.Pros:The world, graphics, and artstyle are beautiful, easily one of the best looking games I've played in 2021 so far. You can clearly see that the devs put a lot of passion into this project just by looking over the world and the character/enemy designs. Exploring this world, despite a decent amount of it reusing the same area layouts, was a lot of fun, and the main reason I spent more than 100 hours in this game.The combat in this game is solid. It's your basic hack and slash type combat system, mixed with some powerful ranged combat. It's simple, to the point, but effective.The crafting system is one of the primary reasons I got invested in this game pre-launch, it hold ups just as well as I expected it to, and is easily the best feature this game has to offer. Customization is pretty good. You can customize your rat thing to be anywhere from a "normal" looking rat to an absolute monster. Cons:The story wasn't that great. It was split into the 4-ish parts, the player character's story, the tribe war, the world eaters, and the overall lore of the game. The lore wasn't too bad, but rather than letting the player piece things together they'll spell it out for you, which kind of hindered that experience. The tribe war is a logical concept for a post apocalyptic setting, but due to the way the characters are handled, fell flat on almost all fronts.The World Eater story ties into the tribe war story, and it's pretty straight forward. There's a big tree, it's dying, you can choose to let it die or save it. It plays like Breath of the Wild's story on a fundamental level, you find a local, get their help prepping for the big fight, then go do the big fight. It's serviceable.Then there's the player story, which just really wasn't good at all. It came off like a poorly written children's book about how revenge is bad. It's consistent, at least, but I wouldn't call it good.The narrator basically ruins the dialogue for the game. Disregarding the fact that he tosses out random quips here and there during combat, because that can be turned off, all the dialogue in the game is done through the narrator's perspective. It's not like the narrator has a bad voice or anything, the dialogue just comes off as empty because of this decision. A narrator doing this can work, but it fell extremely flat here.The characters in this game have next to 0 personality, and that all ropes back into the narrator talking for each character you encounter. Each character speaks a bit of gibberish, and the narrator translates it. I say translate, but he more or less just does a dry read of their emotional state and what they want you to do. The characters in this game feel lifeless due to this, and the random NPCs all repeat the same 15 or so lines of dialogue to you when you encounter them because of this decision. While I said the combat was simple and effective, the way you upgrade your combat skills is pretty lackluster. All the pieces exist for it to be good, but they're not fleshed out enough. That, and there's an overabundance of upgrade resources. By the time I got to a stopping point with this game I had over 80 of one resource, and 20 or so of another upgrade resource. On one hand, it's great that they're not starving their players for skill points, but on the other hand drowning the player in them without a way to spend those points is arguably worse.Enemy variety could've been better.Overall, if you're playing this game for a good story, might as well go play something else, you're not gonna find it here. If you're looking for a relatively interesting world to explore, then this game may fill that void for a little bit, but not at the full 60 dollar price tag. Maybe if it goes on a 50% sale. I enjoyed my time with this game for the most part, but not everyone will, and the mixed reception is justified for this title. It doesn't seem like the game fell flat in a lot of areas due to a lack of care by the developers, because there's clearly a lot of passion that went into this product, however it's their first game, and that lack of experience shows here.I had been following this game for a little while because of the concepts brought to the table, and all the pieces are in all the right places here, but it's like some of the pieces are soggy and don't fit in right with the rest of the puzzle to give you a truly satisfying end product. It's a shame really, there's a lot of potential here, but Experiment 101 seem to be done with this game. I guess not everything can be a No Man's Sky, right?;Not Recommended;109.4;22/10/2021;228;1
THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;Biomutant, to me, is bittersweet.I wish I could with all my heart recommend this game - but ultimately after so many hours, after NG+ failing to start and bricking my save, I simply can't.Biomutant is a wonderful labor of love, burdened by feature creep, poorly thought out mechanics and a lack of polish. Its world is gorgeous and interesting, the crafting system and character designs fantastic, the combat mostly fluid and exciting (even with the occasional jank), and the open world gameplay engaging - but in the end, it's all weighed down by its numerous, blatant flaws in core gameplay elements, blatantly unfinished features and countless upon countless problems with bugs. And none of this even delves into the story, which means to portray the world in a "shades of grey"-sort of morality, but just ends up with a black-and-white worldview where you are questioned throughout regardless. nor have I yet made mention of the countless characters, none of which I even recall the names of due to their roles in the story being so sheerly forgettable.So, why did I keep going?The /charm/ is there. The /love/ the dev team poured in is in every fiber of the game's being, its visual design, the combat, the items and armor and the customizability of them. There are so many things I simply /want/ to love, but can't. Despite all these grievances, I kept going because the game scratched a very particular itch for me: I'm a pack rat through and through, and deeply in love with modular customization of weapons and equipment no matter the game. I'd felt that itch a while now, and Biomutant came at a very opportune time.That said... I just cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone who doesn't share that particular itch as I do.I solemnly hope that the dev team gets another crack at this franchise. There could be great, /great/ things here if they're given another chance, with the experience they are now armed with.So wonderfully, stingingly bittersweet.;Not Recommended;70.9;9/07/2021;315;6
THQ Nordic;Biomutant;Action, RPG;R$ 75,00;One of the biggest disappointments I can remember in a very long time. There was so much hype around this game pre-launch and it got delayed so many times that I somehow held out hope that the delays were just more fine tuning. Sadly that wasn't the case and it seems like the dev team just didn't have the resources needed to make what was touted as a big triple A title or they just didn't have a fully fleshed out idea of what they wanted this game to be.For starters the story is pretty overly simple but it's hampered by the lifeless characters and annoying overbearing narrator. There was also a clear emphasis on choices but no choice you make in this game ever matters. Despite what faction you pick or whether you pick the light or dark choices, this only effects your light or dark aura which allows you to get different abilities. The gear system has some potential but fairly early on I realized it didn't take a crazy amount of crafting materials to make a really overpowered weapon that made finding better equipment feel kind of pointless. Maybe halfway through the game I made a long sword that had electricity and I think some damage mods and I don't think I ever switched weapons again until after I beat the final boss. Also most of the abilities felt kind of half baked and very few of them seemed very impactful.On the surface the open world looks nice but as many others have stated it is mostly empty. There are long stretches between landmarks that are totally empty. On top of this, even the actual structures you can explore a lot of times are bare bones. When you do find lootable containers you are also greeted with quite possibly the most pointless puzzles of all times. Some of them are literally you turning one dial once to point it to a marker, while others are 3 nobs where you turn each dial once to line them all up. They're so simplistic to the point they have no purpose other than to slow you down for a few seconds before getting your gear.The final version of the combat in this game is one of the things that was most disappointing as it was what drew me to the game in the first place. The idea of seamlessly transitioning between melee and long range weapons with the over the top comic book art style looked really awesome in early builds of the game. Unfortunately once you actually play the game you realize there is very little reason to use them in fun and creative ways. Enemies that can deal a bunch of damage are best dealt with by staying at range and spamming gun abilities. Enemies that can't deal a ton of damage or that have weaker health pools can typically be dealt with by mashing up close with a good melee weapon and endlessly staggering them until they die.Finally the bosses, specifically the 4 worldeaters which are your main objective in the game, are terribly designed. They're all dealt with through vehicular combat that is a bit clunky and all essentially boil down to shooting endlessly at their weak spots until they die. It seems like they were more concerned with making them these huge epic set pieces than actually making them enjoyable to fight.Buried somewhere in this mess of a game is a good idea that could have been a breath of fresh air for the open world action/adventure genre but it totally missed the mark. I'd be interested to see the next project this group comes up with if they can get the proper funding, time, and cohesive vision of what they want to do.;Not Recommended;16.2;31/07/2022;227;3

THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;»Oh shut up! You command nothing but my scorn and you will know my fury soon enough...«— Fury🔴 Cons🟢 ProsCombat can at times feel unfairExecutions are gone (not counting DLC)Fury starts out uncharismatic   The Sin fights could use some varietyNo mapPoorly designed fast travel menuGreat variety of skills and upgradesNimble and visually stunning combatGreat progression and increasing power fantasyExcellent backtracking and shortcutsBeautiful ApocalypseLots of optional and useful collectiblesEpic soundtrackGreat Add-on content🎮 GameplayThe Darksiders franchise has always been a love letter to gaming in a way, with each title emulating a different set of genres, subgenres and games (which also compliments the idea that each Horseman is unique). Darksiders III continues that tradition and takes parts of its inspiration from the Souls-like and Metroidvania subgenres, in addition to everything else, offering the most punishing and methodical combat so far and an elemental-/ weapon-upgrade-based progression.Combat:Like in the other entries, combat is one of the core gameplay elements. Fury feels a little squishy for a Horseman, especially early on, and the combat requires you to be patient and meticulous, waiting for openings, and dodging at the right times. The Perfect Dodge quickly becomes important, rewarding you with brief slow-motion and allowing for a powerful counter. You notice the Souls-like influences early on, with mistakes being punished swiftly and harshly. However, unlike most games in that subgenre, this one lacks a Stamina-system and has more options to help you out when in a pinch. On the flip-side, some less than fair situations can occur, with enemies attacking you while you're performing your Perfect Dodge Counter, which would be like getting hit during a backstab.As for things that you can do, there's your standard attack, using Fury's whip, the "Barbs of Scorn", which can be used for precision strikes and sweeping crowd control combos alike, as well as a secondary attack, using one of four elemental weapons that you unlock over the course of the game (each with a second variation in the Keepers of the Void-DLC). You can switch between these secondary weapons seamlessly, adding a lot of freedom to the way you play, and each of them comes with their own Wrath-Attack, Dodge Counter, Combos, Charged Attack, and Traversal abilities. Furthermore, you have a powerful transformation, the Havoc Form, that temporarily makes Fury invulnerable, grants her regeneration, while the form is active, and two whips, and lets all of her attacks deal Arcane damage. Initially, the form lasts very briefly and takes ages to fully charge up during regular combat, but using some of the various Weapon Enhancements, the duration can be increased, as can the rate at which it charges up, including a passive regeneration, making certain builds pretty powerful.Sadly, the Executions of weakened enemies, that the series had previously had, are missing. Only the first four bosses in the Keepers of the Void-DLC reintroduce them - too little, too late, as you could argue.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2153887189World Progression:As I mentioned before, the world gradually unlocks based on the Hollows, the elemental secondary weapons, you unlock. Not rarely are you required to backtrack to a previously visited place and unlock a new path from there, but it also opens a multitude of optional, semi-hidden paths up for you that hide optional rewards like Weapon Enhancements, Soul Lurcher Clusters, et al.Traversal abilities that come with the Hollows include a fiery Triple Jump, a static Air Glide, Wall Jumping, walking on water and more, allowing for some unique environmental puzzles and some well-hidden secret areas.🔥 DifficultyThe game offers two different Combat Modes, "Default" and "Classic", as well as five difficulty settings, that you can choose from when you start a new game. "Classic" mode is more similar to the first two games and more forgiving by allowing you to cancel your attacks with a dodge and skipping the animation when using an item. By combining the two modes with the five difficulty settings there is a lot of freedom for players and the game can be fairly easy as well as frustratingly difficult. For those that want to experience the plot and lore first and foremost, Classic + Story/Balanced would probably be ideal, while fans of the Souls-like subgenre might prefer Default + Apocalyptic. Since the game also offers the so-called "Armageddon" Mode (NG+), it makes sense to start out easier and save the harder experience for subsequent playthroughs.📖 Story / PresentationThe game is set after the prologue of the first Darksiders and before the rest of it, 100 years later, much like the second game. It is set before Darksiders II and sees the player tasked with recapturing the Seven Deadly Sins, that have escaped their prison when the Apocalypse happened and have now made Earth their domain. Fury starts out extremely uncharismatic and uncaring but has a big character arc over the course of the game, with many events prompting her to reconsider her stance on certain topics. The voice acting got mixed reactions but I think the voice actors all work really well with what they're given. Due to Fury's constant anger and early disregard of others, her performance probably feels the weakest but even she works well in the context of the story. The cutscenes are all very well made but I saw the "plot-twist" coming very early on.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2153874669💻 Graphics / Art-styleThe graphics of the game are fine, nothing mind-blowing but definitely not bad. What really makes it shine is the art-style and the way it portrays the post-Apocalypse Earth.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2153872955🎼 SoundtrackCris Velasco, the composer of the first game's soundtrack, returns and delivers a score that is just as epic and also manages to be varied and have some very memorable tracks. It's not quite on the level of Jesper Kyd's work for the second game but it's great nonetheless.💯 PerformanceWhile the game was very rough at launch, and still is on consoles, it now runs really well and only really rarely and briefly has the random loading that you may know from video reviews. Some containers lack a texture for some reason but other than that, I encountered no issues.Tested with the following setup:CPUGPURAMAMD Phenom II X4 955 @3.20 GHzAMD Radeon R9 390X8GB🔀 Supports [Alt]+[Tab]: Excellently💰 Business ModelAdd-ons only:There are two paid Add-ons that expand the game, and the game's soundtrack, but no other paid DLCs, items, loot boxes.📋 ConclusionDarksiders III has received very mixed feedback but quite frankly, it's a good game and a good continuation of the series.

THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;As a fan of the previous two games, I'm really, really, really disappointed.Look, it's no secret that the Darksiders games aren't terribly original when it comes to mechanics. They're pretty derivative of whatever's popular in 3rd-person hack n' slash gaming at a particular moment. But this one is shameless. It doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's a blatant ripoff of Dark Souls: you have a rechargeable health restoration item, the souls currency from other games is now lost upon player death and potentially retrievable upon getting back to where you died, checkpoints are sparse and never near the boss encounter, enemies all respawn upon player death, leveling up grants you attribute points, random low-level mooks can easily kill you.And it's that last one that really drives me crazy. Fury is preposterously weak in this game. 2-3 hits from a random mob guy and you're dead. The big, scary horseman of the apocalypse is knocked down by a random baddie with no effort. War and Death could be taken down if you weren't careful, sure, but you had to be sloppy. You had to really let the fight get out of hand, or be in a uniquely difficult fight. But because the devs were dead-set on trying to be Dark Souls, a series that has nothing in common with this franchise, they've decided that you need to be ground down into the pavement at the first suggestion of an injury. It's completely out of step with Darksiders I and II.And the only real way to mitigate these butt-whoopings is with a perfectly timed dodge. That's the central mechanic of all combats, and something you should review in advance if possible when deciding if this game is for you. There's no block, you have no health, and spamming dodge will get you killed more often than not. The whole game rests upon you dodging at EXACTLY the right moment and then countering. That's it. Which could've worked, perhaps, if the game had been built around that idea, but it's not. It's so at odds with the rest of the gameplay that it's frankly kind of startling, like they really did just piece mechanics together without considering the whole. You fight multiple mobs in spaces that are usually confined, hanging over precipices, and/or littered with obstacles, making the all-important dodge mechanic awkward at best and frequently hazardous. On top of that, the game is also inexplicably built around one-on-one targeting like a classic Zelda game. it's the only way to (a) see an enemy's health and (b) deliver the counterattack that goes with the aforementioned dodge. So you spend fights trying to target individual enemies out of large crowds, meaning that enemies you can't see are beating you over the head and killing you within moments. Your attacks don't interrupt or stun enemies often enough for effective crowd control, and you can't tell how you're doing against any of them unless you start individually targeting to see one (1) enemy's health.This game is a mess. Dark Souls is a terrible, terrible source of inspiration for this series. the sensibilities of the former simply don't fit the latter. The result is an awkward, frustrating mishmash of solo fighting and mob fighting that enables the worst of both.;Not Recommended;3.6;6/03/2019;632;20
THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;Hmm, let me start by saying that this is not a bad game. Its just not a great game either. In short:Are you a Darksiders fan? Invested in the characters and lore?     ---Buy this game. Even if you just play it through on {STORY} mode, the story is worth it.Not invested in Darksiders?     ---There are better games to spend your time and money on.StoryThe story and character development are amazing! 10/10 If you like Darksiders, this is pure gold. I love how the characters evolve. There are some great twists too. The writing is great, a lot of what seems sort of cringe-worthy/odd makes sense the second time through.PerformanceIn its current state as of (1/18/20) I'd say it is fine. Never had any issues on my rig other than the occasional 3-10 second freeze when autosaving near Vulgrim after a long session. Also had a shipping container texture fail to load once and so it looked like a grey checkered box. Never saw it happen gain though *shrug*. But after 50hrs of play I haven't had any crashes, major glitches, or frame drops. World/Graphics/PuzzlesBeautiful world here, with great graphics and effects. Very well crafted, interconnected level design. Exploring is fun but can be confusing sometimes. (I will say though devs. If you're choosing to not put a map in, please add way more "THIS AREA" splash screens so we get some sense of what's what.) Puzzles are fun and very true to the Darksiders style. There are however, 2 near the end of the game that left me totally stumped and confused. Luckily the 1st one can be completely bypassed with basic platforming. The 2nd I had to go look up online.CombatThis here, is why I would not recommend this game. Now I like Darksiders, but I LOVE Dark Souls. I have more time played in the 1st Dark Souls game than I do in all the Darksiders games combined and multiplied by 5. I'm no stranger to "hard combat" and "git gud". But this game's combat is not my thing for 3 reasons. Spongy enemies. Everything in this game that is taller than you has a MASSIVE amount of health. Even with upgrading your weapons, stats, and enhancements, combat feels like it takes forever and a day. Having a boss 1-2 hit you and take a while to kill? Please, I'm a Soulsbourne fan. Having every mob taller than you take 6-15 perfect counters to kill, while being able to 2-3 hit you, and there's anywhere from 1-6 of them at a time? ...no. Far far too tedious. Poise. Everything shorter than you has 0% poise. You can combo and spam to your heart's content on the trash. Still takes a bit to kill them, but it gets done. Everything taller than you has 100% poise. You cannot cancel their attack animation. You, the player, Fury, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse has 0-10% poise. Anything and their dog can breathe in your general direction and you're likely to get knocked out of your arcane counter animation, halving your health in the process.Simple isn't always better. The combat in the 1st game was fun, with simple combos that helped you move, control a crowd, or deal with a single target. But it was punctuated with fury moves that let you unleash massive power. 10 bars, 1-5 cost each. The 2nd game had awesome combos with finishers at the end that felt powerful and satisfying to pull off as well as little "Reaper form" animations to add that visual flare. It also had a bunch of moves and passives to unlock via the skill tree that felt awesome to use.This game's combos feel non existent. There are no flare animations, there are no real control or extra damage moves at the end. And moreover, you NEVER want to combo as you never want to be locked in an animation. This game's combat is in essence a rhythm game with a quick-time-event. It can be summed up thusly for ANY number of enemies: Is it shorter than you? Hold [Whip key]/(X). Is it taller than you? Yes? Is it attacking? Dodge, perfectly, and press [Hollow key]/(Y). Is it standing still? Hold [Hollow key]/(Y) release on flash to do a perfect charge attack. Repeat as many times as needed till they die. Which at harder difficulties, will take a long while.There really isn't anymore to it. Your fury moves just burn your whole bar, and while powerful, I found myself "saving" the singular charge, and often felt "wasted" when used. The Chaos form is, much like the 1st game, a straight up god mode that hits like a truck.... but even when spec'd into the proper stats to boost it's damage, it still takes a while to burn things down. The closest game I can think of in terms of this type of combat is Bayonetta by Platinum. However, that game had awesome combos with big damage accompanied by animations at the end of them. And instead of a perfect dodge just letting you counter, gave you more time to pull off said combos. I enjoyed that combat much more so than this. Overall the combat just feels... boring. It takes too long (spongy), requires perfect timing, all for very little pay off. I'd get a new weapon and think: "This looks really cool! Lets go try it out!". Only to realize that it's still the exact same 3 button combat as everything else. War was a tank, Death was fighter/necromancer, Fury is a healthless DDR champion.Summary Again, not a bad game, but not a great game. I both enjoyed and hated my time with it. I'm sure at some point in a few years my OCD will drive me to pound my head against the crucible floor till I get everything maxed and 100% the achievements. But if I wasn't a Darksiders fan? I wouldn't have ever picked this up. There are so many other games out there. Some do loot and exploration better, some do combat better. With all these choices and limited time and/or funds, I'd say there are better games to spend them on.fin;Not Recommended;50.7;18/01/2020;112;1
THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;After the latest patch that added "classic" combat setting I've made more progress in a single session than during past 2 days worth of playtime on "challenging" ("Hard") difficulty. The game is infinitely more enjoyable now, and plays just as expected from Darksiders title - fluid, fast and fun. I highly recommend buying this game If you were previously concerned about the difficulty or the technical issues. Most of them are fixed now, and developers truly deserve our support for listening to the community and reacting fast.;Recommended;28.8;17/12/2018;94;1
THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;Every Darksiders game has different gameplay, but I've ended up enjoying all of them so far. Darksiders 3 feels like a combination of Darksiders 1 and Dark Souls, it brings out a bit of a more serious combat, and the boss fights (On Apocalyptic) can get a bit intense, but once you learn the patterns of enemies and bosses, you'll manage to make your way forward.The game doesn't hold your hand so you will have to navigate on your own and find the way to go. You'll end up exploring more and finding future portals which you have to return to later in the game. The game has more of the same weapon feel as the first game where as you have a set of weapons that you can switch between and upgrade with materials you find in the wilderness. You can also make them better by putting on enchantments. The graphics are good and they manage to keep the same art style as from the earlier games.;Recommended;37.7;2/12/2018;174;8
THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;tl.dr: Recommended? Yes, but only for fans of the series who have a strong enough will to face 12-20 hours of f*d up gameplay.Everyone else, stay away."What were they thinking?" - this is the question that raced through my mind about 70% of the playtime of this game.I loved Darksiders 1. I loved Darksiders 2.I could barely get the will together to finish Darksiders 3.The GoodIt's not a terrible game, it really isn't.The graphics are as nice as they were in the last two games.The story is also as good and finally answers some questions that have been on people's minds since the last two games (no, not all questions, don't worry).The voice acting, sounds, all good.And this is why I would recommend this to people who played Darksiders 1 + 2, if they have a lot of patience for BS gameplay. You won't be disappointed by story, graphics or audio.And thankfully, the game isn't that long so you won't have to chew through the gameplay for days...Everything else is a complete messAnd the worst part? Pretty much every downside of this game was totally avoidable, totally unnecessary - other games, including this game's own prequels, did it better.They changed the gameplay in an obvious attempt to cash in on the Dark Souls hype. Which would have been fine, if they had done it right. But they didn't.While War and Death felt like the awesome entities they are supposed to be, Fury plays like a fragile weakling for almost the entire game. Enemies dish out absurd amounts of damage and the only thing you can do about it is dodge, dodge, dodge,... see where Dark Souls come in?The problem is that Dark Souls works because both normal enemies and bosses telegraph their attacks in just the right way, not too obvious, not too subtle. In Darksiders 3, almost every enemy is either unreadable or an open book.Hitboxes are also a mess. Attacks that really shouldn't hit you do - and vice versa.But your biggest enemy is not something with an HP bar. It is the camera.You are too zoomed in almost the entire time. Fury's admittedly pretty back is just in your way all the time. The vast majority of your time, you fight multiple enemies, but can only see 1 or 2 of them at once. The rest does something behind your back that you can't see, hear or defend against properly - forcing you to go on the most absurd dodging-sprees in recent gaming history. And you'll still die a ton.As if that wasn't enough, the tiny bit of the fight you CAN see will become obstructed by your own effects. Good luck seeing anything when the entire screen is filled with fire, lightning, etc...I am not lying when I say that 70-80% of my deaths were down to the camera and complete lack of overview in combat.And there's more:The game's "RPG" part is unbalanced. With the enemies hitting so hard, health is a complete dump stat. Put no more than 10 points into it, the rest into physical and/or arcane.The progression is also unbalanced - at the beginning, the game is very hard. Near the end, everything is a pushover.There is no map. Good luck looking for humans when going back to previous areas.YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE CONTROLLER LAYOUT (WTF?! IN 2019?!) - and the default layout is weird as hell. Only two puzzles in the game got me thinking, the rest is just too easy. And I suck at puzzles.;Not Recommended;19.3;11/10/2019;222;15

THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;So I managed to get every achievement for this game, and I think I can safely say that this game is the worst in the franchise so far.  Most people whine that it's too hard, and yes, Apocalyptic difficulty will give you gray hairs.  For being one of the horsemen, Fury is pathetically weak and can be two or three shotted by the early game enemies.  But that's not really why this game doesn't match up to the previous installments.First of all, this game feels broken.  The main mechanic of the game, Fury's dodge, seems to work about 80% of the time.  There were many times where I felt I should have activated it, but it just didn't.  I thought it might have been an issue with my controller, but I don't have this problem in any of my other games, not to mention that the same thing happens with Fury's jump.  Sometimes, the control just doesn't respond at all and you wind up falling and taking a big health hit.  Everything else is responsive, so I'm pretty convinced that it's something in the games programming, but given the fact that the dodge has this problem is unacceptable.  Then there's numerous other bugs that I encountered over and over again.  Several times, I got Fury out of bounds even though I wasn't actually trying to do that.  Even though I didn't fall through the world, I somehow managed to go above it with no way back. This meant I had to forcefully restart and sacrifice all the souls I collected.  Was annoying and really something that should have been patched, but looks like it never will be.The real problem with this game is that it just wants to copy Dark Souls without keeping any of the elements that made the previous installments successful.  Gone are the tricky puzzles, maps, dungeons, items, treasure chests, and skill trees.  Instead, fury gets 4 items throughout the entire game called hollows.  Each hollow gives you a new ability and a new weapon.  So you get 4 additional abilities and 4 additional weapons plus a boomerang which is useless in combat.  The amount of content in this game is laughable.  Unless you're an achievement hunter, expect to spend around 10-15 hours on your main play through, and for that play through, expect to die A LOT.  Of that 10-15 hours, you can probably expect 6 of them to be retries of the areas you continue to die on.It's not all bad.  The stuff that's actually enjoyable is the DLC, which means the good stuff is behind a pay wall.  The keepers of the void content was pretty awesome and actually had a bit of the feel that previous games offered.  It's pretty much the only dungeon like area you will get to traverse through.  The crucible is back as well, but I never really found that to be something to write home about.  That is just OK.  Fury's whip gives a Castlevania feel which is a nice touch.But overall, I was really disappointed.  I loved the first two games, but this one was nothing more than a giant dumpster fire.  I'm really hoping that Genesis brings the game back to the roots, but we'll have to see what is done with it.;Not Recommended;48.1;31/08/2019;156;8
THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;I never buy games close to their released because I can't afford it but I did for this to support the devs and continue the series. I understand why some people are upset about the game, since it differs from the previous games in some areas and utilizes some mechanics that are known for being "Souls-like". But I think people are being too harsh on the game beucase it still emphasizes on exploration, combat and metroidvania-like level design. The story and the writing is as good as ever and the environments look beautiful.People should realize that this game was made after the original company went bankrupt, and THQ Nordic is not that big of a company right now, they're in the process so they shouldn't expect a top quality title with AAA features.The combat is more focused on 1-1 fights and as soon as you are fighting with multiple enemies, you're in grave danger (I've played the game on the Apocalyptic diffiulty). Dodging is very important and I didn't really have problems with the dodge window, contrary to what people complain about.Later in the game, I've experienced frame dips and stutters but nothing that made me want to stop playing.In the end, I've highly enjoyed my time with Darksiders III, even more so than I did with the first one. I reccomend buying it not just to support the developers but also because the game is actually quite good.;Recommended;25.5;16/12/2018;123;6
THQ Nordic;Darksiders III;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 75,49;If you’ve played Darksiders III then you most likely have played the first and second one as well. Like the second one Darksiders III opts to do things a little differently and in my opinion it succeeds, but not on all fronts.While the first one was a great Zelda clone and the second one even bigger with an entire open world and a loot system, this third one scales things back a little, this time choosing to be a little more like a Dark Souls game instead. You can tell that Darksiders didn’t do as well as a franchise and therefore the funding seems to have been decreased this time in comparison to the previous titles, but I commend them for trying something different with the obviously smaller budget they had.Calling it a Dark Souls clone would do it injustice - and it would be disrespectful - because it is its own game, set in the Darksiders universe, complete with unlockable moves, hidden loot and well known traditional visual style (this time playing as Fury). It all feels like an actual Darksiders game, except with harder, sometimes even frustrating, combat. But gone are the dungeons of old, as is your mount from the second game and some other small stuff.Traveling through the world feels responsive and all of the areas seem to be well connected, with a boss fight at the end of each area and plenty of items to be found. There’s a bit of (optional) backtracking involved so it still has a little bit of a Metroidvania blueprint in it.Better equipment can be found and unlocked and you have a whip at your disposal when you first start the game. There’s nothing that helps you block damage, instead you have to rely on dodging and trying to finish the fights as quickly as possible (but it isn’t necessary if you don’t want to). Enemies will drop souls that help you level and power up and if you die there’s one more try to retrieve them. die again and they’re forever lost.The boss fights can be difficult, but never as hard as Dark Souls’. With controls that can be changed (one of the first patches gave this option, because sometimes the original movement and layout didn’t quite work as good) and plenty of items that can help in combat it might take you a few tries to take one down, but generally speaking it shouldn’t take you over 5 tries or so.Finishing the game should take you anywhere between 12 and 15 hours I’d say.The visuals of the game aren’t brilliant, but they fit the style of the Darksiders games for sure. Fury seems be nicely animated.The voice acting is also solid, with a few enemies here and there speaking in an over-the-top manner, but also making it seem more like a spectacle than it actually is in the process, which is a positive.I didn’t really have any issues, except for a few issues where the camera didn’t do what it was told. And the controls which were a little weirder in comparison to 1 and 2, but that issue was quickly solved with a patch.The big question is: would I recommend this third Darksiders game? Yes. The combat may be hard(er), but it’s also quite enjoyable once you get into the flow of the game. It’s a smaller, tighter game in comparison to the previous titles, but that doesn’t make it any worse. In fact, it was kind of refreshing to play something a little more direct, a little more linear, after all of these open world games the past couple of months and years.If you enjoyed this review please consider following me: curator page;Recommended;14.1;12/09/2021;59;N/I

THQ Nordic;Wreckfest;Action, Indie, Racing, Simulation, Sports;R$ 82,45;Yo. I can see alot of confusion in the reviews so let's clarify a few things.1: This game is optimized and works with both amd and nvidia gpu's. Anyone who can't get decent frames but have a pc above the minimum requirements are messing up their settings. Not a shred of doubt in my mind about that.2: You CAN hit the AI's without getting taken out yourself. Quite easy. You need to know basic things about a cars weight and for example that if you smash into the back of the you'll take the most damage. Because your just hitting his trunk, but your doing it with your cars engine. Just because your car has a health bar it doesn't mean that only how hard you crash matters. You have specific weaknesses and parts can be broken. My tip is: Don't expect to be a pro derby racer from the get go, learn to know your car and work your way there.3: When it come to reviews and especially negative ones, always keep these two in mind when you read a review. First of all, if someone has less than 5 hours in a racing game and write a negative 3 page review. It's rarely worth reading because their opinion is easily worth more to themselves than it will be worth to you. Second of all, if someone with 50+ hours writes a review on release, ALWAYS READ IT. But keep in mind that these reviews can be sourpusses that are disappointed a game didn't go the direction they wanted. Though the game can still be great.;Recommended;43.9;15/07/2018;236;9

Guns, poisons, traps, dynamite: they've got it all, and a pun and a joke to go with it!Seriously though, it's a great game. However, the store page has a Real Time Tactics tag, and honestly, that's pretty misleading. You will spend a huge amount of time crouched in bushes waiting for patrols or analyzing vision cones until you can execute a perfect strategy, but if you screw up, you're not going to have a chance to really deal with the consequences, because even if you survive, the mission will have just gotten harder. So you'll probably just reload a save.On that note, you will save scum a lot. And I mean a lot. All the damn time, really. More than you can possibly imagine. Let's put it this way:When using mouse and keyboard, there is a top bar that shows you the hotkeys for quicksave and quickload, at all times.There is a tip on the loading screen about the importance of quicksaving.There is a bold and blatant message, in the tutorial, about how it is intended for you to save and load frequently.There are replays at the end of a level, and those replays show you a save and load count.The game will remind if you haven't saved for over a minute. Literally, every single minute, it will pop up with a HUGE dialog saying "maybe save your game, dummy". And you should. I set this to 10 minutes, because it was annoying and because I built up a reflex to just press the quicksave button literally every time I did anything that didn't result in a fail.Obviously, the devs intended save scumming to be an integral part of the gameplay. The result of this is that it feels a lot less like real time game and a lot more like a puzzle game with an undo button.I still highly recommend it, though.The graphics are fantastic, in that every level felt unique and thematically appropriate. The voice lines are fantastic, to the point that many levels have entirely unique voice lines for that one level, which really gives each level a unique atmosphere (the flirting lines in the hangover mission were by far my favourite). The music is great. The level design is great, in that there are many different ways to progress, and your merry band of sociopaths has plenty of tricks to try.I highly applaud the devs for not tacking on some sort of RPG progression. Your characters are just who they are, and their abilities are set. This gives the game a very clean and sleek feel.My biggest complaint is that the missions are really long. I was imagining something like 30 minutes to 1 hour for a mission, but it's more like 1-3 hours, which can get pretty tedious if you have other things to do.The interface with mouse and keyboard can be very clunky. It doesn't always behave as you expect, and some of the functionality is hidden.I have other complaints, but they are mostly just matters of personal preference, which is to say that you should definitely play this game if it looks even remotely interesting to you.;Recommended;77.1;2/07/2021;82;1
THQ Nordic;Desperados III;Strategy;R$ 24,50;Desperados III is a real-time tactics stealth game with a rich story, that tells us a story of John Cooper, his gang, and their sweet revenge. Basically, this game is a prequel to the classic Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive game despite the confusing number III in its name.   Pros: + Awesome real-time tactics mechanics+ Stealth approach is more than rewarding+ A huge amount of the content+ Five different well-written characters with useful abilities that the player has to use wisely depending on the situation+ A captivating story that is interesting to follow+ Thoughtful level design+ High replayable value+ Challenges that are really interesting to complete Cons: - Some levels take a lot of time complete, around 2-3 hours- Reloading saves feel tedious sometimes - Repeating character replicas can become a bit annoyingPlaying Desperados III was a really exciting experience for me because the original game was one of the first games I have played on PC when I was a kid back in 2001. As you can probably guess, gaming then was completely different than it now - we never had a library with thousands of different games, usually, we were limited to a few games, that we had to replay again and again and again. I never had the luxury to rage quit the game, so I had to think a lot of how in order to progress with the story.And Desperados was my first ever experience with real-time tactics games and I will never forget those moments. Constantly saving and loading, trying different approaches, consulting with my schoolmates - it was awesome. The reason why I am telling you all this, is because Desperados III brought me exactly the same experience, same memories from my childhood and I couldn’t be happier in this situation. Everything that I used to love in the original games has been saved in this prequel, so if you are the veteran player, don’t you dare to miss Desperados III. Story Desperados III tells us the story about John Cooper, a rough bounty hunter who has to revenge for his father’s death. During his journey, he meets a company of desperate characters with their own story, motives, and the reason to stay with John Cooper. So, in terms of the story, the main goal of Desperados III is to tell the player how everything started and how John met his gang members.  Gameplay The game is presented as an isometric real-time tactic game, where the player has to control different characters in order to complete the level. Each level can be completed in a loud or in a quiet way, however, the stealth approach is much more rewarding and it causes fewer problems for the player. During certain levels, the player has to control only one character or it starts with one character, and then another character joins a bit later. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2141211666Every single character has their own unique abilities that are hopeful during certain situations and the player has to figure out how to use them properly. The way the game introduces the new character to the player is magnificent: it starts with a short story of what happened to them and then, the whole level is dedicated to that character and it’s designed to be completed by using the abilities of this character. This kind of approach lets the player to learn the character and to understand how to play with him.My favorite part of the game is the design of levels - they are extremely huge and thoughtful, the developers made everything to let the player finish it in a lot of different ways using different methods, where the player can go quietly or go loud. Most of these levels take a lot of time to complete, around 2-3 hours and this can be a problem for some players, I believe. Usually, the main reason why it takes so long to complete the level is probably the mistakes that the player will do during the playthrough. Speaking of me, I was constantly spamming F5 and F8 buttons that are obviously responsible for quick saving and quick loading respectively, simply because there were always some enemies that were appearing out of nowhere, spoiling everything for me.After the mission is done, the player can check on the results of the mission: the map with the movement of the characters, the number of saves and loads that have been executed and how many enemies each character killed. For example, one of my games has 103 saves and I loaded the game for 79 times. I realized that the whole concept of the game and my approach to it didn’t change too much since I was playing it as a kid back in 2001: I kill one, maximum two enemies and then I do an emergency save just to make sure that I won’t be forced to do it again if I fail on the next pack of the enemies. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2141211792I can’t even describe you how satisfying it is when you can’t understand how to fool the big pack of enemies and to bypass them and then when you finally find a solution. Every single enemy has a cone of their viewing area divided into two parts: a solid one closer to the enemy and a striped one, a bit distanced from the enemy’s eyes. The solid area is the place that has to be avoided by any means if you don’t want to be spotted by the enemy and the stripped area only lets the character move around the enemy in a crouching position. If the player will stand for a long period of time in the stripped area, the enemy will trigger the alarm. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2141211727Desperados III has a huge amount of content, including 16 long missions and 5 challenges that can entertain the player for a few more hours. This game has a pretty high replayability value, because it really differs a lot when the player switches to the higher difficulty. Every single level has special badges and unique tasks that the player has to complete in order to get them and this is something that will make the player stay in the game for a few more hours. I finished the game on the normal difficulty, some of the missions I was able to complete on the high difficulty and when I finished the game completely, I instantly started it all over again to try it on Desperado difficulty. Frankly speaking, after finishing the game and knowing everything on each level, I found it much easier to play even on this highest difficulty. Graphics Desperados III has a pretty pleasant graphics, this game never tries to impress the player with it, but it just the does the job in the right way. The game has short cutscenes during the levels and between them, however, they are all made on the source of the game.  Sound  The soundtrack in this game is simply amazing and it definitely fits the atmosphere of the game. Every single character of the game is dubbed by the professional actors. My biggest issue with this game was repetitive replicas of each character which became annoying especially after loading the same save for a few times in a row. Conclusion Desperados III is an extremely quality game that is definitely worth picking up especially if you tactical games heavily based on stealth mechanics or used to play Desperados games in the past. It can be challenging at first, especially on the highest difficulties, but once you get into the mood of the game, it will become much easier. The great thing is that it has pretty high replayability value and it’s interesting to try new approaches in completing the level. Enjoy!

THQ Nordic;Desperados III;Strategy;R$ 24,50;Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

With a campaign that took over 40 hours, gorgeous graphics, and a soundtrack that is comparative to John Williams, Desperados III is one crazy adventure. There are 16 levels, and each feels unique and different from the last. This game will force you to think in new ways, adapting to different scenarios in real-time. There is a great deal of replayability here, with countless challenges for each level, such as not using any of a certain character's skills or taking a difficult route.

THQ Nordic;Desperados III;Strategy;R$ 24,50;"Bill was a good man, couldn’t hurt a fly. Beat his wife like there was no tomorrow, but who doesn’t." Desperados 3 represents a real-time tactics game, developed by the company Mimimi Games and published by the company THQ Nordic. Another notable game of the development studio is Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun.  Pros & cons: ++ Conduct your team as one unit, and choose your own style in completing each mission. full stealth or all guns blazing. As a fan of Old West gunfights, I prefer an action oriented approach, in which two colts and one sawed-off shotgun take care of the negotiations.+ Five different characters come together to participate in a solid revenge story. My favourite one is McCoy. a ruthless mercenary with a soft spot for his companions. And before he reminds you, let me do it for him: It’s Doctor McCoy.+ The various challenges for each level increase the replayability, considerably. Or in other words, my achievement OCD has been triggered. - Towards the end the levels become too large. For future projects I would recommend several smaller maps in between the bigger ones, in order to loosen up the whole thing. Summary: Mimimi Games has already proven to me with their prior title, that they understand what is needed for a well-refined, tactical game. And it pleases me to see they have improved their craft with this instalment.Recommended for fans of commando units and Wild West standoffs.

505 Games;Control;Action, Adventure;None;♦️ Control  Control  is Remedy Entertainments newest game and I dare say their best game yet. It is an amazing blend of an interesting story, gameplay that is just pure fun, and visuals to compete with the likes of H:ZD and RDR2. Story & Characters  Narrative → Control starts you off by just dropping you into this alien but strangely familiar world and leaving it up to you to find answers to the many questions you will have. You take control of Jesse Faden who is on a mission to find the answers about her brother's whereabouts, but quickly it becomes a daunting task. As you are assigned director of the FBC relatively early in the game and your duties become much more convoluted. Thankfully as you play on and learn more about this world some pieces of the puzzle start to click and it starts making sense. → Really the focal point about Control's narrative is learning about the FBC and their strange ways through cutscenes and collectibles. Don’t worry if you’re not a fan of reading, as just paying attention to cutscenes and dialogue I was able to comprehend the story. I won't say too much but Control has a great narrative once you fully understand the concepts of this world.   Characters → The characters in Control are arguably pretty forgettable except for a select few. But the characters that are memorable are as convoluted as the narrative and I mean that in a good way. Jesse Faden is about as confused as you are until things finally start clicking, you learn about her past and grow with her along her journey. There are many secrets to be found about the FBC which reveals crucial information and will answer questions you might have. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2246470170 Gameplay  Combat → The combat in Control is my favorite aspect of the game and plays extremely well on mouse and keyboard. As you progress through the game you gain abilities that allow you to take over enemies, levitate, and more! Using these abilities along with your selection of weapons just feels natural. As you master the combat you will effortlessly tackle enemies using a variety of weapons and abilities. → Controls combat is high paced action that requires you to use tools at your disposal to react accordingly. It also is open to playstyles that you feel more comfortable with, whether it is staying behind cover and taking control of enemies or zipping through the battlefield at high speeds causing mayhem. Difficulty → The combat is only as fun as the challenge the game provides you in my opinion and with no difficulty settings it has to be done well. And I would say the difficulty is suffice to offer a challenging experience while not leaving you overwhelmed. Enemies have a variety of types that each require thought on how you will defeat them. Weapons → There are five weapon types to choose from depending on which you favor. From normal pistol shots to room destroying charge shots. This may seem like an underwhelming amount of weapon choices but taking into account other abilities and the countless number of mods to enhance your weapons it feels like the perfect amount. Basically choosing two from a pistol, shotgun, smg, sniper, or a rocket launcher and all are viable picks with the right mods.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2303944426 Character & Weapon Mods → So you got all your abilities set and your favorite weapons picked. What now? Well mod them of course, depending on how you choose to play there is a wide selection to choose from to enhance certain aspects. Ranging from + x% damage while aiming to quicker energy recharge rates this allows you to fully build into your select playstyle. Think of this as sort of the crafting aspect to Control, finding resources to upgrade the mods you can craft and actually crafting mods will require a heap of resources. If that is not your cup of tea these mods also can drop randomly from enemies. Thankfully these mods actually feel like upgrades, instead of minor stat boosts like other games these mods offer game changing enhancements. Side Content & Collectibles → I am not usually a fan of side content in my games as they are usually just a waste of time, but some of the side content in Control is actually pretty entertaining. There are various side missions that have their own arcs and exposition that are a great way to spend more time in this world. Included in the Steam version you also have access to ‘The Foundation’ and ‘AWE’ expansions, which are as solid as the main game. Collectibles another aspect I dread in games is another surprising treat. I actively looked out for collectibles as they often provided an explanation to certain events in Control and more. Overall, if you are a fan of what the base game provides there is plenty to sink your teeth in after the credits roll. Visuals & Sound  Visuals → The visuals in control are only to be described with the word ‘outstanding’. While other visually impressive games have a stylized art style, Control tries their fight at ‘photorealism’. The textures are crisp and in detail with an amazing lighting system utilizing RTX creates the visual candy that is Control. Not only does it do a great job at representing reality in a game, it also has a great physics system to accompany it. Ripping concrete off supporting structures or slamming a desk into a wall never gets old. The environment and objects react amazingly to the mayhem you will cause. Sound → The sound department is also no slouch in Control, it finds a great way to compliment what is happening on screen. From the satisfying destruction to the environment to the blast of your pierce all sound top notch. And the ambient sounds paired with a lovely soundtrack only intensify the mystery surrounding the narrative.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2303945272 ♦️ Conclusion In conclusion Control is an amazing experience that is a must buy especially at the sale price of $19.99. It offers adrenaline filled gameplay, a precise narrative, and brought together with next level visuals. There is a reason this game has been highly praised over this past year, it is certainly worth your investment at this sale price.

505 Games;Control;Action, Adventure;None;After playing it to its full extent, earning all the Achievements and engaging with every single lore piece, I can safely say that this is one of the gaming masterpieces. The gameplay takes a while to take off, but after a generally boring first few hours, new abilities and weapons start coming in a steady stream together with the story picking up intensity. Each combat upgrade (ability and weapon) shakes it up quite a bit. Once you gather them all? The game becomes one of the best action-adventure games with real powerful combat. Basically imagine Star Wars but better + phenomenal gunplay. Sounds epic right? Because it is.The story, characters and lore are so deliciously written. Some things can go over your head if you're not immersed enough. The devs made sure that you are, though. The atmosphere, art, graphics and even the "miscellaneous" docs you can pick up and optionally read are masterfully crafted, and fill in the world real nice. It all hits ESPECIALLY hard if you're an SCP fan or generally of horror and secret labs and that good stuff.It even has its touch of quirk and humor which really got me smiling/laughing at times.

505 Games;Control;Action, Adventure;None;First and foremost: As someone who loves a game with great atmosphere, I can recommend Remedy's Control wholeheartedly. This game absolutely bleeds style and a sense of otherworldliness. The sound design is exceptional, lighting and particle effects look absolutely fantastic. The design of the setting, too, is carefully crafted—lots of sharp angles, lots of really deliberately selected color palettes in each scene. You can tell the minds at work designing this world had a specific aesthetic quality they were going for, and I appreciate that. They've succeeded in spades, although some of the hamfisted referential treatments inspired by governmental bureaucracy were a bit hokey for my tastes.Apart from the artistic design of its spaces and lighting, the game is an absolute powerhouse technically, particularly with its ray traced lighting and reflections (check out the reflection of the desk lamp on the whiteboard—chef's. freaking. kiss.) Ray tracing is utterly amazing and some of the graphics I've seen in this game are unmatched by any game I've ever played. Slick, oily gray hallways whose only sources of light are cream-colored desklamps pouring through plate glass. a sickly looking industrial maintenance room lit by wan, elegiac yellow-greens. or inky basalt corridors bleeding with the warm orange glows emanating from the larger room ahead. The stuff they do with lighting in this game is absurdly gorgeous, with a touch of the morbid and weird. I love it. In general, it looks incredible. but I did have to rely a lot on DLSS (Nvidia's cutting edge AI upscaling technology) to do some heavy lifting, and its implementation in this game is not perfect. There are certain instances where textures are mucked up by DLSS, which seems that it can't quite manage full resolution images in certain cases. namely with certain paintings on the wall, and some decals which appear regularly. You're going to want to play in DirectX 12, though, and enable DLSS despite these issues, because ray tracing makes this game look so incredible that it's worth the drawback. I ticked down shadow resolution to help with framerate, but left most other settings on Medium to High. I am playing on a I9-9900K @ 5.0ghz and an RTX 2080 Super at 1440p and saw between 60-80 frames per second with mixed Medium/High settings. Your mileage may vary.If you're looking for a good third-person action shooter, you're going to love this. The game seems to balance its pace between exploration—in which you exist within this compelling, affecting atmosphere and learn more about the lore behind the game's events—and all-out gun battles with challenging enemies, including boss fights that should satisfy most players. There's a significant ramp-up in difficulty here from other shooters you may be used to, and that leads me into my biggest criticism of this game.The checkpoints. Oh, those darn checkpoints. Those buggers.For some background: I hate checkpoints. I hate them universally and I hate them fiercely. I wish they didn't exist. I wish every developer allowed me the opportunity to quicksave whenever I wanted—as many games do.Checkpoints are always bad in my book. But! Sometimes checkpoints are not horribly, experience-destroyingly bad. Unfortunately with Control, this is not the case. Your checkpoints are limited to certain areas which feature an object you must interact with (called 'Control Points'), and the setting tends to be a bit convoluted and not so easy to navigate. While this imparts a genuine, lived-in feel for most of the game, it really becomes frustrating when you spend a lot of time hunting for goodies, checking all the nooks and crannies and not paying much attention to where you are... Only to get killed and have to respawn across the entire level to where that one point you saved at was, back 45 minutes ago, with barely a grasp of the route you just took to get where you just were.These checkpoints are putridly awful because, not only do you have to traverse across territory you've already seen, but you've now got to fight additional peon enemies to get back to where you were. I'm all for challenging the player and punishing them when they make a mistake, but so much of my enjoyment of Control came from being fully immersed in its weird, creepy atmosphere, and helped along by its incredible visuals. Many times I found myself manually walking, fully in character, trying to figure out what the heck was going on here. When I died and was forced back to where I was half an hour ago, I was immediately pulled from the engrossing experience I was having and simply sprinted through these amazing environments, no longer caring about it and just wanting to get back where I was. It wasn't something like in From Software's Dark Souls, where each route was a challenge to be overcome by learning more and more—rather, in Control, it's a jarring interruption filled with disposable enemies, and dying, instead of being a learning experience, only served to make the gameplay a jagged, regular shift between being fully immersed and doing busywork walking from place to place. It seems the devs insisted on aping the bonfire system from Dark Souls without realizing what made that system so compelling and addictive.This is a problem solved relatively easily. Checkpoints in Control are too few, too far between, and, in my opinion, it harms the experience as-is. A simple way to fix this would be to rely on a more precise, arbitrary checkpointing system rather than the rigid system in place. Remove the respawn functionality strictly tied to Control Points, and use them just as fast travel beacons and level-up hubs (which they already feature), and simply spawn the player at the beginning of the room before which they just died, and allow them to continue their progress sans tedium. But perhaps this would make the experience a bit too easy? Again, your mileage may vary! This may not bother you, but it substantially harmed a lot of the experience for me. I'm a bit embarrassed to say I've used the Assist mode more than once to bypass these frustrating instances so I could get back to doing what I enjoyed most in this game: Wandering around, being weirded out, and being constantly made tense by this wonderfully crafted setting. I know, I know: I'm not a real gamer. I'm a disgusting loser and I should get good. Noted.Despite this criticism, if you're looking for an action-packed technical specimen of a third-person shooter, a graphical work of atmospheric art, or a weird, creepy story penned by Sam Lake which will keep you guessing, you should pick this up. It's worth it—if your machine can handle it, and if you can handle its putrid checkpointing!Feel free to follow my Curator page if you like my reviews.;Recommended;16.5;27/08/2020;145;4

505 Games;Death Stranding;Action, Adventure;None;I could write you a meme review: "Norman Reedus and the Amazing Feetus Reconnect America's Internet One UPS Package At A Time."  I won't.  Not after the last two days.  I want to tell you a story about a motorcycle and the Waystation at the End of the World.     (spoiler free)I had just moved on to the second map chunk of the game and as I steeled myself to set out into new territory I stopped to check communal equipment locker.  A motorcyle had been left behind by another player, Logick: Logick's long-range reverse trike.  With 15 or fewer hours on my save file, I pulled it from the shared garage, thinking about my good fortune.  A ready-available bike with a double-size battery.  Surely it would serve me well for a few runs before I swapped it out with something else.I would go on to put a total 90 hours on my save file, and cross the largest, most varied map of the game over and over and over on Logick's trike, secure in the knowledge that it would get me to where I was going and back home every time.  You can give "Likes" to other players' equipment and structures to show your appreciation, and Logick earned over 3000 likes from me through the trike alone.  It would become the single vehicle I used the most, by an enormous margin.The moment I lost Logick's trike was heart-wrenching.  I was attempting a risky river crossing, sure as I had been every time before that Logick's trike would see me through.  I failed.  I lost Logick's trike and my cargo to the river's current, and as I scrambled to recover my load from the current, Logick's trike was gone without a trace.  This piece of essential equipment I had borrowed from a stranger I would never know, that had carried me through hours of gameplay, was gone in an instant.  I pressed on.  There wasn't anything else I could do.About ten minutes later, a notification appeared on my screen: "A reverse trike has been recovered from a river".  I opened my map to the discovery that Logick's trike had found it's way to the shore, and while it was in very bad shape, it still had a mostly full battery.  I couldn't spare the time to turn around, so I would have to trust that it would be there when I returned.  The better part of an hour later as I tore across the landscape on foot, no cargo to weigh me down, Logick's trike came into view, smoking, on the riverbank where I had attempted the crossing.  Nearly broken, but with a full battery.  I coasted into the nearby distro center on single-digit durability, and finally let out a sigh of relief.  Logick's trike was back in the garage, safe and repaired, ready to go on the next delivery with me.That one trike, in theory entirely replaceable, was my second most valuable piece of equipment.  On the final trek back across the whole of the map, I rode Logick's trike in a reverse-tracing of the path I had first taken while riding west.  With it's unfailing reliability, it brought me the whole way back.  I crossed the map perhaps dozens of times, hurtling through some of the worst hostile territories in the game, over mountain foothills and rivers, on that one trike.  I couldn't take it any further than the mountains, but it would be waiting for me for the return trip.As I approached the end of the game, beyond the reach of Logick's trusty trike, after hiking through the worst terrain the game had to offer with the singular largest load I had ever moved as part of one of the story-line related deliveries, sneaking through an enemy camp and even being shot at, I finally reached my objective.  Sitting there, listening to the game's soundtrack, I looked around the area.  Scattered over the immediate vicinity was a safe house, a charging station, and a shelter, each built by a different player, with materials contributed by who knows how many others to help upgrade and repair them.  We, as a community, had put together a waystation, here at the end of the world.  One last stopping point before the final push, a chance to breathe easy and ready up.  Every single one of those structures had been brought here, through hostile territory, by players spending their own precious materials, knowing full well they would likely only benefit from this effort for a few minutes at most.  They did it anyway, because they knew it would be there for the others who came after them.We were all just ships passing in the night, unable to interact beyond simple expressions of thanks, notifications reading "Player _______ has used your structure and sends their appreciation.  __ Likes received" in the bottom left of your screen, and yet we had provided for each other nearly everything you could have needed, then and throughout, be it a trike, a charging station, shelter from the rain, or something as important as a place to rest and repair your vehicle.  It's all just zeros and ones, code and pixels, and maybe it's silly, but knowing that there were people who went out of their way to help those who would come later, and being able to be part of it, contributing materials to that waystation, to roads, and building a zipline network that would become a highway, it reminded me of the good there is is the world.  This game, and its community, will help rebuild your faith in humanity if you let them.I cannot recommend this game enough.And Logick, if you find this, thank you.  Your trike carried me through so much of this game.  It took its lumps traveling with me, but I made sure it always came back, same as it did for me, and I made sure to store it in the garage after that last ride.;Recommended;90.0;3/12/2022;760;16
505 Games;Death Stranding;Action, Adventure;None;“I’m very prone to loneliness,” said Kojima. “I think there are similar people around the world — especially gamers. … When they’re alone playing video games in their living room, they don’t feel like they fit into society or their community. So when people play this game they realize people like them exist all over the world. Knowing that even though I’m lonely, there are other people like me — and that makes you feel at ease. That’s what I want people to feel when they play this game.”;Recommended;5.7;2/04/2022;873;15

505 Games;Death Stranding;Action, Adventure;None;PATIENCEMany players, including myself years ago, struggled to finish the game. My advice: focus on the main mission path initially. Avoid difficult side missions until you:    1. Unlock the chiral network in the area (other players' signs and buildings will become available after this).    2. Unlock guns and grenades.    3. Unlock vehicles, power suits.Without these, the game can feel like self-torture, and you might give up early as I did years ago on the PS4.The Concept is PhilosophicalThe game might not appeal to everyone, especially those seeking instant gratification. Years ago, I bought the game on its PS4 release and dropped it quickly because I didn't understand its message and focused too much on side missions before unlocking all the QoL features.Today, with our fast-paced lives filled with instant gratifications like TikTok and short content, "Death Stranding" stands out. The game teaches patience and the value of investment, leading to great satisfaction and results.GameplayThe game is highly difficult at the start but becomes easier and less hassle-filled over time, which is a good thing. Initially, it's 75% hiking sim and 25% horror. If you're looking for constant action like in "Resident Evil" or "Call of Duty," this game isn't for you. It’s a slow burn that becomes immensely satisfying. After passing the first area, the game becomes significantly more rewarding. You’ll unlock tools for faster travel, such as semi-fast travel options, special suits, and vehicles that help carry more loads and run faster. Connecting the chiral network in any area unlocks other players' buildings, which is a huge help.What I LikeThe game doesn't give you everything at once. It gradually unlocks great features, keeping the game fun and engaging even after hours of play. It makes all those helpful items you get from the investment actually meaningful.;Recommended;95.3;25/05/2024;196;1

505 Games;Death Stranding;Action, Adventure;None;Long story short: When the local postman tries to fix your internet connection.Death Stranding is a 3rd person adventure/walking simulator/survival horror coming from the creative mind of Hideo Kojima and his new team. You deliver packages in this game while trying to avoid the dangers of the road which includes the terrain itself, the weather, bandits and also ghosts.The story is more or less straight-forward. You're playing as Sam Porter Bridges, a courrier who's given the task of connecting settlements to the Chiral Network, which is basically the equivalent of our own internet but with some twists. The gimmick is that in this world, the concept of death itself has been thrown out the window and ghosts roam the lands between these settlements. I won't say more about the story as a big part of the journey is to uncover the mysteries of this world and why things are the way they are.On the graphic side, this is peak level of details for our current generation. Beautiful landscape, nice colors and some of the best face details I've seen in years. The only game who comes close to this amount of detail overload is Red Dead Redemption 2. Amazing cutscenes, fluid animations, this game has it all.As for the sound and music, it's excellent. Carefully handpicked songs played at precise moment helps elevates the emotional scope of these moments when you've almost reached your destination. Excellent voice acting by everyone. Neat sound effects for menus like the MGS series. What I dislike is how some songs are cut short because sometimes you deliver stuff very fast, so you only hear a brief segment of these songs. Second is the absence of the Music Player when you're out in the field. That's a big L right there. Besides these 2 little nitpicks, it's all good.On paper, Death Stranding might sound like the most basic and dull game ever made. This was my mentality when I first heard about this game. It isn't as exciting as blowing up 100 zombies per second, yet it is a very zen and relaxing experience. In this day and age where online games and microtransactions rule, only a madman would attempt to make a game like this and I guess Kojima was up to the task for the sake of originality and creativity.The art of balancing Sam's cargo weight while navigating slippery sloppes is realistic and at the same time, so goofy and funny. You haven't truly experienced this game unless you took a real bad tumble while being absolutely overweighted. But you see cargo lying on the ground and you STILL insist on picking it up.This is why this game isn't for everyone, especially if you're impatient. The open world/sandbox vibe allows you to do whatever you want, carry what you want and go where you want. This game will teach you to make careful decision and how to take each steps carefully.Note that I omit lot of details in this review because I'd bust Steam's character limit with some tl:dr paragraphs.I highly recommed this game to anyone but beware, you need to walk in here with a different mindset than most mainstream games.A masterpiece that will probably become a cult classic in the years to come. Bravo Kojima, you absolute lunatic.10/10;Recommended;483.0;18/01/2024;232;15

505 Games;Ghostrunner;Action;R$ 81,39;GhostrunnerLong story short - Ghostrunner is quite amazing, but it's not a game for everyone, at least some people would enjoy it a lot more than others.It's a katana-sword melee combat game with tons of platforming/parkour. Technical part is very solid - visuals, sound/music and controls are amazing. All mechanics are fair to the player and almost perfectly polished. There's a lot of cool details like secrets and even talents/perks are implemented in a very creative way here.Ghostrunner is relatively hardcore - you'll die a lot in this game, but at the same time there're no really hard areas to beat if you're using your abilities/cooldowns correctly + checkpoints are generous.I'd say there's too much platforming outside of combat to the point when it starts to be annoying. Shielded enemies mechanic is not fun either. Actually fun, intense and challenging fights are rare, and it's the main reason why I don't really want to replay Ghostrunner after completing it (in 6-7 hours). Maybe I'll replay it again some day.Ghostrunner is a perfect game for people who enjoy semi-hardcore games for speedruns or no-death challenges -- here're more than enough opportunities for it. For everyone else it could be a hit or miss. Again, it's a great game, but an actual gameplay could be very different from what you expected after watching trailers or reading a description. 8.5/10More reviews on our Curator Page;Recommended;7.6;27/10/2020;437;7
505 Games;Ghostrunner;Action;R$ 81,39;The devs owe me a new pair of hands after this..Ghostrunner is all about reflexes, patterns, and timing, it's a very complex game but sure it's rewarding going through it.Personally, i sucked a lot at it, because of some health issues my response time and anything that uses my brain has a snail effect on.The game does have some assisting options (I really appreciate the devs for this), however, i didn't use any of them because i was afraid it might affect the achievements.This game was suggested to me by a friend on the basis of me being a die-hard Hotline Miami fan (and also Shadow Warrior), although, with Shadow Warrior it doesn't have that much in common, the recommendation was spot on.It's a love-hate-joy-anger filled package wrapped beautifully, and i loved it very much. The last few years i kinda became a 'filthy casual' as they say on the internet, and was more into games where you could build your own pace and you could just be lazy around.While this game is totally the opposite of what i've been playing as of late, you can also 'adjust' the pace of it yourself (but just a bit), you can take time to build strategies, cover until you figure things out, and most importantly, you can do things in multiple ways.I tried to play it old-school arcade-ish style most of the time as i didn't want to feel like i am breaking the 'character' :)One thing i really want to talk about is nostalgia. This game brought me back some good memories with even better emotions attached to them, the days of Duke Nukem 3D and all that.I wasn't aware 3D Realms were involved in making this, but when i saw so many ventilators and the ability to use it as a propulsion system, i instantly thought of Duke Nukem 3D.Besides DN3D, i got some Manhattan Project vibes as well, but also other games from that period of time. This game, unexpectedly hit me with a various wave of multiple very specific emotions, and i can't really explain it, but it's good!The graphics are impressive, and the beautiful dystopian world will instantly transport you into another era, a cold and dark one.If there is a sequel, i would like if it was maybe something open-world, because i really the devs' artistic view of a dystopian cyber-punk cold and deserted world.It's been a very long time since i played a game so much for a long amount of time that my hands hurt bad as hell, but i have a smile on my face, and some pride in my heart.The only thing that this game is missing in terms of features, i would've loved if at the end of a (succesful) level you would get a recording of your gameplay (like Superhot had).Oh, and maybe... just maybe... few more auto-save checkpoints.This is all i had to say about this game, maybe i didn't touch some subjects, but i feel it would've been pointless, this is an art piece that doesn't need many words to describe, an art piece that will mean different things to different people.Thanks to 3D Realms' ventilator fetish that brought some memories to me, and all the devs that worked on this project for their hard, beautiful and artistic work.;Recommended;28.0;28/11/2021;192;1

After coming from Blasphemous and Hollow Knight, I completed 40% of the map without dying once in this game. Then I felt playing this way is meaningless, I have to higher the difficulty level.  Sadly the HARD and NIGHTMARE  modes are locked until you finished the game on NORMAL. But there is a way around, a cheat code.

505 Games;Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 78,64;EDIT 2: I've finished the game on PS4. There is a tonne to do in this game for a full 100%. I'll soon be starting my PC playthrough. Recommendation is still up.Brilliant game.My time is low as on steam, as most of my play time is on PS4. I've been playing the PS4 version since the morning of Monday 17th. I'm finishing that version before I complete the game again on PC. I am an original backer and this game is everything I expected it to be. If you're a long term Castlevania fan, expect it to play like Dawn of Sorrow and a bit of OoE. It has all the expected tropes and cool Easter eggs hidden around the castle. The new weapons it has added also helps with varying the gameplay, along with many quests, masteries, and items to craft and complete. Once again, the fake ending appears like in all the other metroidvania games, so don't think you're finished if you defeat "the final boss". There is enough here to pay homage to the original Metroidvania games from years ago, while also adding enough for it to be worthy successor. I still enjoy using my familiars to find little hidden Easter eggs, or using them to find secret breakable walls to find items to upgrade my character. Little note, bring the Faerie familiar to the Piano in the Garden of Silence. Also, the game also adds in two difficulty modes, that increase enemy damage while also mixing up enemy placement. Adding a tonne of replay-ability to the game. Nightmare makes the game extremely difficult, and is fun if you want the challenge.Finally, “13 Free DLCs” are on the way, and plenty of updates including a co-op mode. I will be coming back to this game for sure in the future, like I have with all the other Metroidvania games.If you love Metroidvania then you should 100% be picking this up. EDIT : I did originally want this game to be pure 2D with sprites, however I've grown to like the 3D models use in game.

Just go inside the Screenshot channels of a DECENT AC discord server and look.-There (i cant express this enough) are good and great mods and then there are bad and terrible mods be it tracks or cars etc, im not going to get into detail about because it would take forever to explain but to put it as short as possible there are some mods that look and drive worse than stock AC and there are mods that are just so much fun and everything feels natural u can get lost in this sim for hrs and hrs, just ask around in a DECENT AC discord server or go to RaceDepartment Yes i would recommend this sim to anyone that has a love/ passion for cars but try not get too involved with the some of community, odds are you'll end up in argument with kids or adults who should honestly get off and get a job.;Recommended;5,270.8;13/06/2021;393;13

505 Games;Assetto Corsa;Indie, Racing, Simulation, Sports;R$ 72,02;I'm not very good at reading Steam descriptions. I somehow managed to miss the part where this was a simulator, and believed it would be a Forza-style racing game, or maybe a Gran Turismo experience. I wasn't prepared for the depth of simulation presented in this game. I had no racing equipment, not even a steering wheel. I did not enjoy the game.But here's why it's good anyway.Assetto Corsa is not a game where you jump in, do some drifting and jump out. It's an in-depth driving game with realistic vehicles and handling. It is recommended to get racing sim equipment, but you don't have to. Don't make the mistake I did, and make sure you figure out whether Assetto Corsa is right for you.

I must admit this game is much harder initially, it took me hours to just be able to even drive on track. The AI is very very hard to compete so I still play at the lowest AI difficulty and they can still sometimes pose a challenge to me (using a Controller as keyboard isn't very efficient). So unsurprisingly time trials are a lot easier than races. XDIt's a very unforgiving game since there is no rewind and no dynamic race line (like in Forza).For all new players or arcade racers like me, I would suggest just playing at the lowest AI difficulty, "Gamer" preset and enabling the race line. Initial track and car can be ♥♥♥♥ so don't discourage yourself as you will get better cars in later stages.This game is a sim racer, DO NOT expect More W = Better position!Also check this interesting long Japanese highway project -  Shutoko Revival Project [www.patreon.com];Recommended;17.5;16/11/2022;254;1

Koei Tecmo;Nioh 2;Action, RPG;R$ 249,00;Got severely obliterated as advertised, not disappointed in that field. What I didn't expect was the 100+ hour campaign, with about 80 bosses and a billion ways to defeat them. With the amount of variety and depth you can dive into, and for how brutally challenging it all is, I'm surprised Nioh 2 doesn't have more attention nowadays.Let me put it this way: Nioh 2 is like endurance training at the gym. It only gets heavier and more unbearable as it goes on, testing your resolve and will to go the extra mile. At any point, you could stop. You could give up, say "I did enough, that's my limit", and move on. Or, you could climb that metaphorical mountain, taking all the weight you can, working your way to the third expansion, and the final boss.And if you beat that final boss, the absolute bringer of nightmares that has awaited you for the entire game, it'll feel like the weight of a planet has been lifted off your shoulders. And that's the fun of Nioh 2. the journey, the uphill battle, and that payoff. Now, is the story and world-building that amazing? Objectively, no, but I didn't mind it though. Felt like a Sengoku period Johnny Mnemonic or something, and as someone who actually likes that film for some reason, the story had it's own janky charm.tl.dr: Good, buy it if you want.IF YOU DARE;Recommended;141.4;8/04/2022;192;9
Koei Tecmo;Nioh 2;Action, RPG;R$ 249,00;More Than Just a Souls-likeEver since Dark Souls got popular, many games have tried to emulate the satisfying gameplay the franchise provides. Few manage to do so, but there have been successes. Nioh 2 is one of them. The Power FantasyDark Souls makes you feel small, weak and insignificant. Nioh 2, however, does the polar opposite. The combat oozes with flashy animations and vibrant particle effects, further emphasized by the weapons you wield. You’re a shiftling. Half human, half yokai. How cool is that?You feel powerful. But you aren’t. Below all the cool effects, Nioh 2 is like Dark Souls. Death is never more than a few meters away, and like the title it’s inspired by, the game forces you to look danger in the eye. if you don’t adapt, you won’t succeed. Simple as that.Nioh 2 is one tough game. The first mission feels like an exam you didn’t study for. You barely get familiar with the mechanics before you’re thrown up against powerful yokai and groups of bandits who will shred you apart in seconds. That might sound unfair, but I wouldn’t say it is. It’s a test to see if you’re skilled enough, so to speak. The game gradually throws tougher and more unpredictable enemies at you. I never felt like I could just waltz my way through a mission without much thought. Each area scaled in accordance with my understanding of the game—the game keeps challenging you, but it never goes too far. When it comes to bosses, the game really is a gift that keeps on giving. Every boss fight is well designed, engaging and fair. There’s no Bed of Chaos here. Unfortunately, the difficulty peaks at the third boss fight. Don’t get me wrong, the following are still tough. However, none of them offered the same struggle. I do have a tiny nitpick in regards to the difficulty. Falling into water will instantly kill you, which is too punishing. It would’ve been better if you only lost a portion of your health. Why should I suffer more from a small misstep than the blow of a powerful enemy? It doesn’t add anything. it’s just frustrating. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2445471206Challenging Your ConventionsRarely does a game manage to keep my attention like Nioh 2 did. The game is simply a lot of fun, mainly thanks to its combat system, which will have you pulling off cool combos to take down fierce enemies while trying to manage your ki.Ki is essentially stamina, but it differs not just in name. After an attack, you can perform a Ki Pulse, which will restore a portion of your ki. It’s a simple yet very efficient way of encouraging a careful playstyle. Sure, you could simply hammer away at the enemy, but it’d be at the risk of running out of ki, which would leave you open to attacks. Nioh 2 is a Souls-like, but that doesn’t mean it’s a carbon copy of Dark Souls. The game takes the foundation of that game and shakes it up. The final result is a game that scratches that FromSoftware itch while also differentiating itself, shaping its own identity in the process. If you’re one of those Soulsborne experts, you won’t go into Nioh 2 breezing past every enemy.The game sees you choosing between one of eight melee weapons, each offering a distinct moveset complete with its own combos. You can switch between three stances—low, which allows you to dodge and attack swiftly. mid, which focuses on blocking. and high, which focuses on damage. Each stance alters your weapons’ attacks, so there’s a lot to play around with. That’s only half of it. Remember the half human, half yokai aspect I mentioned earlier? That, of course, also plays a part in the gameplay. Killing yokai will occasionally net you soul cores, which offer different Yokai Abilities. These are special attacks that can deal a good amount of damage. You also have an Amrita Gauge. When it’s full, you can transform into a yokai. It’s a quick power rush, as you can deal devastating amounts of damage during this short period. When all of these elements come together, they result in a combat system that never gets old. Nioh 2 is carried by this combat system. Even something that would normally be mundane, such as grinding if you’re into that, is fun because the combat is. You can use the same weapon for an entire playthrough and never have to consider if you should try out a new one. There’s a lot to like here, but there’s also a bit to dislike…I’m talking about the loot system, or more specifically, the sheer amount of loot you acquire. Nioh 2 has a Diablo-like loot system. I don’t mind that. What I do mind is that I often have to spend a lot of time scrapping the items I don’t need because the game keeps giving me so much loot. Now, I could just avoid picking up everything I find, right? Not really. First of all, choosing which item to take is tricky. Secondly, there’s no way to view an item’s stats before it’s in your inventory. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2445472207A forgettable storyThe game’s weakest aspect is its storytelling. It fails to make you care about its characters. A great example is Tokichiro, your companion who does nothing but tag along with you, always arriving once you’ve disposed of the danger—and yet, he gets half the credit. In trying to make you like him, the game actually makes you dislike him. Initially, he’s set up as the awkward and witty type—a cheap shot at comedy, as nothing he does is funny. The problem with the narrative is that the game doesn’t lend it much time, and when it does, it doesn’t use it well. Everything about it is forgettable—the plot is bland and clichéd, and the characters are unremarkable. It’s a missed opportunity, as the idea of merging historical events with mythology is compelling. I did enjoy reading the lore of the different yokai, but it pales in comparison to Dark Souls’ grandiose tale. The different locations do have small stories behind them, but they’re revealed on a loading screen. they play all of their cards too quickly. It’s a shame, as the locations are fun to explore. Each one is unique due to differing color schemes and unique layouts that urge you to look around every corner. The locations are somewhat linear, but there are still many opportunities to explore off the beaten path. These locations aren't interconnected but instead split between missions. In classic video game fashion, there are main missions and side missions. The latter are mostly remixes of the locations featured in main missions or less memorable areas. I had fun playing them, as they gave me more of what I loved—the combat system. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2445477222Technical DetailsIntel Core i7-10700K, RTX 2070 Super, 16GB DDR4 RAM @ 3200Mhz, NVME M.2 SSD | 1440p  Performance: The frame rate fluctuates a lot. On max settings with DLSS set to Quality, I was able to get 80-120 FPS. Most of the drops occur when there are a lot of visual effects in play.  Polish: There was a time where all UI text disappeared. Luckily, a restart was enough to fix it.  VerdictNioh 2 is an awesome Souls-like that every Soulsborne fan needs to play. The combat is satisfying and offers tons of variety, and the tough enemies will test your skill. Unfortunately, the story is forgettable, and the item management is tedious, but that doesn’t keep Nioh 2 from being a great game.

Koei Tecmo;Nioh 2;Action, RPG;R$ 249,00;Nioh 2 is a fun game that's, in a way, too complex for its own good.It takes the basic gameplay loop of the soulsborne genre, and layers technical action game combat and loot showers on top of all of that. All of this together both makes the game great and overwhelming at the same time.The more technical combat on top of the Souls formula creates a barrier to entry even to veterans of the genre. On top of light and heavy attacks, you've got a bunch of special offensive and defensive moves that you'll want to make good use of to succeed. There's also the youkai abilities you have as a shiftling (half-human, half-youkai). These are a pretty simple matter of having an "anima" (basically mana) bar that you build by hitting enemies. Then you just press a simple button combination to throw out an ability.So far so good.Then we get into the fact that there's three different stances for each weapon, which basically are a matter of how fast or powerful you want your swings to be. Each of these not only have different attack animations, but also have their own set of special attacks, so you need to remember different sets of attacks for each of them. You also carry around two weapons, so you've pretty much got 6 different sets of attacks to keep track of, plus your aforementioned youkai abilities. To make things more complicated, a lot of heavy unblockable attacks are stopped with the "burst counter" mechanic, where you momentarily shift into youkai form and do one of three different type of defenses (parry, dodge, strike) to counter and stagger the enemy. This is based on which guardian spirit you have active, and you can carry around two spirits, which may have different counters, so you need to be mindful of that to know how to use the counter correctly in the moment. Furthermore, burst counter is used with a button combination involving the youkai ability button (which is fine), but doesn't involve the defend button, which is used in normal counterattacks that you can unlock for your weapon styles.Your ki (stamina) also notably regens pretty slowly (even with a relatively light weight class), and to get it back rapidly you'll have to make use of the "ki pulse" mechanic (where you tap a button to recover a much faster regenerating bar). Honestly, I don't know that this really adds much to the game, other than adding some mental overhead. Though, sometimes you might want to forgo the pulse, or use it at a time where you won't get full recovery because you need to stay on the move, so it does add something. I just don't know that it really adds all that much, and there's already a lot of things to keep track of in this game.There's honestly just too much stuff going on, and it makes the difficulty curve of the game incredibly steep in the beginning, as you try to hammer in all the button combinations and controls into your head. I died a lot in the beginning to the fact that I kept pressing the wrong button combination to try to get burst counter out, since I intuitively thought it involved the defend button, which it does not. Overall, I died slightly over 300 times in my first play through of the main storyline, which took some 80 to 90 hours. Well over 200 of those deaths are from the first 50 hours. By the last two main story chapters of the game, I was sight reading the bosses more often than not.On top of all this is managing your stats, which you're used to in a soulsborne game, and also your loot that you're constantly showered in. You'll be sifting through pieces of armor to balance your toughness (poise) and agility (weight class that impacts ki use and regen), among other bonus stats, then selling/dismantling literally dozens of pieces of equipment between missions.The gear curve also seems like it's a little rough in the first play. Unless you know how to build already (which you probably won't if you're a newcomer), bosses will hit super hard and be super hard to hurt. They seem much more difficult than they are later in the game. This may be because I figured out a build by later in the game (and you have more tools at that point), but I'm also pretty sure it's because the gear you get ramps up rapidly toward the end of the storyline. The last main storyline level is recommended for level 114 characters. By that time I had gear that was over level 130, and I didn't do any farming of any kind for it. Thus, I'm pretty sure I was overgeared without even trying to intentionally get gear above the level of the levels I was playing. I'm fairly certain this contributed heavily to my ability to sight read many of the later storyline bosses.Nioh 2 is overwhelming. It was honestly too much for me. I actually burned out 50-60 hours in, and only picked up the game again recently (a year later), picking up where I left off. It's not that the game was too hard, I was beating a level or two every night after work, but it was just too much. One night I just didn't fire up the game to keep going, because I felt I wanted to relax, and this game doesn't fit that bill. That was the end of my run up until recently.There's a lot of things to keep track of in Nioh 2, and it all can make the enemies and levels kind of become pains in the ass. Still, it's all this stuff that also makes Nioh 2 incredibly rewarding. All the tools and options you have at your disposal allows you to come up with a huge number of ways to build you character and approach each situation. Enemies that smashed your face in over and over and over will be common fodder to you later, and you'll face them more and more the further you get (which also contributes to them being a pain, if I'm being honest).Nioh 2 is a hard game. It's not for everyone. not even for all fans of the soulsborne genre. It's incredibly well-crafted and beautiful. It's a lot of fun. Just don't go in thinking this just another soulsborne, because it's not. It's much more than that, and that will be absolutely fantastic for some people, overwhelming for others, or if you're like me, both fantastic and overwhelming at the same time.Also the character creation is great.;Recommended;130.6;11/04/2022;135;2
Koei Tecmo;Nioh 2;Action, RPG;R$ 249,00;This game isn't for everyone. 1, it is hard, often unfair bordering on sadistic. Some of the encounters and bosses seem purposefully designed to not let you have enough breathing room to even attack.2, it's designed around replayability: the whole first new game is basically a tutorial on the basic mechanics, and to have a taste at the different enemy designs. NG+ (and then ++, and then +++ and then there's more, and then there's even more) is where the game shines and you open up build variety and new mechanics (as well as making the game more difficult ofc).If you just finish the game once, you'll probably only see like 10% of what it can offer.That said,Combat is the deepest I've played in years, only thing I could compare it to is the platinum games style of combat (dmc, bayonetta), but more realisticA dozen weapons, with like 20 skills for each, spread out among 3 stances you switch between instantly at willMid-combo weapon switchingdodge, roll, parries, counters, grabsAnd magic spells, and ninja tools, and pokemon attacks you collect from enemy monsters, and a super sayian form when things get trickyAnd tech, for animation cancelling, for new ways to combo, or just for styleWhen you use all of this and combo it together fluidly, the sky is the limitOn top of that, so much loot, tons of gear, tons of bonus sets, a ton of customization, so many builds, all viableBe aware, all of this will be overwhelming and needs hundreds of hours of gameplay to unlock, followed by hundreds of hours of practice to use properly.

Koei Tecmo;Nioh 2;Action, RPG;R$ 249,00;This is not so much a "souls-like", beyond the very surface. It's closer to a Ninja Gaiden game, combined with Diablo's loot systems, with brutally punishing difficulty, even compared to From Soft games. Nioh 2 has more systems and subsystems and loot mechanics than almost any other RPG out there, so unlike Dark Souls, you're actually going to have to put in some work with comparing your equipment, and developing a build that's somewhat unique to you. Play this game if you want more mechanical complexity than From Soft's games are giving you, and more compelling combat than Path of Exile or Diablo are giving you.;Recommended;251.0;24/08/2022;124;1
Koei Tecmo;Nioh 2;Action, RPG;R$ 249,00;TL.DRThree player co-op, main story and most side missions can be played with other playersCustom character creation (male or female)Challenging but rewarding combatGood music overall, sound effects are spot onStory is a fantasy retelling of real events in 16th century JapanRecommend playing with controllerGeneral OverviewTake two scoops of Devil May Cry, a scoop of Ninja Gaiden, and a handful of Dark Souls and blend it up.  You'll get something close to, but not quite like, a Nioh 2 smoothie.  If, like me, you're coming from other souls-like games into Nioh you'll learn quickly the combat is faster but fluid.  Unlike Dark Souls / Elden Ring or other games like them there is less emphasis on dodging - in fact, dodging is often not your best option.  Instead there is a focus on carefully timed blocking and counter attacking.  Fights against strong enemies and bosses are only partly solved by learning the pattern and when you can punish them.  You also need to see what you can interrupt to create your own openings for flowing combo and chain attacks.GoodThree player co-op - easy to setup and jump straight into missions without any weird systems restricting your play.  Some duel side missions are solo only but the main story and most side missions can be played with up to two other players.Graphics are solid, although some environments can feel overly busy.  The character creator is superb and you can create a male or female character, which should be standard by now, but is welcome here.  You will have a hard time making a character who isn't handsome / pretty, as Team Ninja is behind this one.  The cut-scenes are in-engine so your custom character and the gear you have on are reflected in the cut-scenes which is awesome.  The armor and weapon designs range from realistic to leaning deep into fantasy.  All are well modeled with beautiful textures.Music is great, some of the tracks are so epic they'll keep your blood pumping fast as you feel the pressure to move, attack, counter, and destroy.  Sound effects have plenty of clanging metal, weapon into armor crunch, and solid hit effects.Controls are tight and belie their fighting-game roots at times.  Learning the ki pulse, stance switching, and counter system - with slight variations for each weapon type - will take time but is incredibly rewarding once you get into the groove.  Speaking of weapon types, there is a nice variety of weapons on offer for different play styles.  As you unlock the ability and skill tree for each one they develop their own character and feel.  Once the trees are about half unlocked or more the weapons will feel very different.The story takes place in 16th century Japan with some hefty liberties taken with real events to fit in the fantasy elements and your character's role in the alternate history presented.  Keeping track of all the characters can be difficult but fortunately there is a character guide in-game you can consult to keep up with the story as it plays out.The game can be modded.NeutralThe game is difficult and makes no apologies for it.  Some of the duel side-missions are harder than anything the main story will throw at you but the main missions are no slouch, either.  The flip side of the difficulty is the satisfaction you will get as your skills improve and you conquer a challenging enemy or boss.  Be warned, however, the difficulty is no joke and there is no easy option.  The game plays best on a controller, keyboard and mouse not so much.BadThis is a well polished game and most of "the bad" would resolve to nit picks.  With that said, the game wastes no time throwing complex systems at you with barely a tutorial.  It took me some time to wrap my head around the controls as this game will utilize every button on a controller and then some.  The twilight missions use a red filter / lighting system that hides the beauty of the levels they take place in.  I wish you could tone down the effect as they are SO RED.  Some of the music is short repeating loops that can grate after awhile, even though for the most part the music is great.  The aforementioned twilight missions are also the only content that gets level synced, so if you are teaming up with a low level friend on a high level character you will eliminate a huge chunk of the challenge for them and stomp the lower level missions.  With all of the special effects in combat your screen can get cluttered in flashes, sparkles, hit indicators, and more at times.  There are mods to tone this down but the default game can be overwhelming visually at times.Conclusion Nioh 2 is a solid game.  Expertly designed combat takes some getting used to but is very satisfying once you begin to learn and eventually master it.  Three player co-op with custom characters is fantastic.  Even at full price this game is a worthwhile purchase but it sometimes goes on sale and I enthusiastically recommend snagging it at a good price.;Recommended;342.7;6/06/2022;96;2
Koei Tecmo;Nioh 2;Action, RPG;R$ 249,00;Two caveats about the port:1. Many people seem to be having FPS drop issues. Reducing the effects quality seems to fix this for many, but not for all. Personally, I'm not having this issue, but it's something to be aware about.2. The Keyboard+Mouse support has two big issues. First, the lock camera is basically unusable - moving your mouse sideways change your locked target, and you're going to do this by accident all the time while fighting. Second, the game doesn't display prompt icons with kb+m keys, only XBox or PS controller icons. It does support keybinding for most actions, at least. If you don't suffer from the performance drop issues and you prefer or don't mind playing with a controller, then this game is easy to recommend. Very fun and fluid combat, weapons handle pretty different from one another, quite a few different special moves, etc. Though be aware that it's hard to the point that it might feel cheap at times.;Recommended;54.8;5/02/2021;157;2
Koei Tecmo;Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout;RPG;R$ 299,00;I love this game because the balance is a bit off...One character is a big lad with a sword that does a fair amount of damage. Classic. Next is a smaller boy awkwardly swinging a big hammer. Interesting. Then you have the main character, a foolhardy girl learning alchemy. She gleefully chucks tactical nuclear warheads that eliminate every enemy within a five kilometre radius that she slapped together in a pot using a rock, a fruit and a flower.The island is none the wiser about the evolving world-ending power that is growing in their back yard in the form of a group of young optimistic adults.I would recommend to someone who wants to feel like a lazy demigod capable of causing massive damage with minimum effort.;Recommended;59.9;27/07/2020;331;418
Koei Tecmo;Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout;RPG;R$ 299,00;I'm an older RPG player. I played my first computer RPG around 1986. I've played tens if not over a hundred RPGs since then and I'm very happy to be playing Atelier Ryza. This past year has been good for me as far as gaming goes - Disco Elysium, for example, was an especially important game for me.As someone with a relatively full schedule with work and such, it's rare that I take 17 hours to watch or play any media at all, but I'm already at 17 hours for A.R. and I'm looking forward to playing however many more hours there are of it. This is my first Atelier game. I've avoided them in the past because I heard that there was a time limit to them. This is probably my loss because this particular Atelier game is engaging and adorable.As you can see, the graphics are top-notch. The music isn't bad but certainly isn't on the level of something like Child of Light or the more recent Nier: Automata. The crafting system is wonderfully intricate - I'm still not sure I have it 100% figured out but I recently got to being able to rebuild things and I've spent quite a while just synthesizing things. My alchemy level is significantly higher than my battle level. :)  The story and dialog are fun and internally consistent. it doesn't challenge the reader-hearer at all but it's pleasant and doesn't detract from the experience. I like the fact that you're not a troubled hero saving the world from a planet-destroying monster. Something that would make the "talking" bits better, in my opinion, would be to add a dash of Persona's social systems to the mix.The battle system is very nice, with a fair number of options. It's an ATB sort of system and combines the usual elements, but it's especially cool to see things that you've worked to build in action. If you're losing your battles, it might not be because you're underleveled, but rather because you haven't spent enough time synthesizing or rebuilding your gear.I've had no technical issues whatsoever. It runs fast and without fail on my machine, a graphics workstation built late last year. I'm using an Xbox controller and I'm glad that I am.I'm not sure of what else to write. Atelier Ryza is a bit of fresh air for me and, even if I don't check out older games in the long-running series due their quest time limits, I'll definitely pick up any subsequent games in this particular arc. If anyone has any suggestions for Atelier games or for games in general, I'd be happy to hear from you in comments.;Recommended;39.4;17/05/2020;268;3
Koei Tecmo;Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout;RPG;R$ 299,00;IntroductionHeyo. I'm reviewing this game from the perspective of someone who's never played the rest of the Atelier series. I guess the main point that brings across is that I have no comparison to how it is when looking at the series as a whole, and instead am viewing this game by itself.Art Style & GraphicsThis has anime vibes all over it, and I love it. It looks like a modern anime game. Very visually pleasing to look at.StoryThe story starts as your typical "I wanna get out and see the world" type of deal and transitions to a "I wanna save my island", and I think as cliche as that sounds, it makes for a beautiful canvas to paint the picture of the stories of the people within very well. A few of the characters have interesting backgrounds that get revealed as the game progresses, and a lot of it has depth that surprised me in a good way. Some characters break out of the traditional character norms I tend to see just a little bit. Cliches are cliche for a reason, but it's nice to spice it up with details that make the character who they are, and this game does that well. Likewise, I enjoyed how the story progressed, and I really, really, really hope that they add sequels to this particular story. I feel that Ryza has more adventures in her future, and this may be the setup to something even better.AlchemyThere's no two-ways about it: It's clear the devs spent a lot of time creating a world full of items that you can combine that all have important uses, traits and effects that will benefit you. It also has a very elaborate and detailed crafting system (Alchemy) that you'll be spending a lot of time on. Yes, you do need to use this function to stand a chance of completing this, but it's easy and honestly insanely fun to get into.I've been looking for a game that had a crafting system of this depth for a long time, and I've finally found that in Atelier Ryza.CombatI really enjoy the combat system, and I feel that any explanation I give here would undersell it. It's turn-based, but realtime at the same time. There's a variety of things you can do, like use crafted items (think heals and bombs), skills, and normal attacks. Instead of MP, they use a system where as your party attacks the monsters, you gain AP, which you can spend to use skills. I like this better than MP, as it gets you considering other options during battle and not just spamming Y to nuke everything. Instead it's like "If I do this thing, I can set it up so I can do this when this happens", etc. Strategy planning is something I can dig and I'm glad to see the variety of actions you can take gives you a variety of options for combat. I'm limited in how much in-depth I can take this review, so suffice it to say I really enjoy the combat, and I think you will too.Difficulty LevelsI haven't experienced the higher difficulties yet, but on normal difficulty, once I got a handle on making good gear with Alchemy, the enemies didn't have a satisfying challenge for me. Which makes sense, if you make broken gear you're basically turning down the difficulty for yourself. It's not a fault of the game, moreso a fault of my own curiosity. I can't say how the higher difficulties are in comparison as I have yet to play through it on them, but I look forward to the challenge.Time Spent and Replay-ValueIt took me about 50 hours to complete it my first time, and that's again coming from me having never played an Atelier game in depth. I came in blind, not knowing how the combat worked, and really focusing on having a chill time enjoying the story and theorycrafting in Alchemy to figure out what will get me over the wall I'm up against. After beating the game, I want to play it all through again from scratch on the hardest difficulty for the added challenge. There is a New Game+ feature that lets you take your equips and equipped consumable items with you, but I feel like that would detract from the challenge I'm looking for personally. Looking forward to a Charismatic difficulty run, which unlocks once you beat the game for the first time.Edit: Since my initial review I actually did go back and discovered the highest difficulty is actually Legendary, and not Charismatic. It adds 1000% HP to monsters, you're permanently cursed (-10% DEF), and the monsters have higher speed stat. It's a challenge that takes OP gear into consideration. I only made OP weapons and armor, so this run I still have OP items and accessories to consider crafting.ConclusionIs this game worthwhile? Very yes. I truly enjoy this game to my heart's content and would recommend it to anyone and everyone I know. You don't need prior knowledge of the series to get into this one, so I'd consider this a great entry point to the Atelier series. That being said, I haven't played the other Atelier games, so if you're looking at the other titles, I'd check out reviews for those, as I hear those games are essentially their own entities that have their own flavor and experiences, like you'd expect from a Final Fantasy game. I think that's a good thing, and leaves plenty of room for variety.;Recommended;85.8;19/02/2020;185;3
Koei Tecmo;Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout;RPG;R$ 299,00;Sum up+ Worlds full of life and creatures, rich in graphic details.+ Gameplay is energetic and fun, using the battle system of action points.+ Is a good entry point for those wanting to enter the Atelier series or RPGs.+ Multiple mechanics that unlock as the player progresses through the game add layers to all gameplay aspects.+ Characters are likable and essential to the story, getting involved in a chain of events and developing traits, skills, and goals.+ Synthesis and gathering are simple enough to avoid becoming annoying but also feature deep replayability. -Side quests are, for the most part, dull and pointless.-Recycle bosses and a general lack of them bring down some of the game's hype since there are few vital enemies to defeat.- The story needs consistent pacing. it is painfully slow at first and abruptly rushed near the end of the game. There is room for improvement in getting the correct length. Introduction Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout is an RPG game in the Atelier series. It involves mechanics such as crafting and gathering more heavily than other RPGs. Still, it does so in a way that rather than being a chore, it becomes an enjoyable process of discovery and progression. The story follows a clash between respecting old traditions and cultures. Rejecting all that is not a part of those in contrast to breaking one'sone's shell and innovating, looking to bring change, which is what the protagonist Ryza tries to do.  Combat The game uses the action point system, meaning a character gets a turn when their portrait reaches the gap in the speed bar. Players must progress through areas and dungeons with a party of three active characters and another three as reserves to change formations and lineups. The AP system works as follows: a character can always execute a normal attack without any points, but they need them to use skills. Points are awarded by dealing with damage, killing enemies, performing joint actions, using items, or inflicting the broken status.While the combat system can be simple initially, it keeps introducing more mechanics that make it more enjoyable. Using the right timing between the negative and aggressive stances feels rewarding, and some battles require quick reflexes to push through. Skills are satisfying, and the orders keep things interesting through multiple encounters. Boss battles are exciting thanks to game music and their design in Gameplay that becomes an adequate challenge. Regrettably, there are few bosses in the game, and some are just the same boss with different colors.There are also tactics levels, which you can spend your hard-earned AP in a battle to increase. That will sacrifice your immediate action potential but benefit you in the long run for that battle. There are five levels. the first three levels increase the number of regular attacks (therefore the gain of more AP), and skills evolve into more powerful versions. Levels four and five give more damage and the possibility of using fatal order. An ultimate devastating technique that can be used when it is not your turn. Synthesis and Gathering Synthesis and gathering is the other part of the Gameplay. At first, it could become a bothersome element. Still, in Atelier Ryza, they made it friendly to new players while keeping some of the extra layers of depth. They are easy to do. Still, finding out the best materials or synthesis of the best versions of items is a challenging process that makes you look forward to crafting something powerful or useful.To explain that layer of depth, you can synthesize something as simple as an ingot. Then as you unlock more areas and get better materials, you can craft that ingot but make it much better than the other ingot pales. You give it extra effects, quality, traits, skills, etc. You can then use that improved ingot to make better or craft powerful versions of existing weapons. The game follows that chain. you need to gather and synthesize the best ingredients if you want the best results. An alchemist is only as good as their tools.For gathering, the game uses different elements in which one can interact in areas. The player can gather various materials, from brushes to trees, rocks, crystals, fishing spots, bags, defeating monsters and more. There are also multiple tools to gather such materials as hammers, scythes, or explosives. Depending on your tool, you can get one set of materials or the other from the same elements. The game doesn't tell you exactly how to get the materials but gives hints by telling you the area in which they are and the tool to gather them.I spent a reasonable amount of time with this aspect of the game. Gear is more important than leveling in this game, as I didn't need to grind but rather craft better equipment. Creating items to use in battle is fun. I was assigning roles and having a general strategy with a lineup. It makes it feel like the choices I made outside battles were carried into them and profoundly impacted how they played out. Story The story is good, but it does have some issues. for starters, in the early parts, it has a slow start. Events move slowly, and something is artificially extended. Characters keep dealing with the same topic in different conversations, which is sluggish. Once that early part is over, the game story picks up, and it is perfect. Ryza and her friends start as dreamers on an island and become involved in events that will change their lives forever. They are incredibly likable characters and important figures in the story.Unfortunately, the latest part of the game is rushed too. one moment, you are exploring areas and discovering the truth of events. Trying to look at the bigger picture and the next moment, the game is preparing to wrap everything up. The game could have been lengthier, seeing as some aspects of the story are skipped or beelined to the end.What I like about it is how the characters have their backgrounds. Different personalities create a diverse cast, realistic motives, strengths, and weaknesses, struggles to overcome, conflicts with antagonists, and development. Each of them is working to break out of their shell and chase their dreams. That puts them at odds with other characters. Everyone on the island had always been taught to reject new ideas and follow long-established traditions and principles. This brings a clash to the protagonist's beliefs and goals: to become something more, go on an adventure, and not be afraid of change.  What Makes It Special What makes Atelier Ryza unique is that it is a good entry point for new series players and those who would like to try out a more straightforward RPG. That simplistic approach is not bad. it makes it easier to digest the experience. It stays within its welcome, bringing new mechanics and elements to add some layers and avoiding getting stale. Conclusion Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout is a solid RPG game. The story has some problems but is overall an enjoyable ride. The choices made outside encounters carry into it, making synthesis and gathering a core aspect rather than an extra or side diversion. Combat is fun, and unleashing skills or taking different turns is rewarding if done right. Worlds are full of life, and the environments are beautiful. This game is for you if you want to get into the RPG genre or the Atelier series.9/10 AMAZINGIf you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/;Recommended;22.0;5/11/2019;143;9

Koei Tecmo;Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout;RPG;R$ 299,00;Thicc Thighs Saved The Franchise Disclaimer: Before I go into this review, I'd like to point out: I am not a longtime fan of the series. Like many, people saw the game pop up in an ad and saw the thighs. To me, I saw it as a pre-order ad and liked the artstyle. I looked up a gameplay video on it and then knew what others were talking about lol, but the combat looked really neat so I gave the series a follow. Then I saw the alchemy gameplay and got REALLY confused what was going on. Seeing it was $60, I was skeptical. So I did some research on a good place to start. Then I picked up Sophie on PS4 and enjoyed it enough to try it out on here. So what the heck is Atelier? From the experience of what I played and researched, the Atelier series is an RPG series with an alchemy focus developed by Gust and published by Koei Tecmo (You probably know KT from games like Dynasty Warriors, Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive, etc.).Rather than games starting off with conflict so intense, Atelier is more focused on a "slice-of-life" RPG, where the main protagonist(s) of each game starts off their adventure and learns alchemy. Instead of just mindlessly grinding to kill a boss at the end of the dungeon to progress the story with side quests along the way, the Atelier series has a flow of three categories: Exploration, combat, and synthesis. I'll explain my opinion on that later. Atelier Ryza's Review  Pros +Great character development+The world you explore looks small but feels big and makes it fun to explore and gather materials without fast travelling constantly.+Unique twist on turn-based combat in that it's real-time as well. Seamlessly switch party members for efficiency.+Alchemy. The core mechanic of the series. Synthesis items to use in combat or gather in areas. No two items will be the same.*(Example: I want to make a bomb, but I have made one that just deals more damage than usual. I want to make a new one, but instead of just high damage, I'll keep it about average and maybe add burn DoT. My last bomb has properties that made the bomb stronger, but this one could also drop an enemy's defense.)+Great soundtrack** Cons -Not the greatest story. Very "slice-of-life", has a hard focus on what it should be about sometimes.-Stiff animations during cutscenes. Not a big developer, so not a hard loss. I see those expectations from big companies.-Japanese dub only, but only con if player prefers English only.-Bad optimization. Launcher with limited options. Also at launch, lacked kb+m but now patched.-Needs more boss fights.-Option to switch party members in battle. Just nitpicky for that one.*I kinda prefer the Mysterious' "Tetris-style" synthesis system than the skill-tree system in Ryza, but still fun to use.**I say it's good, but mostly for the series in general, which you can add previous OSTs. Ryza's battle BGM is repetitive and generic, but the rest is nice. You can listen to it on Spotify.Overall, it's a good game for a niche series. I'd definitely recommend it on a sale or an earlier entry if you're skeptical though. Just to be safe.9/10;Recommended;62.6;2/03/2020;125;30
Koei Tecmo;Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout;RPG;R$ 299,00;Spoiler Free.First and foremost the core gameplay of Atelier Ryza is centered on an extremely deep collectible/crafting system. The majority of progress made by the player requires extensive harvesting of materials which allow new items to be crafted. This primary element of gameplay demands a slight learning curve from the player, and initially can feel intimidating. But once the player becomes proficient it is an absolute joy to hunt down specific materials to create more powerful weapons or specific items needed for progression. I'd even go so far as to say that Atelier Ryza arguably has the best crafting system ever developed. One potential downside to such a deep system is the necessity to revisit the same areas to collect all of the needed items. Some players will find this rewarding and others will find it frustrating. If you're impatient with farming items or constant use of a crafting system this game is not for you. If you do enjoy these elements then Atelier Ryza almost over-delivers in how vast the crafting system can feel.The world Atelier Ryza takes place is in is sufficiently large and varied enough to maintain player interest. Don't expect super deep world building or lore. There's just enough exposition and fragments of history in the story to give the player a taste of the state of the world and your purpose in it. Early in the game the explorable areas might seem like they lack variety. However, by the midgame and into the lategame much larger and more interesting areas become available. Once new areas are unlocked they are easily accessible again via a straightforward fast travel system.Combat is fairly simple and easy to learn. A unique hybrid of turn-based and real-time strategy is implemented. Quick decision making is mandatory, as taking too much time to take action can result in poor fights. There are no random encounters - all enemies can be visibly seen on the overworld and it's left up to the player's discretion if they wish to fight or avoid them. You're limited to a party of 3 characters. As you meet new potential party members you can sub them in or out of your combat party. Characters can be built into filling specific combat roles. Each character has predetermined traits that make them better in some roles and worse in others. Here the crafting system is also very relevant as getting newer and better gear demands that the player create it themselves. The monster and boss designs are eclectic - some are extremely cool in design and ability and others are simply cheesy. Despite this wide range in design every creature feels like it belongs in the world.The story is passable. While definitely not a gem, story elements are just interesting enough to hold Atelier Ryza together over the finish line. Characters fit very cleanly into common anime tropes, and their individual motivations are mostly made immediately clear. As the story progress each character's back stories are explored to some degree, but not extraordinarily deeply either. While the story is most used as a tool to introduce the player to new explorable areas, there are some pieces of the story arc that are genuinely compelling.Graphically Atelier Ryza is quite pretty. Each area, especially the later game areas, feel unique and well designed. Locations vary wildly in mood and appearance - open plains, mystical ruins, moody dungeons, a charming city, The character models are well designed. Some animation feels a bit rough.Atelier Ryza has elements of fan service throughout the game. Blatant nudity is never featured. If these elements generally put you off from playing a game but the game itself sounds interesting, consider bracing yourself to give Atelier Ryza a try. The rest of you... Bonk - straighttohornyjail.Ultimately, Atelier Ryza is a quality crafting and collectible game with JRPG elements.;Recommended;53.2;17/03/2022;67;1
Koei Tecmo;Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout;RPG;R$ 299,00;Atelier Thicc is a fantastic little game. I have never played any of the Ateliers before, or seen the Anime (if there is one) and the game had been on my radar for a while but I was unsure as it looked like one of those games where unless you've played since the start, you won't know what the thicc is going on. Thankfully, this is not the case. Anyone can pick this up and as far as I can see, it has no references to previous titles and it is its own game. The premise to start with is pretty basic, you follow 3 friends, Thicc, Tao and Lent, all who yearn for adventure. They're all stuck on their own little island with a peaceful village but have the taste for adventure. The game is an (intended) slow start, this may put people off but it shouldn't. There's no impending threat of doom and the gang just want to explore. The first couple of chapters is more of a long tutorial, getting you to grips with the thiccness of the thighs, alchemy, battle etc but as someone who can not stand hand holding in games, this does not do that thankfully. The tutorials themselves are fairly unintrusive. As stated, it starts off slow, the story is not bad by any stretch, but it isn't anything to wow you. It is probably intended more for the younger audience but as a fully grown adult, it is fine. The writing isn't superb but the translation is perfect and it has a professional feel to it, as though it is done by a proper developer team (which, it is. KT imo make some great games) but I state this because a lot of anime-style titles can be a bit, let's say all over the place. I want to emphasis on this fact that the story, writing is not bad at all, but it is the weakest aspect of the game. Having read some of the reviews, some are idiotic. Someone tries to claim after an hour of play that Ryza is basically fan service with two giant tumours on her chest. Just no. This is not one of those games and has no fan service and is suitable for any audience, in fact, the reviews came off as jealous and childish. Aesthetically this is a really beautiful game. Graphically it isn't impressive though. Playing at 1440p there is aliasing but it is minor. Some textures are pretty low resolution, and there are few graphical options, but none of this matters because it is still an incredibly gorgeous looking game. Zones are small (though very numerous!) and there's no loading time between them. There is a day night cycle, with rain for weather. Animations are good and believable. The UI is fantastic, crisp, clean and attractive. Sound wise it's all good, voice acting is amazing as you'd expect from a Japanese title (have not listened to English) and sound effects are decent enough. The music is...there. It is polished and professional, and clearly studio quality and it's very typical of JRPG's, although it is not something I would listen to out side of the game. This is purely a personal choice though, there is nothing wrong with it. Gameplay is addictive! Before I bought the game, I checked it's length and I saw around 25-30 hours to beat. For me, this is a little on the low side for a J-RPG but it's very obvious this is if you're PURELY going through the main story ignoring everything else. I'm 14 hours in and to be honest, I've only just finished the second chapter "taking your first steps" because I've enjoyed playing with the alchemy, doing the side quests (which are short, non voiced and not needed but good rewards) and grinding in combat. This handles the flow extremely well. What I often hate, or despise about Japanese titles is their insane amount of talking about nothing, forcing you through long cut scenes and making it impossible to quit the game if you need to go out. Thankfully, this does not do that and handles it PERFECTLY. While there are a lot of cutscenes, they are very short, and it gives you a choice to do whatever you want between them. For example, if you need to go somewhere, make something etc, you'll get a short cutscene but it tells you that you can go make the item then explore, or practice alchemy etc or you can just wait a day (rest in bed) and progress. Now, that sounds fairly typical of a lot of games I guess, though it's hard to explain. In short, you're not pushed to do anything, you're not sucked into long cutscenes that take forever to finish and the need to talk to 1274 people before you can save. Now for the alchemy. At the start, it's pretty basic but it does open up and has a lot of depth to it. The way you apply stats or quality, abilities etc is fantastic, and highly addictive. I didn't think I would like this aspect of the game, but I love it. Combat is simple to start with, but again, opens up a bit later. Optimisation is something I can't help you with. For me I am getting 100 FPS @ 1440p with the game maxed out. This feels very low to me, since I am running a Strix 1080 TI OC 12GB, 8700k and 16GB 3200MHZ. As stated, it's aesthetically beautiful, but with it's graphics I'd expect it to cap my 165hz display. I'd expect any mid range PC could run this at 1080p/60 easily though, but I would be sceptical of budget PC's. Overall, it's a fantastic game. Albeit expensive. I did not buy the digital deluxe version and honestly, I don't think you need it. The game does not throw it's RMT's in your face, so once you've started the game you won't see there's extra DLC, basically, I mean it feels like a full package. The deluxe version only gives costumes I believe anyway, except for some MINOR items that aren't needed. In closing, Atelier Thiccness is a fantastic title to start for any age.;Recommended;82.8;26/07/2020;196;44

Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;So, after this game got some patches and new features were added I thought it would be the right time to revise my review. I started and tested this game every time they released a patch. After over 120 hours and completing every achievement in this game here is what I think after all the patches and new features. Notice I played every Dynasty Warriors game from 2 to 9 as well as the extreme legends and empires variants.Technical:Performance:The game still has huge performance issues. It depends on the version of the game. 1.13 was okay while the newer versions have big frame drops again. I have a pretty good pc and still get these drops.Graphics: It looks better then DW8 but not much. Don´t get fooled by the screenshots in the store they are polished, the game doesn´t look like that in any way. Now to the game itself:Story:It´s the usual storyline the Three Kingdoms. You can play Wei, Wu, Shu, Jin and some other characters storylines like Lu Bu, Yuan Shao or Zhou Ci. Each character has their own storyline while you are going to play the same levels repeatedly. The storyline is divided into 13 chapters which play the same for every character who participates in them.Gameplay: The open world doesn´t add anything good to the game. Every battle is extremely stretched out forcing you to run all over the map and fight officers standing around in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes they wait inside a castle, but walls are no barrier for you. You can use your grappling hook to climb over the walls. The game will give you missions and completing them lowers the level of the final battle of the chapter. Unfortunately, the battles are so spread out that the missions start to feel like they are just random. Fighting system:The new combat system differs a lot from the one they had before. You have 4 new attack moves. Stun, air, ground and special. You can chain these attack moves together with your normal charge and light attacks. Unfortunately, you have less combination options than in the previous games. This makes the fighting system boring and repetitive after a short time.Difficulty:This game is way too easy I play it on ultimate without any real challenge. There are some reasons for that. First the soldiers just stand around doing nothing but being in the game to fill your musou gauge. Second the officers at least try do attack you occasionally, but their AI is not good as well. Third The enemies have a fixed level. The don´t raise their strength together with the player. Fourth the combo system lets you perform infinite combos. The enemies just can´t defeat you because they can´t touch you. Fifth you will get over leveled by doing the story missions. Being level 50 of 100 after chapter 2…Quality:Unfortunately, the game also has a very bad quality in general. They went for a new voice acting studio. Now every iconic speaker from the games before has been removed and replaced with the worst they could find. There are also many typing errors in names and sometimes even errors in the sense of their dialogue. Example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Cxp6uBDfsThe cutscenes are all like this.Now to the usual Koei laziness:- The weapon models of the tier 3 and 4 weapons are copy pasted from DW8- The musou and special attack animations as well as some minor attack animations are copy pasted from DW8 and 7- Some assets are copy pasted from DW8 and 7- Soldiers are copy pasted from DW8- The DLC weapons are copy pasted from DW8- Many castles are copy pasted around the map. You will have to attack the same fortress model repeatedly- The map is empty half the map is just planes with some dust and grassEvery character has one or two clones except Lu Bu but his attack animations are one of the worst in the gameFull Clone list:Sword -- Cao Cao, Sun Quan, Xu ShuPike -- Lu Meng, YueyingClub -- Xu Zhu, Huang GaiGuan Dao -- Guan Yu, Yu Jin, Li DianTwin Fans -- Xiaoqiao, DaqiaoSpear -- Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao (Alone these three being clones...)Poleaxe -- Lu Su, Xin XiangyingDouble Voulge -- Jiang Wei, Wei Yan, Cheng PuGreat Sword -- Xiahou Ba, Guan PingChain and Sickle -- Gan Ning, Chen Gong, Jia XuChain Whip -- Diaochan, Zhenji, Cai WenjiAxe -- Zhurong, Dian Wei, Han DangTwin Axes -- Zhang Liao, Ma DaiShaman Rod -- Pang Tong, Zhang Jiao, Zuo CiFan -- Zhuge Liang, Sima Yi, Zhuge DanShooting Spears -- Guo Huai, Man Chong, Jia ChongSword and Shield -- Xingcai, Li LingquDao -- Zhou Tai, Sima ZhaoNunchaku -- Ling Tong, Guan SuoGreataxe -- Deng Ai, Xu HuangFlail -- Dong Zhuo, Cao RenRapier -- Yuan Shao, Sima Shi, Liu ShanMace -- Pang De, Guan YinpingMeteor Hammer -- Xu Sheng, Zhang BaoGauntlets -- Meng Huo, Ding FengUrumi -- Xun You, Zhang Chunhua, Fa ZhengChakrams -- Sun Shangxiang, Wang YiFan Sword -- Zhong Hui, Cao Xiu, Guan XingTwin Rods -- Taichi Ci, Yue Jin, Xiahou YuanGuillotine Sword -- Sun Ce, Zhou Cang, Wen YangThrowing Knives -- Zhang He, Wang Yuanji, Xun YuBo Staff -- Zhou Yu, Guo Jia, Zhu RanPodao -- Sun Jian, Xiahou Dun, Huang Zhong (Sorry Huang Zhong no bow for you...)Twin Swords -- Liu Bei, Cao Pi, Lu XunMandarin Duck Hooks -- Lianshi, Bao SanniangHalberd -- Lu BuIn DW8 every character had a unique weapon. I don´t even know why they just didn´t copy pasted all weapons... oh yeah right you can sell them as DLC later.Bugs, patches and features:So they released some patches now which added some new features and fixed some bugs. What did these patches do?They always say these patches fixed some bugs but every time I started the game after an update and tested the new patch and the bugs they claimed they fixed it basically took me only 5 minutes to reproduce the bugs. Ranging from broken controls over enemies not spawning, buggy collisions and missions not finishing.The new features:Koei gives you a free trial version of the game now. With one of the latest patches they added offline and online coop. I tested it with a friend who downloaded the trial version. Both see the other player not running around smoothly but rather like we were halting all the time. It´s like only seeing him every third frame. Then we went into the fighting. The soldiers aren´t synchronized for both players. For him it looked like I was hitting the air while I was fighting hundreds of enemies. Then we were fighting Lu Bu together at Hu Lao gate and besides him teleporting around something else felt off. I dealt pretty good damage to him and said he´s nearly down while my friend said at his screen Lu Bu was nearly full health. We weren´t fighting the same enemy here. He fought his Lu Bu and I fought mine. Depending on who kills his Lu Bu faster the other would just die instantly. We didn´t defeat Lu Bu together I killed mine and the game killed his in response.The nice things and conclusion:What is nice about this game then. Basically, after all this time playing this game there is just nothing positive I can say about it besides there is a free trial version now, so you can decide on not buying this game. Did this game get better by now? No, the frame rate is worse than on release. The same bugs still exist, the AI is still bad, not responding and boring to play against. The game is still way too easy. The leveling system is still badly balanced. The battles are still boring and spread out. The voice acting is still bad. The new combo system is still bad, boring and repetitive. For me it feels like Koei tries to extinguish a wildfire with bucket of water. This is just not enough to rescue this game. To make this game good you would have to completely rework it. Some patches and bugfixes won´t do it and the price of 69,99€ doesn´t help this game to get a better review from the community.Steam doesn´t provide enough space to write about every single aspect of the game.

Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;I saw that a trial version was available for free, so I thought "What the heck, it can't be as bad as everyone is making it out to be. What have I got to lose?" The answer? My time.I loaded up the game and watched the intro movie. Awesome, right? Same style of over the top, Zhao Yun-focused intro we're all used to. I actually smiled. I actually thought that this might not be so bad....but then I started playing the game. Story mode to be specific. Where do I begin?The graphics - Acceptable from afar. Terrible up close. A long-time gripe from DW critics. It's usually not that much of an issue for me, but really guys....with all settings on the highest, this game shouldn't look like something you might have played back in 2005. Okay, maybe that's over exaggerating. Let me rephrase. On the surface, just generally glancing around, this game looks fine, but if you actually stop to look at something, it looks bad.The voice acting - When I heard people saying things like "The English voice acting is so bad." I thought to myself "Ahhh that's just the old DW style! The "so bad it's good" voice acting! But as my chosen hero, Guan Yu, uttered his first line of dialogue, I almost recoiled in horror. I would have liked to think that, as passionate developers who love their franchise (as they SURELY must be), they would put at least a little effort into employing voice actors that closely resembled those of past games. This was not the case. Zhang Fei opened his mouth, and as he did so, my jaw dropped. "Are they even trying?", I thought. Some time later I heard Zhang Jiao say something. I don't recall what it was, but I do remember VIVIDLY  my thoughts after hearing it. "They're not even trying." The voice acting in this game truly is horrendous. I think back to my first foray into the DW world, at DW3. The voice acting back then, at face (or ear?) value, was bad, sure. But Sun Tsu be damned if it wasn't PASSIONATE (and hilarious)! DW9 hasn't a modicum of that passion. It feels like they just said "Eh, they'll do.", to the first people who showed up for the roles.Animation - In cutscenes, it's partly alright and partly WTF. When a peasant comes running up to your group of heroes and you all turn to them in unison like you've got poles shoved up your backside and someone behind the scenes is rotating you all into position....that's one of those WTF moments. Sadly it seemed to be pretty freqent. Other times your characters face might be smiling, and then instantly turn into a frown. Did someone just stop time for everyone but that one character, and tell them that they hated their mother and then set time back in action, leaving us, the viewers, wondering what just happened? Who knows. All I know is, that kinda split-second emotional change ain't normal.Tutorial menus - I decided it was high time to just get down to what DW does best. Hackin' and slashin' some enemies. But wait, a tutorial. And another tutorial. And another. And another......AND an-STOP! I should not have to go through 50 damn tutorials just to go into battle! I get it....they're trying their hand at being an RPG, and with that, comes new mechanics that need to be explained. But let me just say, it's not right for DW. I just want to kill bad guys, not spend 20 minutes reading page after page of tutorial info. Keep it simple. The older games in the series just let you get into battle without too much of a fuss. This game throws 8 different menus at you, each with 5 tutorials on how to use them because they're so convoluted. Like I said, keep it simple!After finally going through all of those darn tutorials, I was free to enter my first battle.....after about 5 minutes on horse back. People have said, in regards to this game's open world-ness, that it's very empty and with little to do. I absolutely agree. So I turned on the auto-pathing thing they have, thinking at least if it was boring, I could make the game do it for me. Wrong. Smacking into trees was an acceptable annoyance, as it didn't really slow you down. But running into a barracade and being unable to move is not acceptable at all, especially given how much it happend in my short time of playing.So I finally get into combat, and the combat itself is very different. Not bad different, but I find myself thinking of that saying "If it's not broken, don't fix it." They wanted to try something new, but as with the majority of this game, I personally don't think that it was the right choice.At this point, I was genuinely upset, because I found myself thinking that I can't wait to stop playing. After about 17 years of playing DW games, from 2-8 (I did skip 6) never had I found myself feeling that way. I LOVE DW. It has been a constant game over the years of my life, and I thoroughly enjoyed them, but not DW9. I felt that it lacked passion. I felt it was not polished. I felt that it was not the DW I grew up loving.If the devs come away with anything from this game, I hope that they have learned that this experiment was a failed one, and that their tried and true methods in the games of old are what really works for this series. DW is not meant to be an RPG. That's my opinion anyway. As an avid fan of Dynasty Warriors, I cannot reccomend this game.;Not Recommended;0.8;2/11/2018;361;42
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;Technical:Performance:The game still has huge performance issues. It depends on the version of the game. 1.13 was okay while the newer versions have big frame drops again. I have a pretty good pc and still get these drops.Graphics:It looks better then DW8 but not much. Don´t get fooled by the screenshots in the store they are polished, the game doesn´t look like that in any way.Now to the game itself:Story:It´s the usual storyline the Three Kingdoms. You can play Wei, Wu, Shu, Jin and some other characters storylines like Lu Bu, Yuan Shao or Zhou Ci. Each character has their own storyline while you are going to play the same levels repeatedly. The storyline is divided into 13 chapters which play the same for every character who participates in them.Gameplay:The open world doesn´t add anything good to the game. Every battle is extremely stretched out forcing you to run all over the map and fight officers standing around in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes they wait inside a castle, but walls are no barrier for you. You can use your grappling hook to climb over the walls. The game will give you missions and completing them lowers the level of the final battle of the chapter. Unfortunately, the battles are so spread out that the missions start to feel like they are just random.Fighting system:The new combat system differs a lot from the one they had before. You have 4 new attack moves. Stun, air, ground and special. You can chain these attack moves together with your normal charge and light attacks. Unfortunately, you have less combination options than in the previous games. This makes the fighting system boring and repetitive after a short time.Difficulty:This game is way too easy I play it on ultimate without any real challenge. There are some reasons for that. First the soldiers just stand around doing nothing but being in the game to fill your musou gauge. Second the officers at least try do attack you occasionally, but their AI is not good as well. Third The enemies have a fixed level. The don´t raise their strength together with the player. Fourth the combo system lets you perform infinite combos. The enemies just can´t defeat you because they can´t touch you. Fifth you will get over leveled by doing the story missions. Being level 50 of 100 after chapter 2…Quality:Unfortunately, the game also has a very bad quality in general. They went for a new voice acting studio. Now every iconic speaker from the games before has been removed and replaced with the worst they could find. There are also many typing errors in names and sometimes even errors in the sense of their dialogue.Example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2Cxp6uBDfsThe cutscenes are all like this.Now to the usual Koei laziness:- The weapon models of the tier 3 and 4 weapons are copy pasted from DW8- The musou and special attack animations as well as some minor attack animations are copy pasted from DW8 and 7- Some assets are copy pasted from DW8 and 7- Soldiers are copy pasted from DW8- The DLC weapons are copy pasted from DW8- Many castles are copy pasted around the map. You will have to attack the same fortress model repeatedly- The map is empty half the map is just planes with some dust and grassEvery character has one or two clones except Lu Bu but his attack animations are one of the worst in the gameFull Clone list:Sword -- Cao Cao, Sun Quan, Xu ShuPike -- Lu Meng, YueyingClub -- Xu Zhu, Huang GaiGuan Dao -- Guan Yu, Yu Jin, Li DianTwin Fans -- Xiaoqiao, DaqiaoSpear -- Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao (Alone these three being clones...)Poleaxe -- Lu Su, Xin XiangyingDouble Voulge -- Jiang Wei, Wei Yan, Cheng PuGreat Sword -- Xiahou Ba, Guan PingChain and Sickle -- Gan Ning, Chen Gong, Jia XuChain Whip -- Diaochan, Zhenji, Cai WenjiAxe -- Zhurong, Dian Wei, Han DangTwin Axes -- Zhang Liao, Ma DaiShaman Rod -- Pang Tong, Zhang Jiao, Zuo CiFan -- Zhuge Liang, Sima Yi, Zhuge DanShooting Spears -- Guo Huai, Man Chong, Jia ChongSword and Shield -- Xingcai, Li LingquDao -- Zhou Tai, Sima ZhaoNunchaku -- Ling Tong, Guan SuoGreataxe -- Deng Ai, Xu HuangFlail -- Dong Zhuo, Cao RenRapier -- Yuan Shao, Sima Shi, Liu ShanMace -- Pang De, Guan YinpingMeteor Hammer -- Xu Sheng, Zhang BaoGauntlets -- Meng Huo, Ding FengUrumi -- Xun You, Zhang Chunhua, Fa ZhengChakrams -- Sun Shangxiang, Wang YiFan Sword -- Zhong Hui, Cao Xiu, Guan XingTwin Rods -- Taichi Ci, Yue Jin, Xiahou YuanGuillotine Sword -- Sun Ce, Zhou Cang, Wen YangThrowing Knives -- Zhang He, Wang Yuanji, Xun YuBo Staff -- Zhou Yu, Guo Jia, Zhu RanPodao -- Sun Jian, Xiahou Dun, Huang Zhong (Sorry Huang Zhong no bow for you...)Twin Swords -- Liu Bei, Cao Pi, Lu XunMandarin Duck Hooks -- Lianshi, Bao SanniangHalberd -- Lu BuIn DW8 every character had a unique weapon. I don´t even know why they just didn´t copy pasted all weapons... oh yeah right you can sell them as DLC later.Bugs, patches and features:So they released some patches now which added some new features and fixed some bugs. What did these patches do?They always say these patches fixed some bugs but every time I started the game after an update and tested the new patch and the bugs they claimed they fixed it basically took me only 5 minutes to reproduce the bugs. Ranging from broken controls over enemies not spawning, buggy collisions and missions not finishing.The new features:Koei gives you a free trial version of the game now.With one of the latest patches they added offline and online coop. I tested it with a friend who downloaded the trial version. Both see the other player not running around smoothly but rather like we were halting all the time. It´s like only seeing him every third frame. Then we went into the fighting. The soldiers aren´t synchronized for both players. For him it looked like I was hitting the air while I was fighting hundreds of enemies. Then we were fighting Lu Bu together at Hu Lao gate and besides him teleporting around something else felt off. I dealt pretty good damage to him and said he´s nearly down while my friend said at his screen Lu Bu was nearly full health. We weren´t fighting the same enemy here. He fought his Lu Bu and I fought mine. Depending on who kills his Lu Bu faster the other would just die instantly. We didn´t defeat Lu Bu together I killed mine and the game killed his in response.The nice things and conclusion:What is nice about this game then. Basically, after all this time playing this game there is just nothing positive I can say about it besides there is a free trial version now, so you can decide on not buying this game.Did this game get better by now? No, the frame rate is worse than on release. The same bugs still exist, the AI is still bad, not responding and boring to play against. The game is still way too easy. The leveling system is still badly balanced. The battles are still boring and spread out. The voice acting is still bad. The new combo system is still bad, boring and repetitive.For me it feels like Koei tries to extinguish a wildfire with bucket of water. This is just not enough to rescue this game. To make this game good you would have to completely rework it. Some patches and bugfixes won´t do it and the price of 69,99€ doesn´t help this game to get a better review from the community.Steam doesn´t provide enough space to write about every single aspect of the game. If you have more questions, feel free to leave a comment I will respond asap.;Not Recommended;601.7;24/12/2021;196;7
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;Tl.Dr at bottomAs of right now I would not recommend this game as a whole, as it is average if not painfully mediocre. This is coming from a fan who has enjoyed every single Dynasty Warriors game since Dynasty Warriors 3. This game aspires to be an interesting one, and by all means achieves it with SOME success, but some of the many components of which it is made up drag it down in an otherwise different game. I'll make this review simple and lay it down in simple pros and cons that long term fans and newcomers can understand. Forgive me if some things are rather specific, but everything I mention is worth considering. Pros:-The music is great-Graphics are above average-The interface does its job exceptionally-Large diversity of characters to play as, but requires you to unlock them as you play the game-Combat is mostly simple but has many components what can be used to enhance it, such as items, environment, and more-Crafting in the game is balanced enough, offering some specialization to suit your tastes, to a degree-Small distractions such as owning a house offer some distractions you can use to interact with other characters if you want-Different factors can decide battles, though it has varying resultsCons:-99% of the battles are so boring, easily cheesed. Win a battle designed to be 10+ minutes by ignoring the purely optional objectives and running straight to the commander and beating it in 1 minute.-AI who follow you around more often than not sit and watch-Even during important battles, the AI will be too stupid to properly navigate, preventing them from joining in like they're obviously meant to do-Traveling the world is essentially a big chore until many hours later into the game-Some enemies will just straight up despawn in front of you, forever gone-Some of the text you need to read flies by during a second, screwing you over if you needed to read them-Game has issues with rendering, even in cutscenes some things will just not fully render, such as characters in the front of the action.-The voice acting is something that is more of a distraction than it is a treat to listen to, as almost all voices you will hear in the game are less than desirable to listen to, and you'll hear them often enough, which detracts from enjoying the downtime between combat as well as what are supposed to be meaningful scenes. -The lip synch in this game is just god awful, with the only passable parts being special cutscenes. This comes a distasteful annoyance, like the voice acting. -Some of the game's animations come off as being slower than they should be, which is distracting-Game has inherent performance issues during combat-Dialogue audio cuts out during combat a lot -Enemies clip through objects more than often enough, putting them in places they shouldn't be, and becomes painful during battles in castlesOverall, I'd say 100% pass on this game UNTIL they patch some of the problems later down in the road (especially the AI and other oversights). As it stands, I'm being rather fair when I say this game will be worth buying, but only after they fix some of the problems with the game and fine-tune some things. It's not a great game, but it isn't trash, either.Tl:DrI personally cannot recommend this game, but you do you. I'm just here to inform I feel it is painfully mediocre at best, and that is being somewhat kind.;Not Recommended;69.8;13/02/2018;707;25
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;It's bad, but it isn't as bad as people make it out to be.One of the reason I never touched this game until now is because of the bad reviews, awful presentation, bad changes to the combat systems, and the terrible English voice acting. Bought the game on sale, and.... Most of them were right. Most.The world looks bland, like something out of a Unity Terrain Tool project. Cities also looks the same everywhere I go.The RPG system kinda works, but you spend the entire early game grinding for experience before you get overpowered real fast. The gem system is kinda okay, tho.There are too many characters, and you can only focus on one, since characters' levels don't scale as you progress through the story unlike previous installments, and the lack of incentive to replay the game from the beginning(since the game returns to be character-focused Musou Mode instead of kingdom-based as in 7 and 8). Characters lose their unique weapons, and can only select generic weapons.The new combat system, although works surprisingly well despite my initial disapproval, is kinda broken. You can stunlock Lu Bu and kill him with a finisher when his health goes low enough. And this is how you beat all officers, every single time. Just stunlock them and finish them when the prompt appears.Horse pathfinding is atrociously bad. Just don't use "Auto-Run", whatever you do.Photo mode is pure atrocity to navigate, and doesn't serve much purpose with the bland world, it feels like an afterthought. The voice acting.... well. You can google it yourself.Now with the negatives out of the way, let's talk about some of the positive things that people don't want you to see, and has kept me from shelving this game too early(as you can see from my playtime).The writing actually improves by a lot, getting over the small details of ROTK that were missed in the previous installments. I only found out from this game now that Xu Shu's reason for switching sides is because Cao Cao held his family hostage, something that is not explained at all in DW8 (I don't read the source material, so I wouldn't know). If only they animate the cutscenes like in the previous games, maybe I would get the feels, because some cutscenes, like Sun Jian's burial, looks dumb when not animated properly. The new characters actually have interesting designs, and the new designs for existing characters are very nostalgic and refreshing at the same time. It's like they want to emulate the aesthetics of Dynasty Warriors 4, but with more modern design.Music has always been one of the best part of Dynasty Warriors series, and this game is no exception. Although it's a bit inferior compared to 8, I was never bored with its music. The battle themes especially are rocking it.The new movement system is also more fluid and fun. Combat roll from DW6 is back, which is good. Stealth sections are broken tho. Mission structure has been changed drastically, to my liking. Now, instead of slogging through 20 minutes of scripted objectives, you have the option to ignore it completely, at the cost of facing a higher level opponent. You can do side missions to reduce the main mission's difficulty level, so you are still incentivized to do some stuff before facing the big bad of the chapter. However, I personally think this mechanic is really unpolished (as with the rest of the game). Lu Bu, for example, turns from a level 40 menace to a puny level 10 if you managed complete all sidequests.Some of these problems(emphasis on some) have been patched(including the stunlock mechanic, but now Lu Bu can just super-armor through anything, which is good and bad at the same time), but this is the problem with this game. From the dozens of cracks in this game, I can safely assume that this game is actually very not finished, like "didn't-pass-the-alpha" not finished. The upper managements clearly wanted them to release this game at February, which is Dynasty Warriors' 21st anniversary. As such, this game came out extremely broken. Perhaps they thought that they can patch this game later. This is an exact repeat of the Sonic 06 situation.I honestly have so much fun with this game, but I cannot overlook its fatal flaws that will turn away even the most hardcore of the fans. I can only hope that, with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires, it can be one of gaming's greatest redemption. As a Dynasty Warriors fan, I'm eagerly waiting for this expansion.4/10. A redeemable disaster.;Not Recommended;47.5;5/01/2021;112;4
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;Despite all the harsh negative reviews, I do enjoy this game, but I just can't recommend it.The Warriors series of games (Dynasty, Samuari, Orochi, Hyrule, One Piece, etc), at their core, are just mindless hack & slash button mashing against hundreds of enemies.  Just repetitive slaughtering all day every day. If you prefer having some sort of thought into what you are doing, you will never like any of these types of games. Personally, as much as I like thinking games, I find some mindless killing every now and then is good for the soul, especially after a long/bad day.The only differences between the games are the franchise themes (Chinese history, Japanese history, Zelda, Gundam, etc) and the extra gimmicks used for the individual games to try to make them stand out from the rest (giant boss enemies, character switching, weapon switching, bonus card tactics, etc), which can all change in between each game of the same series, let alone the different franchises. In this case, the main selling point of entry is the open world gameplay, as opposed to individual mission maps.Rather than Pro/Con, I'll simply list out what I find to stand out on this verses others in the series.1. Visuals on here are rather boring to look at. Fairly drab where other titles have been much more colorful.2. This series of games always have bad dialogue, but not only is this one bad, but it's boring and wants to put you to sleep. No real emotion or energy in it.3. Lots of weapons and items to craft and purchase, but after a bit, you realize most are all the same and there's actually only a few that are unique, they just each have multiple bonus tiers that make it look like a lot. At this point, you realize that the number of actual Unique weapons/items, is actually less than previous games.4. Huge cast of characters, which is normal for a Dynasty game, but this has more than some previous titles. You can equip any weapon to any character though, so this results in no real uniqueness between them except their appearance and their special Musou attack. Plus, with all the characters, given that this is Koei, you would think there would be more costume options available to unlock or even as DLC, such as versions from the previous games (this is the 9th gen after all), but no. There are only a few and they aren't very good. And mods only replace existing, none add any (to my knowledge).5. The new combat system introduces additional moves/control options for fighting, but the actual combat feels much more basic than before because the original combo fighting is no longer there and there's little need to use the new options.6. Difficulty seems to have dropped in this one. While you could always just charge straight for the enemy general in previous titles, it could still prove to be difficult without at least clearing some of the riffraff beforehand. Especially when you can now just grapple over a castle wall and bypass the bulk of enemies entirely.7. As with some more recent titles, enemies just spawn in place out of no where instead of charging out from a gateway zone. With the new open world aspect, this really takes away from the immersion into the game. Especially if you think you're making progress in clearing an army only for them all to re-appear in the same spot you just killed them all in a minute later, instead of reinforcements charging in from a barracks off to the side or something.Lastly and more importantly...8. A whole new open world concept where there are no more mission maps. Everything is connected. Traveling on foot or horse to each new location, trying to discover hidden spots, conquering the individual little guard posts and enjoying the views. There is Fast Travel available between locations if you need and don't want to run across to the opposite side of the world, but that kills the immersion of charging into the battle. While I think a lot of people dislike the idea, I personally enjoy it. Or I did, until I realized it is not persistent and this is where it really kills me. There are 13 story chapters in the game. With each chapter comes its own presets of who controls what. Meaning, the entire world map gets reset with each chapter. All those hundreds of guard posts and forts you captured to make life easier for your troops over the last couple hours? Now back under enemy hands. Every. Single. One. Even the ones off in the far corner that have no bearing on the current story chapter that should suddenly make them an enemy to you. I get that there is a time difference between each chapter to show the progress of time and change, but it kills the immersion and incentive to fight to capture any of the posts at all. Instead, just fast travel to the required fight scenario, kill the general and repeat. Which brings me to this. what is the point of an open world map if it is just going to be ignored? This is the main draw of this entry to the series and it is completely meaningless. Much the same as all the random bandit and animal groups all standing around on the map when you're traveling between locations. There are better ways it could have been handled, such as switching over the required forts and then just giving them reinforcement boosts for troops charging out to capture the guard posts.  Of everything else that I've mentioned in this review, this is honestly what ruins the game for me.;Not Recommended;75.8;31/07/2021;121;3
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;******NOTE:  As with all Koei Tecmo games, I refuse to touch this game with mouse and keyboard. Therefore, this review is only relevant for people who have a gamepad.******Edit:  I don't know what Koei did, but I'm getting stupid amounts of lag now (25 fps on a good day).I'm going to have to give this game a negative review, but surprisingly not because of the new combat system. I actually like the new mechanics - they feel quite fluid, if unpolished (more on that later).Dynasty Warriors 9 feels like a step forward and two steps back. The open world was an interesting idea, the hunting, fishing, and hideaway systems are fun diversions, and the overhauled combat is pretty good. But unfortunately, everything good also feels like it could have used just a little more time to iron out the wrinkles.First and foremost, the combat. Gone is the usual "Combo X number of normal attacks into Y power attack that always does Z" system that they've used since the beginning (ignoring DW6, of course). Instead, all combat buttons are contextual. It's actually not too difficult to learn, but the targeting is atrocious. I've lost count of the number of times my character lunges past my intended target in order to counter an enemy attack fifty meters away when all I wanted to do was perform a guard break.******The BIGGEST issue I have with the game is a simple one:  all of the battles and chapters feel exactly the same. "Go here, kill this officer, and move on." Remember when Hu Lao Gate was a huge ordeal, and facing off against Lü Bu was a challenge? Not so any more! Thanks to level scaling, I absolutely stomped Lü Bu at Hu Lao Gate with a Level 5 Sun Shangxiang on Free Play. The same thing goes for every other battle. Gone are the roaring flames of Chi Bi as the Coalition Forces hold off Cao Cao's massive navy. Want to kill Zhang Jiao? Just scale the city walls with your Grappling Hook and kick his teeth in before your allies even breach the city gates! Seriously, each battle is an epic waste of potential.And what even is the point of Wall Jumping outside of being generally useless and wasting stamina? The vast majority of the time, I'd rather just perform a double jump or use the Grappling Hook (which takes the challenge out of sieges anyway).Holy crap is the AI useless. Allies and enemies no longer actively push fronts thanks to the side quest system. Instead, they clash at a specific point, get bogged down, and stay there for the entire battle unless you happen to go kill the enemy officer. Then they move up to the next side quest and stop. At least in Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires, your allies could capture bases and be useful for something other than fodder.Then, you have the hunting and fishing systems, which feed into crafting. Hunting is pretty basic. Just pull out some Poison Arrows and go ham on the trigger. Stealth is pretty broken - you can put 5 or 6 arrows into a Bear before it even reacts. If it reacts at all. Fishing is pretty barebones, but every time you successfully reel in your line (it's almost impossible to fail from my experience), your leisurely fishing trip is interrupted by raucous cheering that goes on for several seconds. Frankly, it's a bit obnoxious.Speaking of crafting, the RPG elements of this game are actually pretty nice. You get a basic stat system (Health, Musou, Stamina, Attack, Defense, Speed, and Archery) where you can invest stat points as you level up, giving you the ability to fine tune your characters, shoring up weaknesses (e.g. boosting Sun Jian's attack to keep pace with his defense) or min/maxing (giving Xiahou Dun nothing but attack boosts). The stat system is further enhanced by equippable items that give various bonuses. Familiar items like Tengjia Armor return, but there are several new additions as well. On top of even THAT, each weapon has 6 enhancement slots that improve various traits and grant your special attack elemental abilities (Fire, Ice, Thunder, Wind, Slash, Poison). The character customization is probably my favorite part of the game (by virtue of everything else being entirely broken).All in all, the game lacks depth and polish. IF they improve on the system, I can genuinely see Dynasty Warriors 10 being my favorite open world game of all time, but if they don't, well, it'll be trash. Complete and utter trash.;Not Recommended;152.1;22/06/2019;166;6
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;I have a lot of good and bad things to say about this game, so please do what you will with this review.The reason why I rated it negative is because someone who isn't a fan of the Dynasty Warriors franchise will NOT like this game, if you are a lifelong fan of the series, then it could go both ways for you.If you never played a Musou/Koei game in your life, don't buy this game. Seriously, don't. If you have, consider what I am about to say.CAMPAIGNThis game claims to have individual campaigns but that's incredibly false, each kingdom is separated into chapters and only specific characters can play certain chapters. For example, Cao Cao will play from Weis chapter 1-8, while Pang Tong is only playable from Shu's chapter 6-7. So if you finish Cao Cao's campaign and you want to pick another character (lets say you pick Xiahou Yuan) then you WILL be starting from chapter 1 again and playing the EXACT same campaign. Each character does have there own ending cutscene but if you want those so badly just look them up on youtube, they're actually quite good. Long story short, the campaign is a long story mode, no chapter is unique to certain characters, they're all the same.Characters/Mechanics.The combat was revamped, I can't really say it was for the better... it's different, and I can respect that. So you basically have a knockdown, stun, knockup and a special. Every single character has this, the difference is significant enough but it's a step down, some characters can do some cool stuff (Xun Yu you can jump after using your knock up and hit them with more throwing knives, Zhu Rans down can be used to poke enemies) so on and so forth, Character cloning isn't a big deal, trust me you won't be playing every character, which goes on into the next segment.Replayability.None, zero. Pick your characters wisely, because I guarantee that you won't be playing the same campaign twice, playing as Sima Shi in chapter 11 is the same as playing Zhong Hui in that same chapter. I advise you to pick different characters while jumping from the campaigns, pick characters who die early into the campaign so you can have an experience with a bit more variety. So don't play through Sun Quans full campaign, because you would have already experienced the story, and you wouldn't want to play through Wu again.Story.The story is actually really well narrated, and I believe that this is the best thing about the game. I don't want to say much since I experienced the story nine times but just know that this is the best of the nine in terms of narration. One more issue.No free mode, my favorite character is Pang Tong, and he dies two chapters after he is introduced, in a normal dynasty warriors game I could just select him in free mode and enjoy playing him in whatever era I want. But because there is no free mode I would be stuck playing in the battle of chibi if I wanted to max level him, yeah, not doing that. And it's a shame because his moveset is incredibly cool. This isn't the only character I have an issue with, Sima Shi and Zhong hui gets no playtime either. If your favorite character is a short lived one, tough luck."You just need to complete one character's story to play free mode, but it's only unlocked for the chapters+faction that you have already played ie completing Cao Cao's story won't unlock free mode for Shu's or Wu's chapters."So free mode turns out to be POSSIBLE but only under specific circumstances, personally I won't be going back to play the same chapters, dynasty warriors 8 just has a better mission structure. So...The game is fundamentally bad, you really have to be a fan of this series to somewhat appreciate the attempt at an "open world" game.;Not Recommended;76.9;9/05/2018;129;4
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;The best way I can describe this game: Fun, but not fun.I can spend hours playing Dynasty Warriors. I can literally spend a day off blazing through a Wu or Wei campaign and not grow tired of it. I can boot up an Empires title and spend a day forging my own path across China. I find it a lot of fun, and can put a lot of hours behind it. I can't do that with DW9.It's fun for about an hour, but I find it to be less fun the longer you play, which should be the opposite of a DW title. I don't have an issue with the revamped moveset (although mass clones, and de-cloning through DLC is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), but the combat itself is pretty fun. If your PC can handle it, the scale of some of the pitched battles is pretty fun. Assaulting Hu Lao Gate at dawn is amazing. But again, the longer you play, the less fun it becomes. Since there are no individual stages, you are stuck roaming a massive but relatively empty map of China, with no urgency at all. You can literally ♥♥♥♥ off for 10 hours killing tigers in the southwest part of China while all your allies sit camped outside a "mission stage" waiting for you to trigger the battle. There is no urgency and no risk of failure outside of you dying to fire arrow spam from archer towers. But you push through and complete a character's story. Then you learn that in most cases, you have to play the exact same setup with a different character. For example, I started with my favorite, Sun Jian. His campaign is two stages, the Yellow Turbans and Hu Lao Gate. Once I finished his campaign, if I wanted to play the rest of Wu (this was before the mass unlock feature) I had to play as Sun Ce, starting at Hu Lao Gate (which I literally just cleared) to progress the Wu story. Then his story ends at Chapter 4. The next batch of Wu characters don't let you pick up at Ch 5, but instead you have to replay chapter 3 or 4 with the new unlocks. Rinse and repeat. Jump over to Wei or Shu? Play through Yellow Turban Rebellion (which is no different across all factions, just a different starting location). So yeah, the more you play, the more of the same you encounter, and the less fun it becomes. I can't play for more than about an hour or so per session without getting bored. Overall, I'd say it's a great concept with innovative ideas, and I'd enjoy it a whole lot more if the execution didn't completely ♥♥♥♥ the bed. There's a lot more issues with the game and the changes they've made as well. But I would not recommend unless you see it go on one of the 75%-80% sales. $60? No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way? 15-20? Sure.;Not Recommended;50.2;25/02/2019;110;3
Koei Tecmo;Dynasty Warriors 9;Action;R$ 224,00;I've played every Dynasty Warriors game since the second. There have been some mistakes - namely, reduced enemy density in DW4 damaged what made the series special while replacing weapons and reducing the character count in DW6 was not good for me.Through all that, this is the first game in the series that I just don't like.Not only is it not any good in general, but I can't come up with any redeeming qualities to soften the blow. I'm not one for  hyperbole, I just can't think of any single thing in this game that is better than other games in the series.I hoped that the DLC would help, but, in its own way, it showed the same poor workmanship and laziness of the base game. Each of the DLC characters reuse a weapon and pose from other characters. To be fair, the DLC characters execute different moves, but if you played DW8, you'll immediately recognize the poses - Dong Zhuo's daughter has Gan Ning's old weapon and pose, for example.Anyway, I've written good reviews for games that just made me so happy that they deserve the praise. I've written bad reviews, mainly for games that made me angry for one reason or another. This is the first review I've written because a game just makes me sad. Nearly every minute of my play time was spent wishing I was playing DW8.In short: Dynasty Warriors 9 is like finding your old friend from school - the one who was always nuts and made everyone smile - and discovering that he has become addicted to meth and suffered crippling brain damage from sniffing glue.;Not Recommended;49.5;14/07/2018;110;23

Koei Tecmo;Dead or Alive 6;Action;R$ 299,00;This game went with basically everything that is wrong within the gaming industry at the moment:- bare bone base game- designed only to sell DLC- low effort reusing of old assets Even though probably no one will ever read this I'll go into detail on what I think is wrong and why the latest part of a series, that I've been playing since DoA 2, does not deserve to be picked up by you just yet.1. Why do I call this game bare bone and accuse it of reusing of content?Because it is essentially the same game we've had with 5 LR minus all the stuff that had been released over the long livespan of the fifth part of the series. Yes, you do get newly designed stages and improved graphics. But that's about it. The movesets are still mostly the same (here and there they might have changed a move but you will instantly feel at home with your main character). Game modes are still the same, they just added a quest mode ontop of everything. Costumes are very sparse in this one. You get one new design, the classic attire (and you can see they just slapped it on and improved the textures a little for stuff like fabric BUT it still looks of lower graphic quality than the new design), and one or two (depends on character) more outfits plus several recolors of each costume.2. Why is this game a DLC trap or aimed at getting you to buy stuff?Well, as I said there is not much in it at the moment. Even on release one character is already hidden behind a paywall as deluxe exclusive. Then, ontop of a 75€ deluxe edition they also want you to purchase a 90€ season pass. I know what you think it's crazy for that thing to be more expensive than a deluxe edition there has to be some INSANE value in it, right? NOPE! Two future characters and a bunch of costumes but more like two sets so 26 characters get two new costumes. That's it.Feeling sick yet? It gets even better. Somewhere hidden in the details to the season pass you can read (and most people will probably not read it) that they are planning to release more DLC during the time the season pass runs that is not included there. I mean... yeah. Congratulations you just bought a subscription to our content for one season, that cost more than the game, but you're not even getting everything we gonna release. 3. I mean okay that's a bit shady but I can still enjoy the game with my base costumes right?Well... I am terribly sorry to tell you but you can't. You first have to unlock all but two costumes. And they come in costume fragments, for which you have to do quests. YES, DO QUESTS IN A FIGHTING GAME TO UNLOCK RANDOM FRAGMENTS! We heard people in the mobile market enjoyed that kind of thing. What is even worse is how the damage system of the characters is the ♥♥♥♥ same for every single character: No matter how often you perform the meter special onto them (ya they only get bruised by that one single attack it's weird I know) they always get one cut on the cheek, one bleeding mouth corner and depending on the costume the mid section rips off and there is a cut on the stomache. That's the fakest attempt to market something as realistic character damage ever. It's just one attack changing the mode of your character period. They didn't even bother to make it different for each costume or each character, incredibly lazy!4. But Jan, you play this game and you played all the other DoAs before and put up with Koei for over twenty years. Is there nothing that DoA 6 has going for it?Oh, there is. Like I said the graphics are way better. Not only did they add some shaders and improved the lighting and coloring (remember the pale colors of DoA 5 that required you to use reshade to get them saturated?), the stages are also competely redesigned and got super fun interactables. A major improvement was to bring the background from low res into high resolution meshes. I also feel like the movement and controls have been improved quite a bit. It has become easier to dash from walls, do midair combos with Kasumi or time your holds. And the slow channeling special attack has been replaced by a meter driven one button system for an easy to execute strong move.5. So who should buy this game?Diehard DoA fans who don't want to miss a part. People who never played any other DoA and want to enter the series. Everyone else should just skip for now and wait until they release a new edition of DoA 6 with bundled content.There, now I've wasted my time writing a review for Steam where no one is able to read more than two sentences in a row. But if for some reason you made it down here and are reading this now I salute you and award you the title "the chosen one". I sincerely hope this review helped you evaluate wether to buy this game or not. It might sound super cynical and angry, but it actually isn't. The game really is how I described it.

Koei Tecmo;Dead or Alive 6;Action;R$ 299,00;GameplayDead Or Alive 6 has the best gameplay in a 3D fighting game. Game is fast, very technical, complex and deep.NetcodeNot so bad, much better than Arc System Works games and SFV, but very far from Code Mystic games Netcode.Game Modes Unfinished story mode. Even if was finished, is the worst of the series, lacking, confusing, and with no development for the characters.Team Fight (TAG) isn’t implemented.Versus, arcade, time attack and survival are more or less the same as DOA 5 LR.Best training mode at a fighting game, with free frame data, lots of modes, options and combos.Issues We waited barely one year for a decent ground game, fatal stuns update, and a lot of bug fixes. We still have lots of issues, like autographic bug for online, that despite that was partially fixed for AMD users, is not totally fixed for everyone. This bug made people play at lower resolution and graphics at online mode for barely one year. Game lighting and shadow is poorly optimized despite the awesome graphics. some character poses look more edgy than DOA 5 LR.Some hairstyles has alpha blending issues on PC that are not present on other versions of the game (Like PS4, Xbox One)Stages have a lot of bugs, like the smoke at road rage or texture blinking issues.And many more that I don't have the time and energy to write....StagesDead or Alive 6 is the game with fewer stages of the series. One of the hallmarks of the series where their spectacular stages. Sadly, we got just a few, not so well designed stages compared with the old ones.We got a free stage this year, Seaside Eden, but compared with DOA 5 LR version, new one is smaller, with only one level.Is the game of the franchise with worse and fewer stages, and community manager stated that there are no new stages planned for now. 15 stages versus 26 from the last game.CommunicationThe community manager only showed twice in a year, and no precisely to ask for feedback, so....Greed They raised the prices again. The VV character will cost the same as SNK characters (more expensive than Rachel and Momiji)Looks like their intentions is monetize the game as much as possible. With other words, they cared very little about improve the game for one year. And when looks that they start to care with the ground game changes, fatal stuns and such, you notice that this is just an illusion. Not all versions of the game are equal, now ps4 users have the chance to change hair colors... for a price. More greed and another issue that we believed were forgotten. Platform exclusives.For the past few months we got a few free legacy costumes. Sadly, now are discontinued and we have to pay for them (Like Zack's alien costume)Before we got SP with new costumes, and revivals pack with old costumes ported from DOA 5.Now they include old ones like the Gust mashup at SP.UPDATE 25/02/2020 The PS4 "feature" to change hair color costs 1 ticket per hair color change. This is the most predatory thing I never saw, even looking at web browsers gacha games.Customer SupportThey use their templates, they are slow to answer, and they show a lack of interest that is alarming. Is rare get a decent answer.HackersPeople like CoreValueKing, and few others spend the time cheating on ranked matches. Despite Koei/Tecmo knows about them, they do nothing about it. Thanks God this game do not have many cheaters, just a few, but still shows the lack of interest from the developers about the fighting part of the game.PatchesGame has frequent patches and updates. This is so good, even if sometimes are just to add non mandatory extra costumes.Patch notes are useless. They cover it with "etc". Looks like they are afraid to tell what they did. They are always late, with an alarming lack of detail. We need to test intensively everything to have an idea about what they touched, because they never cover bug fixing details.Patches are always late and they don’t listen the feedback from users. (If you are part of the "inner circle", or wait for one year, maybe they will)CensorshipGame was not censored at launch, despite what many people say. In one year only one costume was censored. Game has all his sex appeal and fan service. At least for now.UPDATE 25/02/2020 Phase 4 Arnice costume transformation was not available on DOA 5 LR PC because of the engine version used (It was on console versions), so they added two costumes, the base and the transformed one at PC.Now, the demon version, was not even added. Lazyness or censorship? Due the similarities with the only censored costume, (Rachel's Fiend costume) and being one of the most revealing ones, I would say censorship. Up to you to analyze it and take your own conclussionsCostumesLooks like with each SP we get fewer costumes for more money. SP 4 is specially disappointing.Despite they tried new things with costumes (like ninja costumes) those are very lazy on design.SP costumes do not have many models, usually 4 for all fighters. Costumes with special properties on DOA 5 LR, like Phase 4 Arnice costume transformation, lost those properties at DOA 6. Same with Hot Summer costume pack. None of those costumes transforms now.CommunityOne of the bests, if not the best FGC on Steam. Game is full of helpful people.DesignFor the last year I got the impression that game was designed to sell costumes, not to be the best fighting game. They could do much more and much better.Conclusion Don’t support Koei/Tecmo laziness and policy. Don’t support their greed. Get the free version, stick with the character you want to main, and buy the costumes you like for that character. You do not need to spend more to enjoy this game. They do not deserve it.Despite all those faults, actually, for me is the best 3D fighting game on Steam.;Not Recommended;311.0;24/02/2020;188;11

Koei Tecmo;Dead or Alive 6;Action;R$ 299,00;I WISH I could recommend this game, as Dead or Alive is one of (if not, it IS) my favourite fighting game ever.It's just that Koei Tecmo is so insistent on having their hands deep in our pockets.I love the game, there's so much to love about the gameplay and the mechanics, but everything surrounding it is so wrong. I don't even need to say anything about the gameplay, because I DO love it. The mechanics of DOA's hold system always stood out to me. The game feels amazing to play, possibly the best in the series, although I do miss Critical Burst. It sucks that this has to come inside such a mixed bag.The game is horribly expensive. There's characters missing that we have to pay to get back in the game. Unlocking costumes is ACTUAL torture. There's STILL no custom online lobbies even though that was the main criticism of the last game. Tag Team was removed, which was one of my favourite modes and one of the reasons I got into DOA. Story hasn't gotten any better. DOA Quest is blatantly a mobile-game quality experience meant to waste your time.Sometimes I even think, they spent time developing DOA Quest, but not Tag Battle. It makes me so upset.These aren't bugs, glitches, or accidents. These are all conscious decisions made by the developers knowingly.They even didn't bring back Momiji (at launch), a character owned by the people who make the game, and yet there was a tweet stating that Momiji MIGHT make it back into the game IF DOA6 does well. There's literally no reason that this should be the case. Even when she did make it back into the game, she isn't even free despite being 1st party and in the game before.It's ludicrous, because I love DOA, but the developers are garbage.It doesn't help either that the DOA community at large seems more concerned with censorship, as opposed to the actual functionality and intention in design. Tons of people who play this game will buy anything, even if they know it's wrong. I got mine for cheap, thankfully.;Not Recommended;35.1;5/03/2019;342;8
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Middle-earth: Shadow of War;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 229,99;When I first died in this game I was killed by a savage grunt called Krosh the Chop. He killed me in an outpost when i was fighting 4 captains at the same time. So he became a captain. I was mad so I decided to hunt him down but when I went to his nemesis mission he absolutely destroyed me because fighting savages in this game gives you cancer. With all that rage I decided to go after him for the final time. I interrogated a worm and learned that.. Krosh will instantly die to fire. I always fought him next to hundreds of grog barrels but never decided to shoot one. So I find Krosh and lure him to a grog barrel and shoot it. He burns to death. When I was going to Shelob's cave in Cirith Ungol a familiar orc screamed "ranger!" It was Krosh again. He had cheated death but he was different this time. Instead of being called Krosh the Chop he was now called Krosh the Flame of War. He was wielding burning axes, his face was burnt and he was immune to fire this time. Sadly for him I had just learned how to kill savages so I used my new skills on him. He was not a strong target.After 30 In-Game hours I get a quest about killing a necromancer. When I arrived in Minas Mithil to kill the necromancer I see a familiar Orc between all those level 50 orcs i slayed recently. An orc that I used to mourn. A level 8 orc to be exact. Instead of attacking the necromancer i decide to see who this guy is. Turns out he is the one and only, Krosh the Flame of War. But this time instead of killing him I decide to recruit him. I hit him twice and he breaks. I recruit him and he joins my ranks as a level 14 captain. I train him and send him to fight pits for him to level up. Surprisingly he is very good at slaying anyone thats twice his level. I force him to murder all other captains in my ranks even the ones that sent me gifts. It was all going well until he came across Az-Agur War Master. A level 62 Olog. It was a very close battle but sadly Az Agur crushed Krosh under his giant mace. I kill Az Agur as soon as Krosh fell. I attempt to revive Krosh but I fail.. In the loving memory of Krosh the Flame of War aka Krosh the Chop. May he rest in flame.;Recommended;55.9;16/09/2022;1,572;387

Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Middle-earth: Shadow of War;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 229,99;This game is perfect to me, here's why: After I had gotten the ability to recruit enemy captains, I saw there was an achievement to shame an Assassin Captain until they become deranged. I attempted this with one called Dûsh. The second time I saw him, his title was rebranded to "Dûsh the Shamed" and he told me how terrible his life was now and how all the other Orcs were laughing at him, after which I fought him and shamed him again. The next time I saw him he became "Dûsh the Unshamed" and told me how he reveled in the title and embraced it and Orcs respected him more, he became even more powerful than he was at first, and I got a sense of comradery and respect for Dûsh. I chose to shame him again. The next time I saw Dûsh the achievement I desired popped up, except this time Dûsh wasn't speaking anymore, he was just making noises that sounded like a cartoon airplane stalling in the air (which made me laugh everytime I heard them, though now I realize they may have been his way of expressing his suffering). This is when I recruited him to be one of my captains. After some short time, he betrayed me. I had it coming. I deserved it. I thought I'd be able to recruit him again, except this time he had Iron Will, which meant he was unrecruitable and couldn't be friendly ever again. It was either I shame him again, or him and I fight to the death. Not being able to repeat the same mistake I made already, I thought to myself "So this is it, old friend" and fought him. I won. Defeating him gave me a very powerful legendary although the price was far from worth it. I just wanted Dûsh back. All of this isn't part of the game's story, it's unscripted, it's made up from randomly generated logic-branches of code that is nearly guaranteed to be impossible to get for anyone else, let alone my other playthroughs. The story Dûsh and I shared is special, it's our story. I'm sorry it had to come to this, Dûsh. Forgive me, old friend;Recommended;57.8;29/04/2021;626;203

The full story is about 5 pages long and occured over roughly 4 hours of gameplay, so I'm opting for list format here. Note: A 'Death Threat' draws an orc out of hiding and increases their loot, but levels them up considerably. 'Shaming' lowers their level and makes them easier to recruit/convert to your side. Okay here we go...1) I recruited an orc assassin named Zugor the Kingslayer2) I also recruited an olog-hai tank named Az-Adar the Pit Fighter3) They became blood brothers (super-duper orc best friends)4) Az-Adar became my favorite fighter                ...fast forward to good part...5) I decide to do an ambush mission for orc xp.6) The ambush grows out of control (at this point it's me, 3 friendly captains, 3 enemy captains, plus armies)7) Az-Adar shows up (Yay, help!)8) Az-Adar betrays me (F**k)9) Zugor teams up with Az-Adar (Double f**k)10) I kill Az-Adar, Zugor is now royally ticked off.11) I defeat and shame Zugor, Zugor flees (battle ends)12) I send Zugor a death threat13) Zugor is now Zugor the Unashamed (Legendary stats + a new culty look)14) Zugor kills me16) I send Zugor another death threat17) I defeat and shame Zugor (He flees)18) I track down and ambush Zugor (with the intent to convert him back)19) Az-Adar (no longer dead and a legendary badass as well) shows up mid-battle as an undead abomination (Zugor's culty new outfit apparently granted him Dr. Frankenstein powers).20) I kill Zugor21) Zombie Az-Adar is now super ticked off and gains crazy health and damage22) Epic 'Big Boss Battle' fight scene ensues23) I defeat and shame Zombie Az-Adar24) Zombie Az-Adar flees, but loses “Iron-Will” (I can mind control him again)25) I ambush Zombie Az-Adar a final time26) I recruit Zombie Az-Adar with mind control27) I use Zombie Az-Adar to take over the entire region and kill everything28) I promote Zombie Az-Adar to OverlordTL.DR: Two randomly generated orc NPCs made a better story than the entire campaign.;Recommended;49.6;1/12/2017;510;353
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Middle-earth: Shadow of War;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 229,99;Middle-earth: Shadow of War is one of my favorite games of all time for one massive, outstanding reason.The Nemesis SystemTo this date, I have yet to encounter anything as dynamic, fun, unpredictable, and exciting in a story driven combat game as the Nemesis System.  I have over 300 hours in Shadow of War, and out of that 200 hours were spent after I had completed the main campaign and 2 DLCs, completing every collectible and questline.  200 hours after the game was essentially "completed".The experience of how your character interacts with the uruk enemies and how the enemies interact with you and each other is simply spectacular.  An example out of dozens I could give:  I return to Nurnen after several tours of duty in the other provinces, holding off numerous sieges and having to replenish and restructure my army's ranks.  Upon my return, I face an all out insurrection in my ranks.  Three of my captains and a warchief all decide to betray me in a coordinated ambush to start a full-on UPRISING against me.  In the process, they bring one of my still loyal captains out and kill him in front of me.  In total, I've just lost 5 captains in an instant and gained 4 new enemies.  The next 2-3 hours were spent systematically hunting down every one of these traitors and punishing them in different ways.One I outright killed in the first battle.  He got off easy.  One I forcibly re-recruited and demoted.  The other 2 I shamed into absolute despair.  One's mind broke and I killed him, only for him to cheat death and return for more punishment.  The last one I forcibly recruited so I could execute him by making his head explode.  Through all this, I put the fear of Mordor through the rest of my ranks, and there has yet to be another uprising like that since.The orcs (uruks and ologs) remember everything that happens to them.  They remember if you threw them off a cliff or burned them.  They remember up to a point how many times they've killed you or how many times you've had to run from them.  They even call each other by name and have rivalries and alliances within their own ranks.  Sometimes a warchief will step down from his high place to defend one of his favorite bodyguards.  Sometimes an assassin will track you from one province to another and ambush you when you least expect it.And the best part?  None of this was scripted.  All of this happened after the main campaign was long, long over.  The Nemesis System rewards the creative and adventurous player with amazing encounter after another.If you're a fan of Lord of the Rings fighting and stealth games.If you like exciting and interesting AI enemies with personality and unpredictable behaviors.If you're a sick bastard who enjoys killing, torturing, and mind controlling the evil.Look no further.

Upon respawning, I decided to track him down and re-arrange his face with my sword. Our brief encounter ended with him being thrown off a ledge and falling to his death, I thought nothing of it at the time.Little did I know I would encounter that same orc time after time again, the dude just wouldn't stay dead. Regardless of the injuries he sustained, he would always be back. I recognised this orc's admirable endurance for punishment, so naturally I decided to dominate him. He served as my bodyguard for many hours, and we went on countless conquests together. We attacked and defended forts, cut down enemy captains whilst adding others to my army. This orc began as a grunt, and has risen through the ranks, becoming a captain, an epic captain, and finally a legendary warchief. His bloodlust seemed endless, and unfortunately that was the case.Recently I was wandering around Gorgoroth and tracking down an enemy captain. The fight was brutal but eventually his head was separated from his body, and his supporters fled. I was low on health and learned a valuable lesson moments after as my favourite orc decided to betray me.Perhaps it was my fault, I'd aided this orc in all his encounters and made sure he was victorious. I assigned him as a warchief, helped him become legendary, and inadvertently deluded him into thinking he could take on the Bright Lord.His followers were slaughtered, and I regretfully executed the masterpiece I had created. Or did I? Perhaps he survived his fatal injuries like all the other times. If so, I look forward to introducing him to my Drake.;Recommended;121.6;26/03/2020;369;140
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Middle-earth: Shadow of War;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 229,99;Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. It starts out a little boring, since the only thing to do aside from the main story is killing orcs, but once you reach Act II, the game really picks up, since it allows you to have many interactions with the same orc captains, and form relationships with them.The combat is fluid and fun enough to keep the typical person entertained through Act I, but it's not really what the core of the game is. The core of the game is the Nemesis System. Basically what the Nemesis System does is that when an enemy kills you, they get more powerful, but more than that, they remember that they killed you. Not to mention that your enemies can occasionally cheat death if you kill them, and they'll remember that you killed them, so they'll come back with a figurative axe to grind and a literal axe in their head. I feel like the best aspects of the Nemesis System could best be demonstrated through stories.One of my late-game nemeses was Zoruk Runnybowels. Yes, his name referenced his diarrhea, trust me, he was more intimidating than he sounds. He was the bane of my existence throughout Gorgoroth, but eventually I got together a team of 3 of captains that worked for me, and sent them all to murder Zoruk dead. We succeeded! Then he cheated death almost immediately, and went right back to kicking my ass, except now it was personal for him.He killed me, and that's when I discovered that he had killed me so many times he got promoted to Warchief. I could draw him out in a warchief mission, but instead I continued building my army. I eventually had an army whom's strength I trusted, and we went to capture the fortress. This was where I finally put an end to Zoruk Runnybowels. We captured the first of 4 victory points, guarded by Zoruk, and he began running to protect the next point. I would not allow this.I shadow-strike pulled him back to me, and we participated in a 1v1 battle. I actually even killed some of the grunts who came to help me, because I felt that would be unfair to Zoruk, and I wanted him to know he lost. In a video game. I felt like I had something to prove to an NPC.Since we'd already captured the victory point, no grunts came to help Zoruk either, and I managed to bring him down to zero health. He fell on his knee, and I was prepared for the coming QTE to land the finishing blow, when he started giving a speech. I don't recall exactly what he said here, but I'm just gonna say he quoted Thanos and said "You should have gone for the head." He got back up, revealing he had the Death Defying trait, and by now he had adapted to most of my different types of attacks, so he kicked my ass.I tried a second attempt to capture the fortress, and things went similarly at first. We captured the victory point, I got a 1v1 duel with Zoruk, but instead of bringing him down to zero health, once he was broken I grabbed him. Since we were in Gorgoroth, there was a river of lava running right down the streets of the fortress, so I tossed Zoruk into the lava.I went on to capture the fortress, and finally breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Zoruk was finally gone... Until he cheated death again, coming back as Zoruk the Flame of War. But that's a story for another day.;Recommended;144.0;21/12/2019;252;98
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Middle-earth: Shadow of War;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 229,99;Is Shadow of War worth buying in 2021?Short Answer: YES!!https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238331578https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232829285https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2265216731Shadow of War is one of the most enjoyable game I have ever played Even after all these years I still go back to play it again once in a while. This game doesn't end when the story is over. It's absolutely worth getting, especially on sale. The online portion is still played by many. It’s not pvp though so don't expect that. The Online conquest is a sort of pve game mode but the forts which you can attack are set up by actual people, so you'll never really find the same setup all the time. You can send your overlord on an online pit fight or you fight against other people’s fortresses that they've stocked with, usually, their best orcs. Online vendetta is similar but is more like missions where you are going after an orc from other players’ game who has killed them. You can also defeat and recruit orcs from other players forts. The same way, if any of your precious orc unfortunately dies in any of these online conquests you will lose them for good.The Nemesis System and combat gameplay are what keep me coming back The combat is similar to the likes of Assassins Creed and the Batman Arkham games but much better in my opinion. The abilities, combos etc are really fluid and satisfying. It’s not just hack and slash, you have to use your brain before going after different types of orcs. Higher tier Orcs will have multiple immunities, rages and strengths along with certain weaknesses. You can have to exploit them in your advantage, by tracking down a Worm. For example, there are orcs who are immune to arrows, executions, fire etc. Fortress captains tend to have more strengths than weaknesses, so you have to be careful with that. You have to plan your ambush/attack and prepare before joining a fight.Thanks to the unique, intricate & superbly designed content generator named ‘Nemesis system’ I never got bored at finding interesting AI orcs with personality, unpredictable behaviour and catchy, comedic/provocative dialogues. Not to mention certain death defying orcs who just would not stay dead. No matter how much punishment they go through they still sometimes resurrect and ambush. You might think that the best thing to do here is dominate and recruit them but they can still betray you later!! The Nemesis System also rewards creative and adventurous players with new story lines and breath-taking encounters one after another. The system even turns some orcs into truly memorable enemies.FurthermoreThe game’s visuals and landscapes are sublime. The story can easily rival the masterpiece that is The Lord of the Rings trilogy. This story driven game also has some intriguing plot twists that is worth mentioning.The in game unlockable gear sets including rings, bows, swords, armors, cloaks, daggers, hammers, masks are quite remarkable. I didn’t have to grind very hard to get them. While playing the game I became addicted to fighting Orcs, hunting them down, confronting those that betrayed me or killed my Captains. After levelling up and acquiring new sets of skills/abilities I felt a sense of unique and divine Godly power….it’s hard to describe with words. I also formed a bond with Talion not just to avenge the slaughtering of his whole family but through his morals and belief in a better world – a better Mordor.DLCThere are two DLC available which are slightly different as you play different characters (Eltariel & Baranor) in them. You get Nemesis expansions: a number of new Tribes, new orcs, tribal weapons, legendary gear sets, new fortress & regions and obviously new missions. They tie this game’s story nicely with the earlier story of Shadow of Mordor. Any gripes?Although certain aspects of the game like brutal killing, torturing, and mind controlling the evil can be fun for many people but might be little too much for certain faint hearted ones 😂ConclusionIn my honest opinion, even if you are not a big fan of Lord of the Rings or not much familiar with it, it’s a pretty safe bet you'll get your money’s worth in Shadow of War definitive edition.;Recommended;363.5;18/01/2021;377;5

Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Batman: Arkham Knight;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;This is the best Batman Arkham Game everUPDATE: ok so, you want me to really give a reason why. This is my opinionThis game is bigger most of the thing whether it be the story, map, feature, mission and of course detail. For me, I like a game with detail and ester egg. With the big game like this, but the price is so low. Only story is worth the money already. Speaking of sequel, let's compare them a little bit. This game was back to be developed by Rocksteady, same studio with Arkham Asylum and Arkham City which is one of the best Batman game. The game first has a lot of problem but now it's in a good condition now. Not only that it has all feature from the previous game, it also have new feature. One of the best thing that I like in this game is Batmobile. It's not just a car, it's a tank+car which is so fun to play with. There're also a lot of challenges too which act like a mini game for you to use you Gatget or skill that you have in the game. The thing that I really hate in this game is The Riddler. You have to collect all his trophy to end the game 100% and this game have them like 10 time more than The Arkham City one. Also, the thug in the game talk so much which is annoying sometimes. This Arkham game is also the last Arkham game of Rocksteady too. So, it's the closure both for the developer and the Batman Arkham series. And this is all my thought about the game. You might don't like what I like. It's your decision. That's all I wanna say.About performence:I use i3-2100/GTX960/RAM12GB (lower than this is unplayable because the fps would be so low)-My setting is about low-medium-the fps is around 40-60. fps drop sometimes but not lower than 30.-fps mostly drop in Batmobile race mode rather than Batmobile battle mode and combat.-While driving through the city really fast I will experience a microfreeze. Not so much but quite often sometime.;Recommended;114.8;15/06/2017;1,088;27

Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2;Action;R$ 89,99;Well, if you're a fan of the LEGO series of games in general, you'll probably be wondering whether this game lives up to the standard set by the original LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game. The original is considered by many to be amongst the best, if not 'the' best LEGO game to date. So, does it live up to the original? In short, the answer is no.I find my own opinion very divided on this game, so will try to summarise the Pros (+) and Cons (-)+ Original plot-line is well written and keeps you interested throughout+ Graphics are the best of any LEGO game yet+ Excellent range of characters & vehicles available (the lack of X-Men / Fantastic 4 doesn't bother me)+ Good range of character skills you'll use as you make your way through the story+ World map free roam area is large and varied+ Level design is mostly good, with each level being unique, i.e no two levels will feel 'samey'- Voice acting, and i don't necessarily mean in the same way as some of the other reviewers have said. Yes it's true, some of the voice acting is weak, but some of it is also very good. Kang, Ms Marvel, and Rocket Racoon all stand out in my mind as being some of the good ones. It's not 'all' bad anyway. What i do take issue with, however is the production standard. Two characters can be having a conversation, and one voice is much louder than the other. In the current version of the game, this will happen in the very first level, and sets the tone for the rest of the game really.- Instability. Oddly enough, this wouldn't have been on the list when I first downloaded the game. When the game was first released, i clocked ~40 hours in without a single crash. Then they released a 3GB update (and didn't even release any patch notes with it). Since this update, frequent, random crashes. Very frustrating. Still, i soldiered on to 100% which leads me to my next point...- Gets stale for 100%. This game has introduced challenges in the open world. These challenges consist of 'find all the x', or 'destroy all the x' in chronopolis. The location of 'x' however, is not on the map, and with some of these you don't even get a clue as to where they may be. I appreciate that they just wanted to add more for the player to do, but these challenges seem like an unnecessary and frankly uninteresting hurdle to achieve the fabled 100%, and I did not have fun doing these.In summary, i personally didn't enjoy this game anywhere near as much as the first. If I was to give this game a score out of 10, in it's current state it's a 6/10, therefore 'just' earning a recommended review. It's still a recommended review as overall i still had enough fun from it to play for 60 hours, and it is, overall, a good game. You can tell the developers put a lot of effort in, it's just a shame that the technical issues really take the 'shine' off it.If they could just fix the 'fixable', such as crash issues and normalising the voice sound levels, then that would only leave the chronopolis challenges as my main criticism. This is minor compared to the others so would naturally lead to me increasing my score.;Recommended;64.8;12/12/2017;109;2

Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2;Action;R$ 89,99;MY RATING: 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 ✘ ✘ 8 / 10 We can be heroes for more than one day... After LEGO Marvel Super Heroes (2013) and LEGO Marvel Avengers (2016), the Marvel Heroes are back with an even bigger, more exciting and fun sequel and in this game offers a colorful toy chest with all sorts of known and unknown building block heroes as well as an epic odyssey through space and timeIf you would summarize the story briefly and succinctly, it would probably be something like:Kang the Conqueror has chosen Earth as his next target. Yes, the earth again. The Guardians of the Galaxy get in the way of Kang on an evacuation mission, and a chase through space and time begins. Kang, wanting to impress Ravonna Lexus, takes various locations from different timelines and packs them into one place to create his own city of Chronopolis and rule there.So far so good and that actually sounds like a lot of fun. And it is, if only there weren't various problems. But I'll get to that in a moment.In order to stop the conqueror, the story campaign takes us through Egypt, K'un L'un, Wakanda, Nueva York, Asgard, Hala, Lumeria, our normal Manhattan and much more in 20 missions for around 15 hours.In addition to the well-known (Avengers) heroes, the rather unknown ones are staged here and thus raised to a level with the others that the lesser-known heroes would probably not have gotten otherwise. Otherwise, She-Hulk only appears as a joke in the Simpsons.Another change compared to the previous part is that this time you can play with the Guardians of the Galaxy, i.e. Star-Lord, Drax, Rocket and of course the popular Groot, who also emphasizes his name sufficiently in every scene.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2822833731LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is packed with smaller and bigger missions, side quests and secrets. There is something to do on almost every corner in the large game world. The tasks are varied, typical of Lego and range from collection missions to races, accompanying missions to sports and skill missions. And of course, the guest appearance king Stan Lee ❤ is back, who has gotten himself into some predicament again in both the open game world and in every story level and needs to be rescued.One of the biggest strengths is that basically nothing has changed in the gameplay. Eliminate enemies, solve a little puzzle here and there and defeat bosses. As usual, the playable characters were equipped with different abilities. For example, there are switches that can only be operated with Captain America, or places that can only be reached with a character that can fly. In addition, there is a really gigantic number of playable characters. Altogether there are over 200 !, which of course you only unlock in the course of the game. And if that's not enough, you can create up to 10 of your own characters with desired skills in the character editor.Anyone who knows LEGO games knows that the games have their own atmosphere and, above all, humor. Marvel Super Heroes 2 is absolutely no exception. In many scenes, the characters simply throw out their opinion or a funny saying, which skilfully interrupts the "seriousness of the situation".https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2820634727Iron Man on a LEGO horse, Groot in Egypt or Hulk in space? No problem. The game creates countless scenarios and just throws everything wildly around, creating what is otherwise only possible in the children's room. Fantastic worlds that otherwise do not exist in this form.Unfortunately, like in one or the other LEGO game, I sometimes have such problems in the game that I don't know exactly what to do next. It's not that I don't know how to solve a puzzle. No, sometimes you just don't see what the next puzzle is. So you run around wildly with your character to find out what the game actually wants from you. Well, that usually doesn't last too long, but moments like this just slow down the otherwise „action-packed“ gameplay a bit.A definite criticism is the controls. In this game, I even felt that to be extreme. The controls often seem very fiddly and poorly thought out. Especially in moments when you have to switch to another character, there is a lot of back and forth between the characters until you have finally selected the required character. A more precise option would have been desirable. The double assignment of some keys for the many abilities are often more annoying than helpful. No, not because it doesn't work, it's more that if you press the button just a little too long, the wrong ability triggers and you have to start all over again. In addition, there is also one, sometimes even all, who stand in the way of up to five other characters.If your opponent is somewhere that is not entirely visible or is covered by something, you will be shown a player card with a picture of the character in question. Basically, that's a good idea, but it often has the disadvantage that when you have to perform an action, the card overlays the button to be pressed and you can't see which button you should press.And speaking of the other AI characters.After I had to restart several levels because one of the characters got stuck somewhere or jumped into an abyss in a continuous loop, depending on the level I didn't follow over the collapsing bridge, I now do everything tediously and manually to be on the safe side . Means, for example, if I have to use a rope with 3 characters to cross an abyss, I jump onto one character, run a little forward, switch (if it then works right away) to the next one, jump onto the rope with this one and then to the last one to get it on the rope too. The crossing then takes place in the same way and step by step. Totally tiring but still better than playing a level over and over again. Doesn't mean it has to happen to you or that it always happens. As I said, this is my “safe” variant.But the biggest problem is the camera work.Often there are objects in the way, obscuring the picture or the character is outside the picture and there is no way to move the camera accordingly.

Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Mad Max;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;Mad Max puts you in the role of the titular, iconic character from the movie franchise and  plays and feels darn close to the films. The Good: - GORGEOUS graphics - A story that makes you feel like you're in the films' world -- stupid fun that takes itself too seriously :D - Tons of things to do - exploring, fighting, racing in a variety of contexts - Car customization lets you mix and match parts to find combo that best works for youThe Meh: - Although the car combat can be bracing, the physics are not solid. Even with the heaviest upgrades the slightest spinout or collision with objects in the environment (not other vehicles) can send your car bouncing around like a ping-pong ball. - Any fleeing enemy vehicle WILL be able to outrun you -- even if it's a battered, burning wreck with a single health point left -- unless you have the best V8 engine in the game. But by that time it's not even worth pursuing them for the meager amount of scrap they produce. - Mini-bosses (Top Dogs) have different names but are the same character model using different colors. No difference in fighting styles. Beat one and you know how to beat the rest. Did the team run out of time/money to make them unique? - Some tasks are too repetitive, but if you find yourself bored you can always progress with the story.The Bad: Nothing stands out.Rating: 8/10Gorgeous to behold, exciting to play, could have been even better.;Recommended;62.7;17/06/2017;1,198;21

Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment;Mad Max;Action, Adventure;R$ 89,99;THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU BUY MAD MAX!	Mad Max is an open world game focused on driving, exploration and fighting. It's not a very story heavy experience so do not expect many main and side missions. Most of my gameplay time was spent on driving around and liberating all areas, scavenging and upgrading Strongholds, my vehicle and Max.  Environments, weather changes and day/night cycle. 		Mad Max is visually very impressive especially on the highest settings I was playing on. Each Stronghold's region looks different so it is really fun to explore those areas. Weather changes and day/night cycles made it look very atmospheric and realistic. But there is one very frustrating thing connected to it and that is that you can't always postpone to a certain time and there are two missions when you need night time. I think this is the biggest flaw of the game to be honest. It makes you feel desperate and hopeless. It makes you waste your time. A lot of it! (I'll write about one possible solution in the section about Strongholds). Game controls	Game controls feel very good, at least for a controller which was recommended to me as the best way how to play this game. I am sure that mouse and keyboard works as well. But considering that most of the gameplay time includes driving and most of the fighting encounters are based on melee combat, using a controller definitely feels more optimal here. Difficulty	There is no difficulty scaling in the game. So for a person like me the game was extremely easy and forgiving. Even boss fights are easy because all the bosses are very predictable. So if you are an experienced gamer seeking a challenge, you will have to look for it elsewhere. The only time I died in fights was in cases like this and it was rather hilarious than frustrating:   Watch "Plasma can't fight video clip"	[clips.twitch.tv]  Liberating areas belonging to Strongholds	There are 4 Strongholds in the game and if you decide to play this game you will spend most of the time liberating their territories by decreasing their threat level from 5 to 0. The usual activities are destroying scarecrows, killing snipers on towers in the regions, defusing mines on minefields, invading enemy camps and destroying convoys roaming in the territory. You can also find close to 200 scavenging locations on the whole map. It's nice that each location shows you exactly how many of each item you are able to find there. It's a very gamer friendly overview if you want to collect it all. Some of those locations have project parts in them which you can use to upgrade Strongholds which will give you some bonuses for the Stronghold's regions or everytime you enter Stronghold you get full ammo, full health and full water canteen. One of the projects in Strongholds is delivering scrap. You use scrap for upgrading Max and your vehicle but in this case you can donate it to Strongholds and by doing that you upgrade them to 100%. I thought it had no other meaning than full completion so I fully upgraded all Strongholds as soon as I had the chance and scrap required for it. But almost in the end of the game you get two missions which can only be done at night and donating scrap to Strongholds can help you get the night time easily. So please if you decide to buy and play this game, do not repeat my mistakes! Wait with donating scrap! It will save you from some very frustrating times later! Main story	Without including any spoilers I have to say that the main story is very short, dark and fitting the post-apocalyptic setting. If you are a completionist like me you will get almost no main story for many hours. I got into a very addictive grind. All I could think of was grinding more to have it all finished. Most of the main story starts once you reach the last location on the map. I enjoyed having nothing else than the main story left in the end. I could just chill and enjoy the ride! :) Racing - Death Runs	The game has racing and I really enjoyed it. It's not only about racing but also about destroying the enemy vehicles. Once you finish a race with a certain vehicle you will unlock it in your garage. If you get better than an average time you can gain a Griffa token. Griffa Tokens are used to develop Max's survivability, for example his health bar which is one of the most important upgrades. There are other ways how to gain the tokens but they are part of playing the game while these death run races are optional and can help you gain some extra tokens to speed up upgrading Max to full. Bugs and glitches	I have to say that the first two Stronghold territories were basically without problems for me. But in the third territory I started to run into all kinds of issues - UI disappearing during missions, no ability to pick up explosives which were needed to progress in the game. Even enemies started to disappear! You have to see it! I was so shocked :D --->   Watch a video clip of enemies disappearing!	[clips.twitch.tv] All of it was solved by a simple reload of the game, luckily. But it makes me think that maybe the game was a bit rushed in case of polishing in the end before its release, since they were trying to release it at the same time as the Mad Max movie was released.  Final verdict	Mad Max is definitely not for everyone. I heard from some of my friends that having so many objectives on the map at the same time was very stressful and negatively overwhelming for them so they didn't feel like playing the game anymore. At the same time if you are into that kind of open world games, you will find it extremely addictive! You will think about it a lot and you will be looking forward to playing it again. I even have some friends who felt like playing the game again after watching me playing it for a while. I don't know how it is possible that the game makes us feel like that, but it's a bit scary so for my inner peace I am quite happy that I am 100% done with the game! .);Recommended;70.0;27/09/2018;270;7

Focus Home Interactive;A Plague Tale: Innocence;Action, Adventure;R$ 239,90;A Plague Tale: Innocence (Action-Adventure)Absolutely riveting.  NOTE: This game IS about The Plague, so there will of course be rats... Many many rats.There are many options, so I will only list a few:Brightness SliderRe-mappable keyboard controls, plus two possible setups for the controller3 Save SlotsSubtitles are OFF by defaultAim AssistI HIGHLY recommend going into the Advanced HUD Settings and checking them out.  Most are OFF by default, and if it's your first time playing, you're probably going to want/need to adjust them.Story:14th Century France.  Step into one of the darkest times in history, when The Black Plague swept across Europe leaving 25 million people dead in its wake.  We play as Amicia de Rune, a high-spirited young noblewoman with a rich imagination and a longing for adventure.  A peaceful day out with her father is soon shattered by a voracious entity in the woods, and her world is then turned upside down as her home is invaded by soldiers.  Now she and her 5-year-old brother, Hugo, are on the run, and the newly-erupted sickness all around them seems to be the least of their worries...https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852326073There are historically-accurate items peppered throughout the game, but this is not a historic account by any means. What A Plague Tale gives us is a world of the arcane, filled with terror and the unexplainable.  Only once do we actually see the disease up close and personal, and this allows us some degree of detachment from the horrible reality of the suffering all around us.  There are some incredibly gruesome visuals in the game, to be sure, but I can't really give any additional details without spoilers. Cutscenes can be skipped by holding down the appropriate button (on my Xbox 360 controller it was the B button) -- useful when you die right after a long dialogue.Gameplay:There are three types of collectibles to keep an eye out for during the game.  Although I am usually a big fan of hidden content, this tale is so compelling that I didn't want to break the immersion by running around just to find the extras.  They DO expand upon the story and overall feeling of the time frame, but I chose to focus on the story for my first playthrough.  Luckily, you can easily go back to get items or achievements that you missed via the Chapter Selection button on the main menu.  Not only that, but when you use this function, it shows your collectible status for each chapter!  Nice!Early on you're mostly running, sneaking and occasionally using your slingshot.  Just when I was thinking that was all there was to the gameplay, everything changed.  Now there were puzzles, different kinds of ammo, less running and more overall finesse, adding an extra layer of depth to everything we needed to do. The game is not without its flaws.  There is no map, nor indicator of which way you should be going, and although it doesn't happen often, this can result in getting turned about and heading the wrong way.  I did find some collectibles that I'd missed when I had originally passed through, so at least there was a plus to getting lost. lol~At times we need to move around carts or large boxes, and the movement was very hard to get used to for me.  Pro tip: When moving large items, push or pull ONLY, and adjust the CAMERA to change directions!https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852898291Battles:They have armor, shields and mighty weapons to crush, impale and otherwise snuff out your life in an instant.  You have a slingshot. I'm sure that you can see a bit of an imbalance here, but there is much more to combat than it seems at first glance, and you do have the ability to dodge (not covered in the tutorial, by the way.)I mentioned earlier that you will end up with different kinds of ammo, and you'll sometimes have to switch between them quickly in order to take out your enemies.  This can be nerve-wracking, so learning what each type does before you go into battle is going to be a huge help to you.Ammo concoctions can: Light firesDouse firesCause burning pain that forces enemies to remove their helmetsKnock enemies out for a non-lethal killThese are only a few of the possibilities, but telling you more would entail spoilers.  I'm sure that you can see the possibilities here, but there's another layer to your battles, and that is stealth and wit.  Planning out your moves, distraction techniques and of course getting your enemies off by themselves are all going to be beneficial to your health. .)I believe that there is a fail-safe built into the game to make it impossible for you to be without what you need to continue, but it can't hurt to grab every single ingredient that you can get your hands on - you'll need them for your ammo, and crafting whilst running for your life is beyond stressful!Speaking of which, I'm not going to lie -- The battles start out easy, but they become brutal fights for survival later in the game.  I actually got to one battle that was so furiously difficult that I had to turn off the game for a while.  In retrospect it's because I was making things WAY harder than they needed to be by not utilizing my tools to the best of their ability, as well as something else which I didn't realize at the time, but can't mention because it's a BIG spoiler.  Going back and replaying one of the harder battles only took me two tries instead of over a dozen, so tactics can make a huge impact! Luckily, there are multiple save points in a battle, saving me from literally pulling out my hair and from having a stroke from a blood pressure spike! lol~ I have to say that Aim-assist was my best friend in this game - I don't know if I could have completed the game without it!Sights and Sounds:The music that plays whilst the game is loading is a testament of things to come. to the epic journey you are about to embark upon.  Every aspect of the game is the same quality as that intro music: beautiful and haunting and of the highest production values.  The voice acting is superb, as is every sound effect, sigh of the wind and musical note that you will hear. The visuals are absolutely stunning, completely enveloping you in this terrible but beautiful world of strife, pain and love.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1852955060I was overjoyed to learn that there is an in-game Photo Mode, which allows you to pause, move the camera around, get the very best angle and snap amazing shots to your heart's content. Extras:Codex - All collectibles that you have foundAbility to change the family Coat of Arms (if you have that DLC)Epilogue35 Steam AchievementsThe Epilogue is very short.  There are no collectibles, but it does give us just a little bit of extra closure.  Although I don't want to wish any more misfortune on our characters, this game was so amazing that I'd love to find out that a second game is in the works. ♥Verdict:A Plague Tale: Innocence has the most compelling, the most riveting story that I've ever experienced in a game.  It's not just the writing... It's also the environmental graphics, the voice overs and the gameplay, all merging into a world that feels tangible and alive!  Buy it now, play it NOW...

The quality of the graphics is at the highest level, I don’t remember a single game in my memory where they would pay so much attention to small details, working out grass, leaves, developing rags from the wind on the window.A little about the game:The game is pretty easy to learn. Variations of items that you can use with your sling, for different opponents and the ability to eliminate them differently each time, I really-really liked.Ruined fortresses, temples, villages — all this is done so believably that you quickly begin to believe in the world of A Plague Tale: Innocence. The game does not skimp on showing a mountain of soldiers killed during the war, corpses bitten to the bone and guts scattered on the walls.

Focus Home Interactive;A Plague Tale: Innocence;Action, Adventure;R$ 239,90;A mesmerizing soundtrack which sets you into the atmosphere of the game. A masterfully crafted and coherent plot with emotional moments. They say a product is as good as its weakest link but it really is a consistent game in terms of pacing and gameplay. You won't find filler quests as in many sandbox games today, you are in for a linear, tight and focused story with gameplay elements being introduced as the plot develops without them being too overwhelming and adding diversity to the gameplay. It also benefits from a phenomenal art direction.The two main characters Amicia and Hugo  as well as Beatrice are well developed, albeit I feel that the rest aren't as much and they are way too stereotypical, only serving as a means to advance the story, without any tribulations or motivations other than their cookie cutter traits. I've experienced flickering in some textures while rotating the camera fast, I don't know if it's a generalized issue or one with my hardware settings but it got quite distracting at times. I thought the game would've benefitted from a bit more realism in combat, had the sling been more unreliable as a weapon and used as a last resort, but this is nitpicking on my behalf. In my humble opinion, I consider it to be a superb game and I would therefore encourage anyone willing to give it a try.;Recommended;12.0;22/12/2019;146;3

Gameplay seems more like an afterthought in that the game isn't very challenging and the primary gameplay devices consist of stealth puzzles and very one dimensional action segments. This is the biggest detractor for this game in my opinion. -This game will take you roughly 8.5 hours to complete. That is relatively short for a singleplayer games, but, I believe the price tag accounts for this.Overall, I would definitely recommend picking this one up if you enjoy narrative driven games ie (Uncharted, Last of Us, God of War)I will eagerly await a sequel if one ever makes it to market.;Recommended;8.4;17/05/2019;392;100

Focus Home Interactive;A Plague Tale: Innocence;Action, Adventure;R$ 239,90;This is a fantastic movie-like experience in which the player takes the role of Amicia de Rune, a girl whose parents were killed and the only family left is her sick brother. On the run from the inquisition, chased by soldiers, rats and time, she's doing whatever it takes to survive.It's a typical linear game with a single path ahead, no choices, no alternate ways. The gameplay is pretty simple and besides some crafting and material collecting, it might be called a "walking simulator". That's not bad at all, I love such games. One of the main gameplay elements is stealth as Amicia is forced to stay out of sight often. Here come the bad things which  kinda ruining the experience for me - enemies are completely dumb, I'd even say brainwashed. Their vision is horrible and reactions to actions caused by Amicia just plain stupid. For example, Amicia can throw stones around them and they don't hear a thing until the stone hits their head directly. Also, they completely ignore her brother shouting "Amicia, I'm scared! across the whole field. This is the major downside of the game but besided that, I can say nothing but good things, so let's go to them.Graphics is gorgeous, some of the textures are not the best but reflections, level design and the overall look and feel is amazing. I press F12 for screenshots so often that my screenshot library is already full of beautiful sceneries.The story is definitely above the average, highly enjoyable, easy to follow and simply said - amazing.Main characters have personalities and souls, not annoying and stupid at all (inspire yourself, Wolfenstein Youngblood!), Amicia is fun to play as.The overall setting is dark, the game is brutal and includes disturbing scenes, IMO should be avoided by children. I appreciate the realistic and honest way of representation of such a dark age, it helps the immersion and atmosphere.I also recommend playing with French voices as it helps the atmosphere. I didn't understand a thing but subtitles help. Speaking of it, I appreciate the complete Czech translation.Performance is very good, optimization seems ok on a 1660 Ti (~3300 MB VRAM usage) running on Linux via Proton 5.0.6.

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;*** DISCLAIMER: This game is NOT for everybody, even though I'm loving it, A LOT. And that's because it is a little slower than most games. it revolves around a huge social mechanic that I mention below. ***My thoughts so far:Well, I'm absolutely loving the game, and apparently I didn't get to the awesome parts where the game really picks up. This new innovative mechanic they added in is just awesome, and I've never seen it done in an RPG before. The whole game is all about choices, and it has me going through many dilemmas. Drinking blood is highly desirable as it gives you a MASSIVE amount of xp, granted you can earn xp in other ways, but drinking someone's blood will give you A LOT more. Now, the interesting part about this is that as you learn more about a person (and in turn, the world you're living in, and the lore of the game) the more xp you get from someone's blood. Here's the issue: Let's say you meet a person you don't particularly like. you're like: "okay, i don't like this guy anyways, I'm going to want to kill him. Let's learn more about him so we can earn more xp when we drink his blood eventually." Simple, right? WELL, as you learn more about a person you might've disliked at first, you might end up actually liking them. It's like what happened with Dwight in The Office as he studied Andy. So it's like, "well damn it. Now I have this huge dilemma. Do i want this delicious 4000xp I can get in 2 seconds? I like the guy now." I found that particularly very interesting.And as you talk to people, you actually learn a lot about them, their relationships, their motives, and how they contribute to the district. How much of a loss would this district experience if I kill this fella? Does he matter to anyone? Also, do you want your districts to be in great shape? And if so, well, killing them reduces that district's health. so it's like DILEMMAS upon DILEMMAS. and when a game has me in that state and care that much about the people and the world I'm in, I consider it a great game. The way it presents the story is awesome.Now, obviously, you ARE going to be doing a LOT of talking, pretty much EVERY NPC has dialogue. SO, the voice acting HAS to be good. and THANKFULLY, so far, it's been nothing short of awesome. Super immersive and believable dialogue. so I'm glad.Graphics wise, it's okay compared to other games (minus the beard. the beard looks phenomenal lol.) BUT this post-victorian London looks aweosme, and the level design is somewhat soulsy, with shortcuts to open (doors being locked from one side) and small corridors. It is a small map, with not THAT many people. BUT every single person you see (that is sane) has a backstory, emotion, dialogue, and investigations and relationships for most.Music is AWESOME tbh, super vampire-like, and not "Vampires: Masquerade", that was a more punkish setting. In this one you feel like a high-class vampire, an intellectual one, while listening to an amazing string-based/orchestral score. Finally, combat: in it's basic form, it's okay. It mostly plays like the Witcher. BUT, with the coolass dodge animations and abilities you get, it truly makes you feel like a vampire, which is good to me. I have fun with the combat, it could get hard, especially in boss fights. So I'm good with that. I like the mechanics they introduced too. Different types of attacks (blood, shadow, physical, stun) with enemies having different resistances is always a good sign for an RPG.TLDR. this is an RPG. you talk to people and make very meaningful (hard-ass dilemma-inducing head-scratching "yeah I'll just sleep on it") choices.P.S. I WILL update this as I progress through the game. I know that the story has a lot to offer as well, and I haven't done a lot of that yet.EDIT: I'm almost 20 hours in, and not even halfway done, but perhaps that's just me taking my time with the game.So what I've come across that I've found most interesting are the sidequests, or "investigations." They are very indepth and allow you to make choices that affect the world around you, sometimes on a significant level, sometimes on a personal level. However, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are these choices hard. The choices aren't white or black, e.g. blow up megaton or not.No. The most recent choice I've come across seriously had me quitting the game to sleep on it. I'm seriously conflicted, and have no idea what to do. I even texted some friends as to what they would do in a situation like this. I'll give you a little insight into one of the choices I've come across, if you don't want the nature of the dilemma spoiled, then please read no further.MILD SPOILERS: *********************************OK, so I met this dude, and he was a ♥♥♥♥. part of a gang, who extorts some people in town for money, especially this merchant who used to be his best friend. I was like, okay, this guy's a ♥♥♥♥, I might as well suck on his blood later. I walk around that town and knock on a door, and an ill kid opens the door, turns out that it was that "bad guy"'s son who is kind of sick and depressed, and his father is trying to everything he can to help him, he loves him a lot, the one thing he cares about in this world. I also snooped around the house a little to find a rejection letter from the job the father was trying to apply to, so HE IS TRYING, but he has no choice since they wouldn't hire him because they know he's part of a gang. Also, his wife is dead.Here's the tricky part: while i was exploring out in the world, i found a box. And in that box was an unread note from his deceased wife to his best friend. WELL, turns out his former best friend and his deceased wife have been having an affair a long time ago, AND, WELL, that ill kid might be that dude's son instead (which I think is the case.) SO... now I have the option to either give the note to the widowed husband, or to his best friend... How do you deal with knowing that your dead wife had an affair with your best friend? That the son you're trying to do everything in your power to help might not be your son? Is he just going to go and kill the merchant? At the same time, damn, I want him to know, I hate cheaters.****************************END OF SPOILERthat had me pulling my hair out trying to decide what to do. I just ended up quitting the game and going to bed to sleep on it. That is just one example of so many morally grey choices you have to make in the game aside from sparing/taking people's lives.;Recommended;27.6;4/06/2018;699;15
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;For the most part, this game is great. Great storytelling and interesting characters, and a lot of morality-based decisions that have a real impact on how the game plays out and really forces the player to consider their actions carefully. Do you kill a confessed murderer who is the only one supporting his elderly mother, who in turn is the only one raising an orphaned teenager? There are tons of decisions like these throughout the game, and maintaining a no-kill playthrough is decidedly hard as a result.However, the game also allows you to play it without killing fairly well. In my no-kill playthrough, I didn't feel like I was at a huge disadvantage for not killing any civilians, but the game is balanced well enough that it quickly becomes clear that you would be much, much stronger if you did. It's a unique approach that makes killing a civilian with a hefty amount of XP attached to them very tempting, without feeling like you're shooting yourself in the foot if you never embrace anyone.The combat is nothing new, but is still fun, if not somewhat repetitive. Your abilities do make you feel like you're a vampire, but you have to learn to love dodging constantly. That said, when compared to other games with similar combat, this feels much clunkier. The main problems are pretty much technical ones, such as the absolutely insane decision to have mouse movement tied to switching targets when you have one locked. The tiniest flinch of your wrist makes Dr. Reid flail around, stabbing the air towards an enemy while the one you were actually trying to hit whacks you from the side. What makes it worse is that this is one of the only control aspects you can't remap. The autosave system is downright hubristic on part of the developers as well, and it is definitely the most frustrating aspect of the game for me. Not only does it mean that you have to completely replay the game if you want to try one thing slightly differently, but it assumes that things like bugged quests don't exist, and unfortunately I have definitely run into a couple. Thankfully, since this is on PC, you can find the files yourself and start backing them up, which I definitely recommend. Overall though, the story, setting, and characters are enough to make me accept the technical problems with the game, but it does make me wish that certain things had been more polished. tl.dr - It's a good game, but it could have been a GREAT game if it was just a little more polished and certain aspects had been thought through more.;Recommended;183.4;2/06/2020;142;1
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;Obviously, this game is a 'hit or miss' for many - but for me, it caters to everything I could possibly want from a vampire RPG, and more. The combat is especially creative, with unique skill trees that highlight your abilities as both a vampire, and a doctor. depending on the trees you decide to build. You can claw out throats, replenish your stamina through combative biting, craft medicines that heal, and poisons that kill. The combat mechanics stay fairly true to the abilities' descriptions - and hitting combos is a treat. There's just something about upper-cutting an enemy and launching them into the air with vampiric talons, while slow-motion blood sprays out of their gaping wounds, that just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Combat aside, the gameplay itself is heavily centered on story and investigative quests, which is another perk for me. I adore investigating, hunting trails, and piecing together clues. Vampyr's investigative features are much like Geralt's in The Witcher: you have your "vampire senses" which turn the world around you monochrome, and hyperfocus on scents, blood trails, and more. You can heal districts by helping people with their ailments, or you can let them fall to the inevitable horrors of an untreated pandemic. You have the choice to be brutal, or virtuous. and every decision has an impact on your journey, and its outcome.Some honorable mentions...Hauntingly gorgeous soundtrack. Rich, dark atmosphere that emulates the eerie, foggy streets of a plague-ridden city, further exemplified by cinematic graphics. Characters with unique personalities, traits, quirks, and secrets that make the world and its setting realistic, immersive, and abundantly explorative. And, of course, my favorite part: low on blood? Just grab a few rats and start snackin'. They're low-calorie, and free!Overall, this game is insanely beautiful, with a gripping story, ongoing air of mystery, creepy and curious codexes and letters sprinkled throughout side quests and the main story, and an impressive amount of versatility for a niche production. I personally could not turn it off, I was so enthralled. I spent hours reading both positive and negative reviews before deciding to buy it, and I'm so glad that I didn't let the negativity keep me away from this absolute gem. For the record, I've had zero issues with camera sensitivity, or "clunky" mechanics. So far, everything runs smooth as butter.If you're looking for all the things I've found in this game, you won't regret giving it a chance.;Recommended;29.5;28/06/2020;215;5

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;Vampyr ReviewFirst ImpressionVampyr is an RPG open-world game in which every choice matters. The moral dilemmas presented in this title are fascinating as they affect the experience on all fronts. When being the good guy becomes a handicap, players are tempted to feast to make things fairer. The duality between doctor and vampire is very thin in a world where the difficulty is tied to the actions you take in-game, and your choices have consequences that can affect your entire run. Will the thirst consume you?ProsCons Player decision shapes the world! Great voice acting highlights story. Moral dilemmas are well-done! Consequences affect whole runs. The soundtrack is phenomenal! Combat can be clunky. No fast travel available. Crashes and glitches. Hard to find items downplays them.Issues from launch still persist. A Famished Hunter Cannot go on for LongVampyr is a game in which I found it very appealing to doubt my choices always, and this is because it is only auto-save, and your actions shape the world that surrounds you. If you do not feast on citizens, you will remain weak while enemies become more vigorous, giving you an extreme handicap. If you consume the blood on the inhabitants, your growth exponentially stronger, speeding progression and unlocking new abilities. The moral dilemma shines through the whole journey, as you might feel your hand being forced by the thirst to be able to defeat the beast and guards that patrol London.During my run, I consumed a lot of people, and I became powerful because of it. I did not fully commit to this idea until past halfway in the game, but after some runs, I realize that I needed some serious upgrades. I at least drained half the cast from their blood, and this was not my intention at first, but powerful enemies can incentivize you to do it! It was entertaining to see the world change because of it, as areas became more dangerous to traverse, and monsters started to mutate more frequently.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2182669104The Combat is excellent but can be clunky sometimes, especially when you are not locking on a target, I would notice how the character would attack or move in ways that I did not want to. Making lock-on more of a prominent feature than an option it can take some liberty out of it. Enemy design is fantastic, as facing certain groups requires either careful planning or good reflexes! From bulked beast that can tear you apart to religious zealots that can use the power of the church to burn and stun you! Besides, their designs are well-done! Boss battles are a bit dull at first but quickly become interesting, having multiple patterns and short windows of opportunity to inflict damage.Immortals with their Puppet Games and PlansThere are four factions in Vampyr, one of them will always be your enemy, but the other three are determinant. Depending on how you deal with them, they will affect your run, and this can range from sending special executioners after you to making everyone sick or helping you heal them. Each faction has its appeal to them, and the characters that share a sector also share the fate of it. Pillars are the leaders of said areas, and should they fall, the whole part of town will quickly decay into a critical situation.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2182667256As a player, this is where you can make your choices. Who will you ally with, which parts of the town you want to save, and which are you okay letting die? The process of healing patients is delicate in contrast to sucking their blood, but each has its distinct advantages. A healthy sector is easier to move around, can sell you essential goods, and have a base for you. Meanwhile, one that is being ravaged can be dangerous at all times and will not have vendors to acquire items. These are choices that the player must plan carefully to enhance their run, both as a doctor and a vampire. Questioning NPC's can yield more significant exp rewards, so it is recommended to get to know them. Should they be sick, they will also produce less exp in turn, so sometimes you can heal for the sake of saving them or for later consume, like planting a garden. You need the plants to be healthy before you reap them for yourself. That is an excellent design! Outstanding design! I was impressed that Vampyr ramifications extend so much over all of the titles, and it was a pleasant surprise! Strong and Weak PointsThe strong points of this game are the soundtrack and the moral dilemmas. Music can be tense and agitated when fighting a boss as you can hear the Cellos in the background while your foe tries to eliminate you. It fits the ambient of the title and further adds to those encounters! It pulled you in more into the game and was perform excellently. The moral dilemmas affecting everything, from areas to the story and the gameplay is brilliant and a new way to experiment with an RPG. They are so integrated that you can see it everywhere, and the title will tell you about it all the time too.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2182671500The weak points of Vampyr are very few, but they are huge weaknesses. For starters, there is no fast travel. In an open world RPG, there is no fast travel, and this can make it painful to move from one side of the map to the other, even though we have hideouts, we cannot move between them quickly, and I think this is a huge oversight. Granted, you can unlock shortcuts as you progress, but fast travel would have been a smarter choice. The other weakness is that there are several bugs and glitches, including ones from the launch of the title. To me, it is incredible how, after two years, issues persist and have not been addressed.X NotesIt was tested on an RTX 2070 S, during my experience as of this review, I suffered three hard crashes, all of them after sleeping, yet there was no loss of progress. One enemy and a boss got glitched and would stop attacking and moving until they were hit a couple of times. Also, a mission objective didn't display correctly until I melee like a lunatic in the area that it was supposed to be. The game suffers from technical issues a lot, but I consider it a good title at the end of the day. Bullets and other items can be hard to find, so it makes them less prominent as vials or other weapons. That's not bad, just odd, as they are not very strong until you get to the purple tier.  Finally… Vampyr is a title placated by issues from launch and some oversight in the exclusion of fast travel, but I still recommend it. The voice acting is clunky at first but develops soon after starting the game and becomes very powerful. The personalization options are interesting, and the dilemmas you will find yourself through the title are a breath of fresh air like very few games deliver. I recommend it to those that enjoy games about detectives, vampires, story-focused and open worlds. If you like this review, give it a thumbs up!

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;Manage your Expectations before you play this gamethat's the best advice i can give , it has ALOT of dialogue and most of it is important to that specific character or his buddy you want to learn about Pros:-you do really feel like a predator and everyone you meet is a potential meal -main story bosses fights are fun-a good amount of skills and "builds" you can try-replayability is off the charts in my opinion-the OST is good and seems to always fit the setting of the game-you feast you become strong you don't you become weak-graphics are great overall, not always though-game improves as you play (significantly at the ending of chapter 3 and beyond).Cons:-the fps is a mess when you unlock it and it feels janky to play on a mouse -game has 4 districts and its a mess and has no travel mode-a bit short it took me 17 hours with doing ALOT of side stuff-normal enemy mobs get annoying with time ( but they do scale with you and change with level which is good i guess)-few weapon choices specially on the first half-some builds make you weak and some break the game, i killed the boss before the final fight in 2 second with a good build even though i was 3 level behind it.Rating: 7.5/10overall had great time with the game but wouldn't recommend it at full price.;Recommended;18.2;7/06/2018;238;6
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;The strongest feature of Vampyr's gameplay is definetly the citizen system. We have the power over lives of almost every NPC. We can help them with their side-missions, cure their illnesses or we can choose to embrace them – get a big boost to our experience points by killing the individual. There is this thing tough. It won't go unnoticed. The game's world – 1918s London reacts to player's actions. It creates an intriguing power dynamic that's very distinc for this title.	The story is competent. It has some strong points but also shows some shortcuts in the writing. 	Gameplay is solid. Weapon variety is decent, skills selection allows for some decisionmaking. Combat system uses formula of managing your stamina bar with taking into account enemy attack patterns. It's slow, laggy and sometimes unreliable but I wouldn't call it bad. It's just mediocre.	Graphics are outdated. Especially in the character models and animation department. Music is interesting and helps create this gothic, dark atmosphere in the game.	This is a positive review because as a game this is a competent title. It's definetly a recommendation for the fans of vampire games but for the rest of gamers it's more like a soft reminder that this game exists, it's fine, it has some interesting ideas, maybe give it a try.

Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;I first played this game back when it launched in 2018, barely thought of it again until now when I decided to play a second time. I realize now that, like most people I approached the game wrong the first time and focused in the combat and vampiric habilities which you gain troughout the game. I remember this had a certain comparasion to Dark Souls and that couldn't be further from the truth, this game is all about the story and it's many branches which will lead you to different endings. I appreciated much more this second playthrough as I focused on the story part of the game, which is by far the best, leaving the combat and the more action packed portions of the game into the background. I can honestly say I see myself returning to this depressing world once again in the future for I know there are certain things I missed about the lore. Overall, a great underrated game.;Recommended;57.7;1/03/2020;115;1
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;I'd had my eye on this game for a while, but never took the plunge. I think I was initially put off by some of the negative reviews, with some of them taking aim at the combat system and difficulty scaling. When this game appeared in a recent humble choice, I was keen to give it a go. I've just completed the game doing a pacifist run (no mesmerising/killing NPC's for additional XP). It took me a while, and the the main hold up was that enemies could be quite overpowered at times, particularly during boss fights. I ended up doing ALL side missions and doing a lot of opportunistic combat to farm XP but that wasn't enough to progress the skill trees to the top-tier which left me at a bit of a disadvantage. I'm confident though, had I not done the pacifist run and mesmerised the occasional NPC for XP I wouldn't have had much of a problem.I really enjoyed the supporting cast of characters around the districts of London. There are several different areas filled with friendly NPC's that you engage in conversation with. As you talk to different characters, you learn "hints" which open up new lines of dialogue with the current NPC, or another that sits within their social circle. The main benefit of the "hint" system to is to increase the yield of XP you receive from mesmerising people. This had no particular benefit to me on my current play through but It was interesting enough to do regardless. I found myself spending a lot of time early doors running back and forth uncovering the secrets of different NPC's which gave their characters more depth.As I've gotten older, I've had less and less time to commit to games, between work and other commitments. As a result I've not completed many single player games in recent years. Vampyr is a rare example of a game that managed to keep my attention and keep me coming back until completion. I've loved it, and I'm a little sad that it's over if I'm being honest. I would definitely recommend.;Recommended;27.7;30/11/2020;77;N/I
Focus Home Interactive;Vampyr;Action, RPG;R$ 139,90;What could be more suave than a smartly dressed, british aristocratic doctor who also happens to be a vampire? Step into the shoes of Jonathan Reid, a charismatic doctor returning to London during an epidemic and glamour, charm, bedazzle or murder and bash your way through the streets of a plagued city looking for the cure and shape it's destiny at the closing of the Great War.As divisive as the good doctor's moral dillema of lusting for blood and trying to do good by his Hippocratic Oath, Vampyr brings Victorian era London to life straight from the pages of Penny Dreadfuls. Grimy, dimly illuminated cobblestoned streets, shady characters and ne'er-do-wells, perpetual night punctured by screams and gurgles, a spattering of blood red on the corner of a bench in a foggy park, the game nails the ambience of Gothic Horror and sets a gloomy, sombre city for you to explore. The soundtrack, which is string heavy and not intrusive, but intensifies just at the right moments wraps everything into a densely sorrowful end of days ambience.The game features 4 london districts populated with very finely done, authentic and colorful NPC's and each one has a lot to say. And I do mean a looooot. If you're a very diligent player and want to really see what each of them has to say, you're looking at hours of voiced dialogue. Everything in the game is voiced and they've pulled off some really well-written and performed characters. Almost all of them feature interesting side quests that will grant you rewards and bits of lore. And I do like the lore. There's a lot of it, spread through conversations, side quests, collectibles and the world itself, in art, books and references. Going all out and combining real world history with vampiric fiction just further enhances the feel of the game.There's an interesting mechanic of neighbourhoods changing each time you sleep, depending on your actions and choices. Have you provided medicine for the sick? Have you helped people or mesmerized them, lead them to a dark alley and drained them of blood? The number of choices affecting the mechanics of this is small, but it's nicely done and brings the city to life. It also helps that every NPC is named and has a personal story which you can further unlock by finding hints. And yes, for the murdering beasts out there, you can actually kill all of them and reduce all the neighbourhoods to hostile places full of monsters. The greatest experience gains are tied directly to embracing citizens meaning, if you're going pacifist, from a gameplay mechanic perspective, you're going to be constantly running around underleveled, butting heads and fangs with a small number of different enemies. They're not very varied, but they're consistent and slightly changing as the game progresses, adding to the compactness of the city and fleshing out the story. The bosses of the game are unique NPC's and feature interesting fights, but do suffer of being a bit padded out with large health bars unless you're playing on the Story mode.The game comes from the folks behind Life is Strange and that signature is visible in how the game plays out through dialogue choices and no take backs. No rewind here to see other choices. Once you commit to something, it's done. And further stamped by the game only having an autosave, no multiple save slots. Some may find this slightly irritating, especially if you're an achievement hunter, but for the purposes of presenting a story, it works really well and it features multiple endings. Jonathan is mostly a set character and there are choices you can make to influence the game to a degree, but some big choices are set in stone for you, just like they are in Life is Strange.Now that I've sold you the game with some fancy world building and ideas, time for some more dreary game mechanics. The RPG system the game features, with some weapon upgrade mechanics, basic crafting of cures/healing items and light skill choices and upgrades is serviceable, but I've figured out very quickly that vampire abilites go by the wayside when you upgrade your life, stamina and blood and find a nice two-handed iron club or a scythe that has parry as a special ability. Conjuring grabbing shadows, claw strikes and great leaps at enemies become rather an ineffective way of dealing with them when the most efficient method is dodging/parrying and just clubbing everything in the face which slightly defeats the purpose and immersion of being a powerful vampire that the game serves you. The combat overall feels slightly floaty, wonky, with some suspicious hitboxes particularly visible on enemy grab attacks and becomes tedious the further the game progresses. It doesn't help that the game repopulates enemies when you rest. The folks at DONTNOD also made Remember Me, and it feels to me that Vampyr pulls some combat mechanics from there, but it features a stamina bar, so you'll need to manage that during combat, while Remember Me was combo based and more action oriented. But, as a person that plays too many soulslikes and gripes about combat in them often, a lot of you can probably safely ignore my combat remarks.As a modest open world game featuring 4 neighbourhoods where you can find safehouses and backtracking, the game is missing a fast travel system. I wasn't bothered by this, the streets of London are very good and I found enjoyment in mind mapping all the alleyways of the city and finding shortcuts you can unlock to more easily traverse it. But I can see how this would be a problem for some people.I haven't experienced any technical problems or glitches and not a single crash (played on RTX2070, i7, 32GB of RAM and an SSD), but I did notice that some recent reviews mention that some of the issues, like glitching bosses and crashes that were present at launch still persist.Vampyr is a well paced, very engaging and interesting story game exquisitely using vampire tropes and real world history mixed with some light RPG and crafting mechanics burdened by some toothless and tedious combat that happens too often. If you're not chasing the achievements like vampires victims in the night, I would heavily recommend playing the game in Story mode just to remove the sucky combat out of the equation of your enjoyment of pretending to be a posh british vampire. It'll have the added bonus of making you feel all-powerful. While waiting for Bloodlines 2, this will fill the void very nicely. Or you can go replay Bloodlines for the umpteenth time.Take a peek inside the Cabinet of Curiosities if you like to walk off the beaten path and only sometimes return to the main roads. You might find something worth exploring. And if you do, thank you for the visit.Follow the Average Achievement Hunter Curator for reviews and useful information on Steam achievements: There's a couple of tricky achievements (finishing the game without killing any NPC's and some collectibles) and the game requires 2 playthroughs or some foreknowledge and backup saves because of the game's autosaving system, but that slightly ruins the story experience. Depending on this, the 100% completion time differs a lot. If you're replaying the game, skipping dialogues does save up a lot of time.

Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;A quick overviewGreedFall is a third-person ARPG developed by a small French studio, Spiders. It takes inspiration in older BioWare games, like Dragon Age, especially in terms of storytelling. Unfortunately, the scale of the game is too big for such a small team and a modest budget. You play as an emissary of Merchant Congregation. There is an illness, Malichor, which plagues your old continent. But there is hope, an island called Teer Fradee, where its inhabitants do not suffer from this disease. You need to find a cure, and throughout your journey, you discover many hard truths about your family, nation and this disease.The storytelling, lore, and characters are the greatest strengths of this game. The dialogues contain many choices that can decide the fate of factions and people. There are not many sidequests, but each one has an actual impact on the story, due to their connection to factions and characters. But it seems that developers lost themselves with creating these sidequests because the main story feels quite rushed towards the end.The gameplay part is quite variable as it offers a decent combat system, stealth mechanics, companions, crafting, and optional routes, which depend on your statistics. You have several melee weapons and firearms, and you can use magic spells, traps, and bombs. There are many more gameplay mechanics, but unfortunately, most of them are rather clunky or half-finished. The same applies to the locations. They are beautiful but also unnecessarily large, empty and lifeless.For its price of 50€, I can only recommend it to fans of story-driven RPGs, who can forgive the clunkiness of its gameplay. I finished the game in 54 hours. I did all the sidequests I could find. If you are looking just for the story, then prepare for about 20 hours of adventure.Pros & ConsProsGripping story and interesting characters. Multiple dialogue choices. Cutscenes are surprisingly well-made.Sidequests are interesting and implemented into the main story having an impact on its outcome.Beautifully crafted locations, and great weapon and armor design. The same applies to factions and main characters.There are multiple gameplay mechanics that make your progression more diverse. Option to change your companions, craft items and more during the loading is great. Game is well optimized, and I have not encountered any major bugs which I would expect from an RPG game.ConsCombat gets boring fast due to an abnormally large number of monsters and humans in the areas. Although the locations are diverse, the interiors of the buildings are the same in every city.The locations are also empty and lifeless. There are no side activities except the arena.Romance options with your companions are weird and compared to the rest of the writing, inferior.Voice acting of minor characters is of poor quality, as well as lip-sync.In-depth analysisYour character, companions, and craftingAt the start of the game, you create your character and choose from three classes – Warrior, Magic, and Technical. Each class includes a starting set of skills, but you have the freedom to level-up what you want. These skills allow you to use magic, bombs, heavy weapons, and others. You also separately level-up attributes and talents. Attributes increase your stats required for the usage of weapons and armor. They also give you a bonus for your damage and health. Talents are abilities that help you during the exploration, such as lockpicking, climbing, etc.You are able to change weapons, armor, and trinkets for yourself and your companions as well. There are five companions. Each one is from a different faction and has its own set of skills. But only two can follow you at a time. This mechanic has a small impact when you deal with a certain faction. The game has a reputation system for companions and factions. If you are on a friendly status with them, you receive rewards in the form of items. You can craft usable items like potions, ammo, and gear. You can also change your gear appearance and stats via the crafting table.Combat and stealthCombat has a standard lock-on, with light and heavy attacks. For defense, you are able to dodge, roll, and parry. You can throw enemies off their balance by kicking them or shooting them. All enemies have an armor mechanic. To do proper damage, you need to break their armor with a blunt weapon. Unfortunately, the weapons are not very diverse. There are no combos or special attacks that would make you want to try them all as they all feel the same. Due to this, the combat becomes stagnant after a while. It would not be a big problem if the game did not throw an unnecessarily large number of enemies at you in every location.The stealth has a standard “eye” mechanic, meaning that you know exactly when the enemy discovers you. You can also perform stealth attacks, but enemies notice you very quickly. It is a useful mechanic but not a fleshed-out part of the game. You also cannot move or hide bodies.You can use a disguise, but this gameplay part is even more limited. You need to wear a faction’s armor. That allows you to move freely in their territory. Companions are invisible to enemies in these modes. Exploration and enemiesThe game has several locations that you can explore. Unfortunately, most of them are unnecessarily large and empty which leads to long pointless walks. There is almost no reward for exploring these as there are only chests and collectibles. The same applies to cities where its citizens are lifeless. The only side activities are contracts and arena. But both these activities just mean more fighting, which you probably do not want to do.You can find camps throughout the locations where you can rest, change your companions, and craft items. This camp is also available during the loading screen along with a merchant.Human enemies have the same abilities and move set like you. Monsters are not as diverse as I would expect from a mysterious and magical island. They are mostly just larger versions of bulls, reptiles, bears, and bats. On the other hand, boss fights are more interesting as they have a more diverse and unique appearance and move set, but you fight them repeatedly too. Game’s performanceIt was tested on i5 8300H, GTX 1060 6GB, and 8GB RAM on high settings. I encountered frame drops only in the biggest cities, while the game was loading. The only bugs I encountered were small graphical glitches. Final thoughtsGreedFall has many obsolete and clunky gameplay parts, which can discourage many people from playing it. However, the game’s story, atmosphere, and quests are overall worth the gameplay shortcomings.Follow our curator page,  Alexander’s Club Curations, if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.;Recommended;53.7;27/11/2019;368;8
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;This review is entirely my own opinion, spoiler free and attempts to go into good depth about the game with a bullet point summary at the end. Using i5 9th Gen, GTX 1660Ti, 8GB RAM. Introduction: GreedFall is an RPG set in a world suffering the wrath of a plague called the Malichor, and you, a legate, set off with an expedition to the island of Teer Fradee in search of its cure. What follows is a gripping story of friendship, war, diplomacy, and exploration as you meet several interesting characters and have to constantly juggle with the uneasy relations of all factions on the island.  Graphics: The graphics are beautiful. Spiders did a stunning job of building the outside world and making it feel lived in. In the day, the cities look busy, used, and dirty, and have all the makings of a new colony hard at work, and by night they are dark, with lovely lighting from various fires that cast a warm, yet eerie glow in the dark, dangerous back alleys. Flora and fauna and excellent lighting in the wild too make the beautiful.  However, water isn’t quite as good and stood out, but it’s only a small part of the world. More noticeable was that the interiors across all the settlements are copied, with some minor differences for different cities. In a world that was otherwise so intricately designed, this felt lazy and it made the cities and their factions feel less unique, which undid the work of the story and culture design that did make the factions feel different.  Audio: Audio was good. The music served to enhance environments or scenes, but it was a background noise mostly and not like Skyrim where it made a moment. It could have been used to better effect in emotional scenes too, but here were few tracks and they did well with what they had.  Ambient and combat sounds are good. Gunshots have a click before the final shot for when the hammer is pulled back and I really appreciate this! Swords have a metallic sound and make a different noise when striking armour to flesh which I also like.   Voice acting was particularly strong. There were some lines that felt acted, but your character (I played female) is very well-voiced. Most of the supporting cast sound great and convey emotion and personality well and I love the accents of the Congregation characters too, just saying. Gameplay: Levelling: Finishing a 45-hour playthrough I’d not got enough XP to unlock all abilities. I don’t know if this was intended but it felt like bad pacing, especially since you’ll meet with things in the world, like jumping or climbing, that need certain level perks. Thankfully, there was in my experience always an alternative way to deal with these situations. Combat: I usually don’t like combat systems like this but GreedFall wasn’t bad. You get various enemies with different attacks and you dodge them, take down their armour, and then health. You can approach combat how you like and while it’s quite intense, it can get repetitive. When fighting, you can’t interact with the world and it started to bug me that when I’d cleared locations, a few days later, the enemies would be back and I just needed to run through for a quest, I didn’t want another fight. You do get XP from fighting but sometimes in a short quest it hurts the pacing. If there’s space, though, you can avoid combat by running past it. However, you can accidentally leave the fight zone during a fight by dodging and this resets the enemy health, so you have to start again. I disliked repetition of bosses. You come against several big monsters known as Guardians, but you will have to fight them a few times. I’d hoped they would just be boss per region and that would be it. Combat was fine, but I feel it was overused, and it got tiring towards the end of the game. Enemies felt needlessly abundant.Followers: They were a very promising part of the game and get I feel slightly let down by their shortfalls. I really liked the individuality of the followers while keeping obvious ties with their factions, and how they interact with you and other characters in quests, but that’s about as far as it goes. I liked the relations system but wish it had gone further. The romance option is not as fleshed out even as in Skyrim. There’s no marrying or buying a house. Outside specific chats that happen as part of quests or romance you cannot talk to your followers and this made the relationship system feel almost meaningless, as did the fact that if followers have a quest waiting, unless you accept that quest immediately, you cannot talk to them. I would have liked the possibility to have more followers too, or at least not have to lose one when another was locked to my team for a quest. I was a little disappointed after really getting to like Vasco and Siora that I had to remove one of them to do a quest for Petrus. I also experienced a bug where Vasco was locked out of my team. I finished the quest without him, but his dialogue appeared on the screen (no audio) since he should have been there, and after that the bug was fixed.  Story: The story was mostly strong. It touches on some heavy themes around the era such as colonialism, genocide, religious persecution, etc., as the different factions and their ideas fight to prevail in an ever-changing world which they want to dominate.You’ll be faced with some hard decisions that affect the relations of these nations and outcome of the game, making them feel weighty and meaningful which I like. It’s rare in a game we have such influence over its events. Choices affect your relationship with both factions and people, and they treat you differently as a result. This is a level of immersion I’ve longed for in games like Skyrim, where no matter what you do people still treat you badly. I like that there are consequences and the game never outright tells you you made the wrong choice, but you feel it if something happens that you didn’t intend.  Sadly, you’re also sent to do your fair share of fetch and carry missions which didn’t feel consistent with the status of your character, and in the late game it hurt the pacing a lot. There’s sometimes the option to automatically travel where you need to, but I would have liked it more often. That, or better placement of fast travel points so there wasn’t so far to run. Since cutscenes were done so well, Spiders could have used them to mitigate this too. Summary: + Strong story, with multiple endings and choices.  + Strong characters, mostly well-voiced and complex.  + Factions each felt unique with ambitions and beliefs.  + Visually stunning. + No microtransactions. + Told about ‘point of no return’ so you can finish quests/achievements before too late. + Great cutscenes.  - No screenshot mode. - Combat overused, bosses repeated, unable to interact with world in combat.  - Can’t get all achievements first time. - Needless running around for quests.  - Parts of world shut off unless quests are triggered, but they can be missed. - Some emotional scenes/quests felt rushed and lacked emotion. - Flaws with followers hold them back. - As female, characters sometimes use male pronouns for you. - Door animations get annoying, slowing you down. Conclusion: Overall, GreedFall is a good game, lacking a little in technical prowess and with a few irritating faults. But it delivers a strong story with choices that feel meaningful, fleshed out with a colourful cast of characters, and set in a believable, beautiful world. It’s held back by a smaller budget and is a little pricey but for a memorable game with good replay value, I think it can be forgiven in a hope they’ll put the funds to good use to make their next game even better. I love the era this game was set in and I’d like to see the developers revisit it, ironing out a few of the flaws in this. I give it a well-earned 7.5 out of 10.;Recommended;44.4;25/11/2020;621;8
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;I played it through, but only to see the ending. After about 20 hours, it was more a chore than fun.The graphics are nice, the story is mostly very good, with different faction you work for, a lot of people you actually get to know. This could have made this a great game almost in the league of Witcher 3.BUT: The missions themselves are often boring. Some missions only consist of Go to X. Talk to X, X cannot help you but sends you to Y, Go to Y. Y says, that he has seen something that might help you, so try to find Z. You run around, find Z, talk to them, and they say "Yeah, I think you need to go to W". And so on. (No, I'm not exaggerating...)Some missions are confusing. For example, you are supposed to free some rpisoners from a mad doctor, but you don't have the key. You try to find it in a house, but you cannot enter it. Why? Because you first need to actually talk to the prisoners so that they can tell you to find the key, then suddenly the door is open. There are several annoying bugs like that.And the talking to people is often really boring. Dialogue is slow, you often only have one dialogue option but still need to click it to fake action. And several of the options you actually have do not affect the game in the slightest.And yeah, choices matter. What this mainly means is that you have to do all side missions, the more you do, the better the ending (especially the side missions for your companions). Apart from that, not much to choose, and most of it quite obvious.The number of opponents is very limited, there are 6 or 7 types, not more, throughout the large map. So fights start to get boring at some point. Add to this that after some time you are not really in need of loot anymore - so I often evaded the fights or even when I finished them, I did not bother to pick up the loot.The companion system (reminiscent of dragon age games) is supposed to make a difference (the game even says "chose your companions depending on their fighter archetype), but I never noticed a big difference in how difficult the fights were. Just choose the companion that works for the faction you are dealing with and that's about all you need to think about.All in all, this could have been a great game if they had put as much care into the mechanics as they put into the story (which is godd IMO). But as it is, it is just a bit too repetitive and boring.;Not Recommended;41.4;7/11/2022;542;6
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;Listen... I just started and want to throw some things out there for people considering this purchase:x) IMPORTANT CONTEXT!!! Spiders is an indie studio of... maybe a few dozen people... and they've managed to pull together a pretty good looking and competent RPG.x) Lip syncing for the dialogue is very poor. 100%. It is an issue, but it is a small one in my opinion.x) You will either love or hate the voice acting. I personally love it and have thus far heard few, if any, poorly delivered lines or performances. x) Combat is basically... Assassins Creed and Dragon Age had a baby. Enemies seem aggressive and fast, the tactical pause works very well so far, and button mashing is definitely not the way to go. It's taking some getting used to but I really enjoy it. (MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON IS TARGET LOCK BY DEFAULT!)x) The game is pretty. It runs well and has just had a few pop in bugs as for my experience so far. Otherwise it has stable FPS with great visuals, and is very immersive given I am able to overlook the lip syncing issues.I will definitely update the review as I play more of the game and ultimately complete it... but if you can maintain the proper perspective, appreciate that this is a less than full price release, and are a fan of character driven RPGs? You'll have a fine time playing this... and again... the lip syncing is bad... if you can get past that (something that can be fixed over time, even though yesyesyes it shouldn't need to be) there is a lot to love here!From the jump I'm just going to say this is a welcome breath of fresh air in an industry loading games with "rpg" mechanics that don't f***ing need them.;Recommended;7.8;9/09/2019;1,359;46
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;I don't write many reviews, but this game definitely deserves it. I'll try and be brief and to the point so we can all get back to playing ASAP! PROS:1. Quest system: after 15+ hours I haven't had a single fetch quest. Most of them you can solve in multiple ways.2. Dialogue: well written and although in old timey style, it isn't pretentious and really fits the game. As a bonus, most voice work is great which is surprising for a smaller dev.3. Combat: its fluid and well executed, tactical pause is a must on hard+. Challenging but not maddening. (unless yoy try and do arena at level 5, bring some pots and antidotes is all I'm saying...)4. World building: factions are believable and they have their own motivations that make sense in game. Natives have many tribes with their own approach, as well. While they reuse assets, it's not as bad as DA2, imo and the game looks good.5. Stability: not a single crash or even major FPS loss (tho I understand this is  down to individual machine probably and mine is a decent rig). CONS:1. While combat is fun, enemy variety is lacking (which I understand, but still).2. Facial animations are off (not hugely distracting).3. Customization of your character is pretty basic, less options than in most modern RPGs.4. Few bugs such as killed enemies stay up (stealth killed Naut guards in New Selene for instance). Not major but definitely something to iron out.TLDR a great, unique western RPG with a few quirks but very enjoyable. Highly recommended! Thanks Spiderman. Err... Spiders!;Recommended;71.5;11/09/2019;350;17
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;GreedFall starts solid, walking on old Bioware paths reminiscent of Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect and Jade Empire. With a party of three, you explore a historical 18th-century expedition setting mixed with fantasy to uncover the secrets of a distant island to find a cure for a mysterious disease. While doing so you have to maintain diplomatic relationships with various factions that have different goals and opinions. The RPG elements are well designed. There is quite some decision making with immediate and long time consequences. Character development is varied for both combat and world interaction and there are seemingly interesting companions with their agenda and side-quests - and of course, options to romance them. The graphics are mostly beautiful, especially the varied areas like the three cities, lush forests, epic mountains and wide fields. The downright ugly character faces and facial animations stand in jarring contrast to that. And these are only the first cracks in the overall picture of the game that start showing early. GreedFall was created by a comparably small developer studio that was punching over its weight here. It shows in various aspects of the game. The combat is clunky and janky. The three cities of the island are small and feel lifeless. Some key buildings that you visit dozens of times throughout the game are literal copy & paste jobs. The world is divided into zones and while they look great they are very limited in scope. Even big forest and mountain areas sometimes feel like small corridor levels that you are funnelled through with tons of invisible walls instead of "exploring". Loot is randomly scattered through the game world. Hidden treasure chests in distinctive areas are often just junk. The stealth and disguise system of the game is a complete joke but can at least be ignored for most parts.All of these problems show pretty early in the game. But I was still interested enough in the world, the story, my companions and building my character to ignore most of the issues. But the more I played, the more bored I got because the character arcs and the main story don't lead to much in the end. The same goes for the side-quests that are ultimately uninteresting. And then it feels like the game completely falls apart in the second half. On the one hand, the gameplay becomes incredibly repetitive and there is a lot of backtracking. You get sent all over the island to talk to person A to get them item B for hours and hours. All while fighting the same five enemies and three boss-type monsters over and over again. It's content for the sake of content and it isn't enjoyable. On the other hand, the story takes the most generic, predictable way you can think of, leading to just another highly generic fantasy tale. The unique setting doesn't get used in any interesting way at all.In the end, GreedFall is a remarkable accomplishment for a small developer studio, but ultimately a very mediocre game with lots of issues. I don't want to hold back anyone to give it a try - it's cheap enough during sales. But I can't recommend it because there are so many better RPGs out there.;Not Recommended;39.8;13/04/2022;617;3
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;Before playing I waited, like a patient gamer, and made sure I understood the various problems other reviewers had with the game.  So I did a few things to make my time enjoyable and it definitely helped playing this game. A few mods that improved quality of life:* Camera overhaul - to get rid of the camera sway* More carry weight - so I could keep exploring and not worry about running back and forth to town* Player complexion - add a bit of nicer textures during close up conversationsAdditionally I used Nvidia Freestyle (basically Reshade) to remove the brown filter and make the colors appear more lush and vibrant. And finally I turned the HUD off completely - I only needed to use the map sometimes, but it was a great way to experience the gorgeous low-fantasy environments in this game.   The environment was my favorite part. the cities were nice of course, and I liked that they weren't massive (I completely disagree that modern RPGs need to have large cities).  It was even better going out into the wild and exploring the pleasant autumnal locales, admiring the streams and trails and seeing what the natives of the island would have enjoyed.  Exploring without the HUD gave it that extra level of immersion. The voice acting and story are good, they go well together and none of the characters feel overboard or poorly represented.  The various factions were each appealing in their own way, even Theleme who I initially disliked, turned out to be not-that-bad. The graphics were quite good but definitely on the heavy side. I played at ultra everything on RTX 2080 Ti, and even so my temperatures went up to around 72C!  Definitely tweak the settings and reduce what you can to get the most out of this game.One thing to note the initial starting area/starting island makes it look duller than it needs to be.  The starting area is just that - a tutorial - get out of there and onto the main story area, the game really picks up there.;Recommended;48.1;20/06/2020;219;2
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;When I stumbled upon this game the first time it didn't caught my attention. I wasn't really interested in the fictional New World, and mixed reviews made me cautious about trying it. Then one of my friends compared it with Dragon Age: Inquisition, saying “it looks just like it”, and I, being a hopeless Dragon Age fan, decided to give it a try. And oh boy, that was a wise decision, because GreedFall managed to make me love it within the first hour.Pros:• The plot. It's engaging, intriguing and magical. The protagonist is a diplomat helping their cousin, who is freshly appointed governor of one of the cities on the mysterious island, so the game is politics-heavy. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found this aspect of the game well-written and interesting. Mix it with heavy dose of magic and you'll get a very thrilling adventure. Plot twists are good, enraging in the best way possible… and sad. I never felt bored.• The setting. It's beautiful, mystical, logical, sometimes eery, sometimes brutal. I didn't have a feeling I'm running between cardboard scenery.• The protagonist is canonically smart.• All of the characters are very well-written and have distinct personalities, even the minor ones.• Level design. The island of Tír Fradí is consistent with its visuals, and the cities have obvious copypasting, but all of them look magnificent.• Fractions. There are four of them (five, if you count the one the protagonist is a part of), and each one has its own long chain of quests.• Sidequests are good, numerous and aren't focused on “kill twenty beasts/collect ten flowers” objectives. There are fetch quests on bulletin boards in the fractions' camps, but they are completely optional and have no impact on the plot. I think I've counted about six or eight of them? A drop in the sea.• You nearly always have an option to complete a quest in different ways. Diplomacy, violence, lying, sneaking, sneaking using appropriate armor to fool your enemies…• Classes. No one is forcing you to be only a swordsman, shooter or a mage: you can stun your enemies with magic, shoot them from the distance and finish them with a rapier. I find that approach very refreshing and fun.• Talent bonuses from the companions. After you befriend them, they add +1 point to your talents. For example, Kurt raises your Craftsmanship, while Siora makes you more vigorous. That way you don't need to maximize some of the talents, while sacrificing others. • Voice acting. It's really good, and there are some familiar voice actors, like Alastair Parker and Ramon Tikaram.• Home base. Every major city provides a residence for the protagonist. You can find there a crafting table, storage chest and fast travel globus. It also gives you an option to rest if you need to do a quest requiring a particular time of day.• Optimization. I have a decent graphics card, but my processor is very old — so old it doesn't meet even the minimum requirements for Mass Effect: Andromeda. Despite that, I was able to play with everything set on Ultra. There was some lagging in the cities, but that's it.• Soundtrack. It's unobtrusive, magical and suitable for every situation.Cons:• Since you can freely explore almost every corner of the map, including plot-related locations, you can stumble upon a spoiler… reading the codex. It updates locations' descriptions according to your exploration progress, and there was a time when I found out a crucial detail about the protagonist just because I visited one of the caves. Not cool, man.• You can bring with you only two companions at once.• …And they aren't the most talkative people. All of them are truly well-written and they gradually open up during the game, but I would like to have more options to talk about personal matters, or hear some banters. They do make comments during the quests, though, and frequently.• An imitation of life within cities and villages — or lack of. Yes, NPCs are walking and doing stuff, but it's nowhere near the illusion of actually living society you can see in Skyrim or the Witcher.• Loot. It's pretty boring, to be honest, and almost all armors are fractional.• No jumping.• Fighting system is a bit clunky and requires some time to get used to it. Dodging and rolling aren't always responsive, so you can get hit even if you pressed the button in time.• The game has a day/night cycle, but not a weather system. • Facial animations aren't great, but you get used to it after a couple of hours.• There are some inconsistencies in the dialogues related to the protagonist's sex. It happened two or three times in my playthrough, but I heard it's a bigger problem in other languages. Luckily, patches are keeping adressing this issue.+/-• It's not an open world game — there are invisible walls and all that. I personally prefer it that way.• Romances. Characters are amazing and flirting is sweet, but romance scenes start somewhat… awkwardly. Romance content is very, very limited, and you can lock yourself out of it if you choose wrong dialogue options. Still, it's better to have this option than not have it at all, I guess.• When you travel to the new zone you end up in the small road camp first, where you can trade, craft and talk with companions, while the level you're heading is loading. It's pretty useful, but if you're doing quests with lots of traveling, these stops can become tiresome. Suffice to say, you can leave the camp at any time — you don't need to wait until the level is fully loaded, it's mostly for your own (and your processor/graphics card) comfort.• There is lots of traveling, by the way. Usually I'm pretty indifferent to mounts, but I wish I had them in GreedFall. Locations aren't that big, and you can set up camps with fast travel option, but you still be spending quite some time on foot.• Character creation allows you to choose a preset, but you can't modify it. Most of them have similar bone structure, but — boom! — it actually has a meaning behind it. I love customizing my characters, but I don't want to complain about GreedFall's chargen: I like its faces.• The protagonist has canonical surname. you can't name them. It doesn't matter that much, but I find that odd.Overall, I give GreedFall 8/10. The game has its issues, but it was an amazing adventure in a beautiful world. I'm utterly happy I decided to give it a try and want to encourage everyone to do the same.;Recommended;85.8;3/11/2019;220;9
Focus Home Interactive;GreedFall;RPG;R$ 17,40;Greedfall is a unique and interesting game to say the least. A lot of people have tried to fully compare this game to Mass Effect 1/2 and Dragon Age 1/Inquisition. Honestly, I don't think such a comparison does the game justice. This is a brand new RPG IP built completely from the ground up by a single or double A studio with probably some of the smoothest performance and most solid gameplay I've seen from an RPG title. That being said, it does have subtle similarities to various other games, but with its own established universe.You play as De Sardet, the cousin of Constantin D'Orsay, son to the prince of the Congregation of Merchants of The Old World. You are a legate, sort of a representative for Constantin and the Congregation once you reach Teer Fradee, where the majority of the game takes place. Throughout the game, there are six main factions you need to be aware of. The Congregation of Merchants are sort of your home base faction. They're interested in trade, profit, and diplomatic neutrality. Next, you have the Coin Guard, an army of mercenaries with an honor code that will work for whoever pays them. After them are the Nauts, a group of seafarers with the ability to expertly navigate from the old world to the new. Next, there's the Bridge Alliance, a nation primarily interested in science and alchemy. Then, we have Theleme, a nation of religious folk who seek to convert the natives of Teer Fradee, among others, to their religion worshiping a being they call "The Enlightened" (their version of a god). Lastly, we have the natives of Teer Fradee, a race of people who seek to protect the environment of the island and worship a variety of creatures, guardians who protect them, and a number of spirits and gods. The basic overarching goal of the game is to go to Teer Fradee in search of a cure to a bloodborne curse-like affliction known as the Malichor that is ravaging The Old Continent.You will gather companions during your adventures that will help in combat and in various conversations/situations. Your first companion is Kurt, one of the Coin Guard and basically the reason you even know how to fight. Next is Vasco, a captain among the Nauts that is reluctant at first to leave his ship and crew, but after being grounded by the admiral, agrees to join you on your adventures. Then we are introduced to Siora, one of Teer Fradee natives who is the daughter of one of the village chiefs. Next is Petrus, a priest of Theleme who we find out we actually met long before the events of the game on the old continent. Lastly, we have Aphra, a Bridge Alliance scientist and expert in ranged weaponry. Your relationship with your companions will vary based on your actions throughout the game. Depending on your character's gender and various dialogue choices, it is even possible to have a romantic relationship with one of them.Now to general gameplay. Combat is somewhat satisfying, particularly against bosses. It can be a bit simplistic though. Fast traveling does exist, sort of. You go through camp loading sequences to get from one region to the next. In melee combat, you have basic attacks, parrying, and fury mode which allows you to deal several powerful hits in a row. You will need to upgrade your armor and weapons with gear you obtained by various means throughout the world. There are also a number of side quests and missions you can undertake between main quests. As you level up, you gain points to spend on three different skill trees: skills, attributes, and talents. Skills are for combat, attributes for general gameplay and traversal, and talents for various character abilities such as crafting or charisma in conversations. Depending on the things you put points into, this will determine your entire playstyle. You can also reset points as long as you have a memory crystal. Also, you'll need to keep an eye on your reputation with various factions and companions. It is possible to make everyone friendly towards you depending on your choices in the game. If you have a friendly reputation with all parties, you have the ability to get probably the best ending to the game. I won't spoil anything, because it's a good story you have to experience for yourself to appreciate.So, yeah, I really like the game. I heard about this before its release and decided to buy it. I was not disappointed. It pleasantly surprised me with how simple and yet how intriguing it was. I really liked all the companion characters and really came to care about them and their motivations. There were also a number of NPCs that genuinely had me invested in the story and made me want to learn and know more. The fact that they also crafted a unique language for the Natives also thoroughly impressed me for a smaller studio of developers. Even if I couldn't understand it all the time, I did learn a little bit of it and I was impressed by its consistency. Overall, an easy 7 to 9 out of 10 game. It does a lot right. Not a lot of bugs or problems. Just a pure, simple, and engaging game that draws you into its world and makes you want to know all its secrets. I definitely recommend it.;Recommended;52.7;4/08/2020;245;3

Focus Home Interactive;SnowRunner;Adventure, Simulation;R$ 99,90;The other day I drove home in my old car. It had already started to snow heavily and it was getting worse. The winter road clearance service was still asleep and the snow kept piling up on the roads. When I turned into a road, my car slid into a snow bank. The front tires were still on the snow-covered road but were also stuck. I stepped on the gas but nothing moved. I just thought to myself "♥♥♥♥, that's it". I got out and thought about it.  While I was standing there rummaging in my trunk to find any tools, I remembered that I played Snowrunnrer a few months ago. I thought about what I did there with the vehicles to get out of the mud and snow. In Snowrunner, you don't just accelerate and hope that the car comes out straight ahead: you wiggle the steering wheel wildly, drive forwards, backwards and then somehow you get out of the mud with maneuvers that are totally contrary to your driving instinct. Well, that's what I tried. Five minutes later I was home. I can recommend the game.;Recommended;13.9;7/12/2023;136;32

Focus Home Interactive;SnowRunner;Adventure, Simulation;R$ 99,90;I’ve put a fair few hours into this game now, so I should probably put some words down on what I think of it. Just the base game. If you want DLC reviews those’ll be separate. I am sure you can look up my reviews on those somehow if you’re interested.Snowrunner is on the surface a driving game where you plug mud in oversized trucks. You never go fast, with the early game bogging you down the best it can and learning you the ropes. I think generally the maps are really well designed in the base game, teaching you what you need to do to excel at this game should you play the maps in order. However, the game doesn’t do a very good job of explaining what’s going on so you might need to play with a friend that can fill you in, or go look up some youtube tips. Also while it might be really tempting to go to the latter parts of the game and get some powerful trucks, or even get the DLC trucks, I would also recommend against that. The front end of this game feels very deliberate in that it’s giving you specific vehicles that will teach you through your faults. That means you’re going to tip over, you’re going to get stuck and generally have a bit of a bad time. If you’re not one that learns lessons through trial and error, this game might be a miss for you.Throughout the game you will unlock roads, unlock better vehicles, upgrades and map knowledge, which is just as important as the tools you’re using. A lot of the time knowing exactly what a route is going to present to you challenge wise is  half the battle. It could be anything from deep mud, aggressive camber, running water, rocks, tight turns, steep hills, icy roads and even fallen trees or pylons. Knowing what to use, where to use it and getting the best from your fleet is the really rewarding part. Speaking of fleet, let's talk about the vehicles in the base game. Pretty much everything here can be useful in some regard. Each truck is assigned a class.Scouts are small vehicles used for looking around the map. They are used for finding your way to watch towers to uncover the map and supply and fix vehicles that might have gotten themselves in a bind. There’s some really powerful ones in the base game, some of which I am still using deep into the season passes, although there are a few better options in the DLC’s.Offroaders are your next class up and they do exactly what you think they do. More capable than the Scouts, but unable to get to places where the more nimble and narrower Scouts can get. Again, there’s a few vehicles here that age very well into the late game should you choose to go that far.Next up are the Heavy class. Heavy are everything the Offroaders were and more, with some very specialised equipment that are more used for a specific task, such as carrying logs, or running fuel in larger quantities than the other classes can. The added weight and strength means they are better at getting your stuck or overturned vehicles out of the mud and snow.Heavy Duty is somewhere between Offroad and Heavy. It’s a mixed bag here, but just pick the one you feel most attuned with. It’ll get everything you need doing in the first 3 scenarios. Finally we have Highway. I’m not entirely sure why this class exists in this game as it’s nearly useless. There is one vehicle that can be upgraded to be very good, but that’s outside the realm of the vanilla game so I won’t delve into it too much.Each vehicle you have can have attachments and upgrades applied to them, some of which unlock after you have earned enough XP to make them available to you. It’s a bit like an RPG where each vehicle you have becomes something you get really familiar with, what it’s capable of and what it won’t be able to accomplish.Missions in the game are broken into a few parts. There’s tasks which are usually just jobs that might take 30 minutes or so, and then there’s contracts, which provide an overall theme and story to each area and offer a big goal to achieve before moving onto the next area. Could be anything between setting up sawmills, installing oil rigs, searching for oil deposits. It’s not exactly Shakespear, but it doesn’t need to be.Gameplay consists of taking everything I’ve just written about and putting it all together. I think sometimes it would be easier to describe this as a puzzle game that is about driving over anything else, because you’re often tasked with dilemmas that have no easy answer. Sometimes the solution is easy, sometimes it’s hard, but often there’s many ways to get what you need done. Different players may approach things in various ways than what another player might. There’s really no real answer.For the most part Snowrunner is a chill game. You potter about in the mud and snow and everything is fine, but things can fall apart really quickly and become very stressful. When you spend a night moving cargo from one end of the map to the other and it keeps falling off, or you tip over multiple times, or even worse you tip over, and then the vehicle you came back in to perform the rescue in tips over as well, it can lead to some ALT F4 moments. I think anyone that has played Snowrunner can confirm this. The rage is just something you let simmer and then come back again when it has dissipated. In the 3 vanilla areas there’s nothing that should really cause massive frustration though, a lot of mishaps come down to bad planning or just not paying attention. Again, you’re going to be taught a lot of lessons by experiencing failure. It’s OK to fail in this game. You’ve nothing to prove. Just get out there and drive and try to make sure you don’t fall for the same thing twice. It can totally be played in single player, but I would recommend bringing a friend along. The extra bit of grunt, the fuel and supplies and an extra winch point are all welcome. It’s my preferred way to play. It’s all cross platform as well if you have a buddy that plays anywhere else but steam. All of this works mostly flawlessly. In the hundreds of hours I’ve played, I’ve seen a few bugs, but nothing that would really mess up a session.While we’re talking about performance, I must mention that you should not buy this game if you’re not running an SSD. It constantly saves and the act of saving stutters the game on mechanical HDD’s. I don’t know why they did it like this and didn’t just have a manual save to get around this, but it’s a weird decision that will impact those of us that play on older hardware. I know it impacted me before I upgraded and it was insufferable and sometimes even caused me to tip.I can recommend this game, even if you only skim through it. Grab it on sale and give it a whirl. There’s nothing really like it elsewhere on the market, some people might be more at home with Euro or American Truck Simulator, but those that are looking for something with a bit more meat on the bones and less procedural generated jobs should feel more at home here. Just be aware that it will test your patience.;Recommended;659.8;6/01/2024;99;N/I

That is why American Truck Simulator did not have a long lifespan for me.I was certain that Snowrunner would amount to the same experience as American Truck Simulator but was happily proven wrong. Snowrunner may be a game about work but doesn't feel like work to play. To describe the game in one word, I would call it satisfying. There are several different vehicles, each with unique handling that makes test driving so much fun, and each vehicle feels very satisfying when driven right. There are several, massive maps with interesting layouts that makes exploration feel satisfying and rewarding. Each task presents an adequate challenge which felt incredibly satisfying to complete, especially so when many challenges require a combination of careful planning, raw skill, and, sometimes, a little bit of luck.I strongly recommend everyone pick this game up, especially if it isn't traditionally your style of game.

Makes no sense to me how you are going to release two DLC's together. One of them included in the year pass and one of them is just some scout SUV's that can do next to nothing in the game, not included in the "YEAR PASS". Why do you need to tax people so much for a game they have already supported countless times? There is no purpose of the "YEAR" pass if everything from the "YEAR" isn't in it. This practice is disgusting and I do not support it in anyway.

Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;To summarise, The Surge 2 is another quality Soulslike offering from Deck 13. Rather than continuing the story from the point of view of the same character as in the previous game (The Surge), you play as a nameless survivor of a plane crash who awakens in the city of New Jericho, which is under quarantine due to an outbreak of a nanite disease.First, I'll get the bad out of the way:Compared to the previous game, this one seems to be graphically less impressive. The Surge set expectations high, with excellent lighting & texture detail, and overall superb art style. The problems that The Surge 2 has seem to be (a) the lighting is off (oversaturated in places) and (b) the world lacks detail in certain places, as if the developer did not have time to add clutter or refine textures to make them look used or weathered over time. for example, some brick surfaces are perfectly flat and flawless as if God himself came down from heaven to show mortal bricklayers how it's done.Onto the good:Combat is much like The Surge except that now there is a new directional parry system. Unlike The Surge, where opponents could be staggered by blocking just before an enemy strike lands, it is now necessary to block AND make a gesture with the mouse in the appropriate direction at exactly the right instant. This takes a lot of getting used to, and to be perfectly honest, three playthroughs later (I have just finished NG+2), I still don't feel like I have mastered it. According to the developer, it's possible to finish the game without using directional parry at all, but I don't believe it to be an optimal way to play. Overall, combat is fun and rewarding, especially when pulling off a directional parry and counter-strike.Like the previous game, new gear and weapons are obtained by finding or by cutting it off something or somebody else. Gear and weapons are upgraded through parts which are (you guessed it) obtained by cutting them off something or somebody else. I cut off enough limbs in my playthroughs to keep New Jericho's kebab shops stocked for months.There are more sidequests compared to the previous game, and they are entertaining enough. Completing them generally provides gear or weapons which can't be obtained any other way.Technically, the game appears to be satisfactory, for me at least, given that an update resolved my performance issues. I experienced a couple of crashes to desktop in 116 hours of gameplay.I sometimes found myself unsure about how to proceed for a sidequest, but I don't fault the game for that. I attribute this mostly to my failure to pay attention to instructions / hints, having become accustomed to modern games that lead players by the nose with quest markers. There are no quest markers in this game, and personally I like that. Difficulty is sufficiently high that, for an old-timer whose reflexes are not what they used to be combined with a completionist bent and a tendency to check every nook and cranny, the first playthrough can easily be 50 hours.I give a solid thumbs up to The Surge 2 and look forward to what Deck 13 do next.;Recommended;116.8;10/11/2019;98;5
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;If you see that mixed up there and you're concerned, the majority of the bad reviews are "Game would not open." or saying the game mechanics suck while at 0.4 hours played. This is not an easy game. You will have to learn. If you don't like learning and dying, just don't even try man.However if you're not someone like that here's my first impression. I really enjoy the way you get new equipment more than I thought I would. The executions are cool (Tho they aren't many) and I've enjoyed collecting various sets so far. The combat is a little confusing. I can't really tell what I need to do to confirm a stagger yet. Mostly how I've been playing is dodging and waiting for openings. The weapons are neat, however the game gave me these duel swords that stack a dot that does MASSIVE damage when the bar fills. It's just plain better than anything else I have. The worlds are big and pretty fun to explore. Most of the time your going to find a dead end with a path you can't access without a certain item. Like the EMP for example. Although perhaps I just missed it. One thing I will say is that the camera can be pretty annoying sometimes. Like as in your view will be in a wall or some random thing and that'll cause you to get hit because you couldn't see it coming. Other than that I'm enjoying it and I'm excited to progress further. If you're a fan of Souls likes than this is one worth picking up but perhaps on sale.;Recommended;6.4;23/09/2019;653;13
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;This game Supports Ultrawide Natively!  Just throwing that out there for my folks with Ultrawide setups.  That being said I'm about 6 hours in and I've just been grinding the first major level after a boss and having a blast.  The new jump mechanics are delightful.  I feel like the drone mechanics are an improvement over the last game.  The limb removal and farming is very similar which I love.  I just kinda fell back into it.  It's a good challenge and the game looks pretty good as well.  For a game to run well on launch day, support ultrawide resolutions, and be fun is sort of rare.  And that the game wasn't $60-70 really made this a great buy for me.  I love the setting, the focus on combat and exploration, and the mixing and matching of different armors, weapons, and playstyles.  I think other developers could take some pointers.  My only positive criticism comes largely from my friends wishing that The Surge 2 supported co-op.  I bet it would take the level layout to another place entirely, but I will say that a game with these mechanics but with co-op sounds like a blast.  Just throwing that out there.  I was looking forward to this for months and I am so happy I had all my expectations met.  I'm a happy nerd.;Recommended;17.0;24/09/2019;127;2
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;I feel bad for Deck 13 cos this game is in many ways being unfairly ravaged. My personal motto with the Surge was, "It's going to get fun soon." In the end I finished the game and felt totally ambivalent about it. Some parts were good, other parts were bland, and some of it was bad. Mostly unbalanced enemies, boring boss fights and same same level design. But for what it was it was a good attempt.However, the Surge 2 is seriously tickling my pickle. Combat feels more fluid, is more balanced and has more customisation. The violence is still epic. The bosses I've fought thus far haven't been incredible, but are a strong improvement over the first. Same same level design is still a problem, but not in any way as much as in the first game, and there are some quality of life improvements past the half way point that are seriously welcome. As for performance there are some issues, however, I'm running the game on very high settings and have had no crashes or serious issues. I had a dreadful frame rate drop when I emerged form the prison to look over what became a very janky city-scape, but that's really it, besides the occasional frame-rate drop here and there. Lastly, we need to support these guys for delivering an awesome game, that they are working hard to improve as we speak. We are pretty spoiled for choice these days, but if we don't stop slagging off smaller dev teams when they don't deliver perfection we are going to end up with companies like EA, Bethesda, Epic etc running the show and then we have a future of uber buggy, trash teir, micro transaction filled crud to look forward to. This is a good game, I hope it sells well and I hope deck 13 make another, and if they improve the next as much as they have from Surge 1 to Surge 2 it will be flipping amazing. No two ways about it;Recommended;35.3;27/09/2019;79;5
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;While i don't really like comparing games, i gonna compare it to "The Surge" a little bit. Because it is the same game series and it's also very similar to the first one. They just took everything good from the first game and made it better. Pros:1. Soulsborne-like gameplay and combat. Really not much changed there.2. Futuristic, robotic, sci-fi setting.3. Great level design and gameworld. Everything is connected again. No corner in the world seems random, there is always something you can discover. Tech scrap, implants, a new shortcut.4. Even bigger variety of armor and weapons. The old stuff and a lot of new sets and weapons.5. Not as many implants to build around, but nearly all of them are pretty useful for the right build.6. Blocking and parrying finally is useful and actualy one way to play the game. I was still using it just on occasion, dodged myself thought the game most of the time and didn't had any problems.7. Drone combat is much more useful.8. So a lot of viewable builds you can go for. Drone combat, parry, ultra-aggresiv, hit-hit-dodge, chicken. Really whatever you prefer.9. Boss fights are even better and more intense. Also a lot of mini-bosses this time around. Enemy placement is great.10. Maybe because i played the first game so often, but i think it is a bit easier.11. Story is better and feels more "whole". NPCs are great and well implied into the plot. Some dialogs and references are just fantastic and just because of that totally worth to play. Voice acting is fantastic.12. Very short, but an absolutly enjoyable DLC (The Kraken).13. Good replay value at least for a second time, because of New Game +. Around 30-40 hours of playtime, with "The Kraken Dlc".14. I encountered no bugs, or crashes. Just a few graphical glitches here and there.Neutral:1. Atmosphere isn't as immersive and intense as the first one and you play more in the outside world. Which isn't bad, but i enjoyed my time while crawling through dark corridors all the time, inside the creo complex a bit more.2. Really dark again in some places, even with your lights out.3. Graphical optimization could be better.Cons:1. While the grind level isn't as high as in the first one, you still need to spend some time farming parts. I hope the change the upgrade system for a third installment.Conclusion:If you like the genre and/or enjoyed the first game, you can't do much wrong and give this game a try. I really can't unterstand that many bad reviews. Don't compare it to Dark Souls, just because it's the same type of game. Enjoy the little gems the Action-RPG genre had offered us in recent years. Like Nioh 1 and 2, The Surge 1 and 2, Code Vein, Remnant: From the Ashes, Nier. You name it. There all good for a few hours of playtime. At least.I highly recommended "The Surge 2" at full price, or on a sale. It's not a must, but playing "The Surge" first might be a good idea.Ps.: Here is my review from the first game if you interested in buying it. https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067265072/recommended/378540/;Recommended;48.9;19/07/2020;65;N/I
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;Deck13 have risen far from their bland and uninspiring Lords of the Fallen outing and have crafted a good mechanical and industrial soulslike in the first The Surge. With the second one, they've elevated dancing, stamina based combat, meaty and gory dismemberments and a small, compact world full of twisting paths and shortcuts to an artform.The Surge 2 puts you in the role of an anonymous Jane/Joe Doe, flying into Jericho City on a plane that gets knocked out of the skies by some kind of disaster. After a few flashbacks of a young girl that was seemingly on the plane with you, you wake up in a prison hospital and need to punch, chop, sever and mutilate your way out through some escaped prisoners, security bots and a heated fight with the prison warden.The story quickly dissolves into typical sci-fi meanderings of AI, mergers of man and machine, some kind of cyberdisease called Defrag, grizzled military jacks, nano machines absorbing everything and turning the world into Grey Goo and all the other tropes you can imagine. Tried and trusted. There are a few interesting characters and some side quests thrown into the mix, but they all seem to be on the comedic side and are not really taken seriously.The true stars here are Jericho City itself, with it's districts, twisting and looping alleys, passages and shortcuts, the game's flowing, breakdance style, chunky combat and the satisfying character progression of collecting weapons and armour pieces and mix and matching them until you're satisfied with the bonuses. Or fashion, like any true Souls player knows.Combat is very dancelike, swings and stabs pushing you forward or sideways as you execute them, swankily melding into finishers and limb chopping. But beware of button mashing. One button press does not always mean one swing and overeagerness will quickly drain you of stamina and leave you exposed. And you will die fast, as enemies pack a real punch, and will flatten you with just a few swings.Dodging doesn't really give you any iframes and you need to pay attention to the direction of enemy swings. Directional parrying is also a great addition to the game, allowing you to quick parry enemies, temporarily stunning them and allowing you to execute huge hits. When you master this, it sometimes feels slightly overpowered. Battery power, usable for healing, finishing moves and several boost injections, is gained by attacking enemies.There's a large amount of different armours and weapons you can cleave and scrap from various gangs, military and robots wandering Jericho City. Targeting individual body parts and then breaking the armour allows you to do a finishing move when the enemies' health bar drops low enough, divesting them of the targeted part with an assortment of deathblow animations. When you do it for the first time, you get a schematic for the part, each subsequent dismemberment gets you upgrade parts depending on the level of the enemy.Armours come in three classes, operator, sentinel and goliath (light, medium and heavy) and give half and full set bonuses usually corresponding to the type of armour. In combination with a plethora of weapon types, from one handed metal scrap blades to giant military axes spewing electricity, you can create builds that focus on specific game mechanics. You could be a heavily armoured tank that relies on blocking and parrying to deliver monstrous blows with a giant piece of machinery or a nimble, fleet footed warrior that uses quick stab attacks with a spear and has reduced stamina costs for dodging.The drone got a hefty upgrade from the first game and is really useful this time, coming with a few different weapons and abilities. You'll acquire it very quickly and there are armours and implants that synchronize very well with it and it can become a viable build.You can freely combine and experiment with different builds and your basic stats can be reset for a very meager tech scrap cost, the game's currency for upgrading. You can further boost your build mechanics with implants, adding even more stat and ability boosting bonuses. Each armour part and implant uses power that increases with your main level. The better the armour part or implant, the more power it uses. A minor gripe, certain combinations become a bit unbalanced and very powerful and can easily make the game a breeze or a leisurely stroll to the end.The bosses are kind of hit and miss. Some are very easy even with inferior equipment, while some are annoyingly tough, multi phased, with weirdly directed attacks and iffy animations to judge them properly. Even with that, levelling, properly equipping yourself and learning those janky patterns can turn them into milder irritations.Medbays are positioned fairly and finding the shortcuts will sometimes surprise you with how well they loop around and make your trips to the boss fights or the place where you got your head smacked in, losing the scrap, short and relatively hassle free. Online play consists of painting graffiti with your drone, leaving messages or a mini game of hiding your banner and the less players find it, the larger your tech scrap reward is when time runs out. It's a bit useless and gimmicky. You can easily farm more scrap  than the mini game gives out.The arhitecture of the City, lots of tight corridors and a few bosses that move fast do cause some camera problems. In the boss fights, you can usually outdistance it until the camera settles down, but tight corridors are another pair of gloves, often causing you to take hits because you're staring at a piece of a brick wall or steel instead of the enemy. And there were some visual bugs and glitches, but nothing major or game breaking.The Kraken DLC, accessed rather late in the game, continues with the man vs. machine story, puts you on a decommissioned aircraft carrier, VBS Krakow, and pits you against robotic pirates in a strange 90's sitcom neighbourhood built on the carrier. It's a bit short, with some tough enemies and a combat arena when you finish, but is otherwise just more of The Surge 2. And that's a good thing. All other DLC's, even the paid ones, are purely cosmetic, bring nothing to the gameplay and are easily avoided.The Surge 2 improves on the first game in every way. From the bedlam that is Jericho City to the really crunchy, satisfying combat, Deck13 have fused very solid gameplay parts to some slightly brittle tehnical and story ones, but have made a sturdy, enjoyable compound that stands as a solid and competent soulslike.More off the beaten path games, wonders and failures at the Cabinet of Curiosities.Follow the Average Achievement Hunter Curator for reviews and useful information on Steam achievements: Most of the achievements are straightforward, there are a couple of side quests you need to pay attention to, a few collectible missables and the game has 2 ending achievemenents.

Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;In the contest between this and Code Vein, the winner of the Soulslalike contest is... Both of them!TLDR: Both this and Code Vein are worthy purchases, albeit for very different reasons, which game is your cup of tea will depend heavily on personal preference, I'll go into that below.The Surge 2 follows up as a direct sequel to the original, and storywise assumes that you modified the payload that goes up into space with the USB stick that you get from the good doctor about midway through the first game. This has the net result of preventing the worst of the Utopia launch, namely killing everyone very quickly, but also results in the nanites picking up elements of the boss you fight at the very end of the first game. I'm trying to avoid too many named spoilers but covering this element of the story is important because it sets the stage for the world you enter in the second game.This time around, instead of playing as Warren, you get to create your own character, with a choice of background (which has a minor narrative impact), and you can set your gender, customise your looks, and much like any souls game, set everything up to your liking, before you're thrust into the game proper. Enter pandemonium, you start off in a prison hospital where everything is currently falling apart, with rioting in the cell blocks, and something very big and ugly ripping the structure and guards a new one.A much more intricate world than the original, albeit at the expense of the overall sizeMap design in the second game is best described as knotty, the number of shortcuts and loopbacks in each given area is impressive, and you're never far away from a path back to a medbay to bank your tech scrap, or field an upgrade to your power core. This does come at the tradeoff that the maps are more dense, instead of being expansive horizontally, they compensate in being more intricate and expansive vertically, in some places this works exceptionally well such as downtown Jericho, in Port Nixon however it ends up making the area feel somewhat bland and lacking in identity (the port really could have done with being more sweeping). This map design gets remixed at the half way stage once you defeat a specific boss, and the story essentially moves forward in a very permanent way, this refreshes the maps and prevents things from getting boring, but then opens up one of my more definite criticisms of the game. The nanite enemies make a very unwelcome return, and in force, and boy do they annoy the timber out of you. In the first game they were gimmicky, the gimmick here seems to have gone for the most part, replaced instead by absurdly fast, sweeping blow mobs that can, even with heavy armour, four or five shot you. You're going to want to invest in armour upgrades in a big way once the midway point kicks in, and ensure your weapons are up to scratch, because the difficulty jumps significantly.Mechanical improvements all around with perhaps two exceptionsThe Surge 2 has made several very welcome improvements, the drone now works using an ammo pool that can be refilled by killing enemies, and extra ammo can be banked at a medbay (in fact you end up drowning in the stuff even if you drain the clip of the drone regularly), the much maligned weapon skill grind has gone, which given the sheer variety of weapon types has climbed significantly, again, is really welcome. Implants are now all treated as hot swap types, so you can experiment with different build types, also welcome (though the seeming lack of exo-rig upgrades to this point is annoying, the first game allowed for 16 implants max, this looks to top at 12). I've not *finished* the game, so if there is an exo-rig upgrade for more implants, let me know.Less welcome is the directional parry system, which adds a needless bit of fiddling to what is a simple concept, if you block at the exact right moment, you should be rewarded, now instead you have to use the right stick to match the direction of the attack at the right time whilst holding the block button. This is fiddly and with some enemies, a real pain as their attack patterns are too unpredictable to make this work properly. The original parry system worked -fine-, this feels like adding a third wheel to the bicycle.The other complaint is that whilst you can now upgrade implants that provide injections such as heals, you cannot upgrade other implants, this seems like a massive oversight, because that would allow you to fine tune your build. Perhaps they can fix this particular issue, because being able to upgrade one set of implants but not another feels really arbitrary.Closing thoughtsIf you loved The Surge, this is a no brainer. If you love soulslikes, this is a no brainer. The combat is very much of the Dark Souls vein, albeit with a voice of it's own and enough added on top to feel interesting (the original game is still one of my top recommendations for people looking for a change from Dark Souls itself), if you're fresh to the Souls genre as a whole, I'd *slightly* recommend starting with the original, and then moving up to this one once you've mastered the original. It'll make the learning curve a lot easier. But that really is personal preference.Oh, and obviously, if you like your souls with Anime, Code Vein is also there for you. But that review is elsewhere.Verdict: Essential, naturally;Recommended;28.1;26/09/2019;111;4
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;What a fantastic sequel.Even though I preferred the lonely feel of the first game, this sequel is superior in every way.The combat is still awesome. I had a high stamina build and was playing super aggressively, kind of like Bloodborne. Cutting off limbs and looting body parts is still a fantastic and unique way to gear up and really makes this game special. The armor designs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome. Seeing a new enemy always makes you go "oh damn, i want that helmet" You can also do the same thing with boss fights and it makes every new enemy you meet extra exciting. The level design has a TON of variety. Cities, factories, caverns, parks, military camps. They really took the complaints from the first game to heart. The second half of the game can get a bit confusing and you'll probably get lost, but no major complaints.There's a ton of special characters this time and you'll meet some pretty good ones. I especially liked  the Johnny Cage-like washed up actor who decides to be your sidekick. I wish I finished his quest so I can take his cool helmet. It's REALLY cool. Overall, there's a lot more humor and character this time.tl.drIt's an awesome sequel. One of the highlights of 2019. If you enjoyed the first game, you will LOVE The Surge 2.;Recommended;33.0;26/02/2020;72;2
Focus Home Interactive;The Surge 2;Action, RPG;R$ 49,33;I loved the first Surge when I played it on console. Sci-Fi Souls-like which was fairly unique at the time, considering that the game was functional, and scratched that itch. Then a few years after the sequel's release, I finally got my hands on the Surge 2. It is indisputably a better game. The "dismemberment = loot/upgrade mats" thing is the same, the bosses are more interesting, but there's more enemies, loot, and the levels have a higher quality feel to them than the first game's. Not to mention the story is more engaging and cohesive (not to mention its only an indirect sequel, so people who haven't played the first game need not worry about it). It is exactly what it, and every sequel, should be.All of that is why it hurts so much that I cannot recommend this title, and I'm surprised that people do. There is an issue with the game, which has been around since launch. Unlike some negative reviews over bugs or other technical issues, this one seems to be experienced by most players, making it fairly ubiquitous. As part of the game's PC version, a DRM program occasionally runs on computers that are connected to the internet, to make sure you aren't pirating, etc, etc. The issue, for most people, is that this program is unusually CPU-intensive, and often causes the game to drop substantially in frame-rate which, for an action game based around the player and enemies being both reactive and quick, feels really awful, especially later in the game.There are workarounds, and its not game-breaking, but the fact that the developers never changed this, and requires modding or messing with the game's priority settings, etc, means that I just can't recommend it because I KNOW someone who does not have the patience/know-how to do so every time they open the game will quickly come to regret their purchase.Tread with caution.;Not Recommended;10.8;24/01/2023;259;14
Private Division;The Outer Worlds;RPG;R$ 159,90;No one is going to read this, so I'll make it quick. This is a solid game with good controls, very few bugs, a decent story with solid writing, and enough variety to stay interesting. I ended up buying the DLC.  I like the game well enough to spend some added dough.;Recommended;73.5;16/01/2021;915;49
Private Division;The Outer Worlds;RPG;R$ 159,90;Not Obsidian's best work, but a solid role-playing game that is hopefully the beginning of a larger story.STRENGTHS+ Wide level of role-playing. Stealth and diplomacy are as viable as combat. A good degree of non-linearity and sequence-breaking is permitted i.e, you can find a mcguffin before the quest-giver even asks for it.+ Works out of the box and requires no mods to get running. Never coughed and died on me like New Vegas despite loving that game.+ Combat can be a cluster-fudge but it strikes the right balance between player skill and RPG elements.+ Has numerous changes to the WRPG formula I hope become commonplace. Inventory-management is easy, there are no inane hacking or lock-picking mini-games, you can respec your build for a small price, and companions never break your stealth.TRAITS~ You might have to tweak the ini, to avoid that signature Unreal Engine pop-in.~ The game has 20 hours of content, about half the size of New Vegas. Rest assured it doesn't outstay its welcome nor does it end in an inconclusive cliff-hanger. It keeps itself modest and doesn't end with half the last act missing (KOTOR II), leading to a sequel that will never come (Tyranny), or have a major faction with meagre side-content (New Vegas' Legion)~ The difficulty can be a bit too easy overall. I recommend Hard for a first-time player since you can even the odds of battle with two allies wearing top-of-the-line gear.WEAKNESSES- The last zone Byzantium is the one place that suffers from cut-content. Outside of some story-beats there are only a handful of rather lame fetch-quests.- Some good looking vistas feel underutilized. Roseway is the prettiest zone but you can wrap up your business there in an hour with little incentive to smell the flowers.- Some quests are a little predictable if you've played other role-playing games. There's the "Broken Pedestal" trope, the "Secret Clan of Cannibals", and the "Sinister Retirement Euphemism".CONCLUSIONI would recommend The Outer Worlds when in the 30-40 euro price range. It's a solid role-playing game that hones a lot of Obsidian's conventions and aims to create a new setting out of whole cloth. As someone who grew disgusted with the direction of Fallout after New Vegas I welcome anything else that lets me skip a fight with a [60 Lie] skill-check. It is above all a modest game that doesn't hit the same highs of previous Obsidian games, but never sinks to the same lows like being bugged up the arse (Alpha Protocol) or having the 3.5 edition of D&D (Neverwinter Nights 2)8/10.

Private Division;The Outer Worlds;RPG;R$ 159,90;So I'll be honest, I came into this game after being an avid lover of Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian's last big-name project, and it doesn't live up to that. However, I'm still giving it a positive review, and I'll explain why.==Gameplay==Really solid. The controls feel natural without having to rebind anything, the gunplay is very nicely set up to allow you to go loud or be stealthy, and things seemed to flow nicely as the game progressed without any issues.==Story ((SPOILERS))==Good, but too obvious. I came in expecting a game where there would be multiple factions where each had their pros and cons and there was no clear right answer, but well before I made any critical decisions I had come to the conclusion that there was one sensible man in the system and a few corporations worth of self-centered idiots. Sure, it could be worth playing through as the Board for their perspective, but I just don't see myself identifying with them when the correct answer is so blazingly clear.==System==Good. I wish I could be more specific, but this isn't really something I can put on a 1-10 scale. Either it works or it didn't, and this did. No bugs except for one point when I accidentally trapped myself behind some crates and couldn't get out until I reloaded a previous save, and I blame myself for that.==Replayability==This is where my main cons come into play, both for the reasons marked above in story and one other: it's really short. I felt like I was just getting used to things when I realized the story was already building to the conclusion, and even doing the companion sidquests for everyone I liked and everything else that looked interesting wasn't enough to really pad it out for me. It's also really easy to find in-game tricks to let you skip the last two combat levels completely with a half-decent score in your social attributes, and as such I was able to literally walk through what should've been the war sequence without firing a shot. Overall, it was a fun ride and a good story to tell, but I don't think I'll be coming back to play it again anytime soon.==Peril On Gorgon==OH MY GOD YES. This DLC was really what pushed this into the Yes category for me. There are no new companions and only one new area with it's associated story and sidequests, but holy heck were they worth the money. Forget everything I said up in the story section up there. the decisions you make will be agonizing and you'll be left wondering what could've been if you had chosen the other path, and even the most innocuous choices can have huge consequences in the endgame. All of the new dungeon areas are brilliantly made and actually require you to use all the skills you've picked up throughout the game to get through, and the new weapons are among the best you can get, and you will absolutely feel like you earned them by the time they're in your hands. If you do it before the final dungeon like I did it helps you pad out your play time with something that feels like it's making a legitimate difference in the story world, and overall I can only wish the entire game had been made to the same level as this DLC.;Recommended;47.5;22/12/2020;167;2

We pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed. We crashed and he asked if the kerbal was OK.

Private Division;Kerbal Space Program;Indie, Simulation;R$ 72,99;To remove any doubts, this is by far THE best space simulator out there. The Good Amazing learning experience Choose where you want to go, with what, when, and how. HUGE planets to discover, literally, thousands upon thousands of kilometers to walk, drive, or fly your epic creations (or, if your not very creative, preset or other players' ships) Create awesome rockets, landers,ore collection/ astronaut housing bases on other planets, and spaceplanes, the way you want them Fun science mode to work your way up, earning "science" in order to get better equipment and rocket parts (I recommend for newish players who know at least basic orbits / how to get to the Mun) "Creative" mode where all parts are unlocked (great for testing and trying new things) "Career" mode for those really wanting a challenge (balance economy, science, and reputation for your own space organization, I recommend having a little more experience before jumping right in) The Career mode adds A LOT of purpose to the game, as well as adding new challenges such as having to make landings in certain locations, sending satellites in specific orbits, making space stations at specific altitudes, placing a flag on a certain body, collecting ore from a planet, etc. They are still adding to this game... Additionally, there are several user created mods that really expand on the experience, adding new parts or game mechanics. Built off of real physics! One doesn't just lop space junk up into the sky. one must deliver that space junk the realistic and correct way, thus rendering Kepler and Newton proud!!! (generally speaking, it allows one to see how actual launches and orbits work in the real world) Many other great aspects to this game (however, this would be a long list with all of them)The Bad Graphics aren't the best, however, they are still good and create a real sense of depth and can deliver a "lost-in-space" kind of a feel... It makes me feel so small compared to the vastness of our world. Plus, the graphical style really fits the style of the overall game.  Somewhat steep learning curve- It took me a while to learn to get to the "Mun." After this achievement, it was a lot easier to get to Minmus after this. It was difficult to get to Duna, however, once I got there, I have gradually learned enough to go pretty much anywhere and have made a permanent base on Laythe complete with science lab, crew pod and a brand spanking new air breathing engine jet transport, as well as a souped up Rover for them to drive. I have been to almost all of the planets. So basically, it takes time to get "good" at this game, but I assure you, it's rewarding and so spectacular to see how huge this world is (And this one is scaled down, too!). However, new tutorials should be very helpful for the beginner.  not too much music (it's still good, just gets repetitive sometimes) (*ahem* devs please add more music)  Getting to further out planets can take a long time, because it is a little more difficult and takes more resourcefulness... (several hours if your like me and really take your time, especially if you send a 3 manned mission to Eeloo... [you'll get faster the more experience you get though])Overall, this is a wonderful simulator offering a lot of real science with fun, providing lots of hours of engaging gameplay. I am so happy the developers have successfully brought this amazing game out of beta. I have purchased this game so long ago, and the updates have vastly improved the game and have solved many of the problems I have dealt with. Thank you for reading this book of a review, and I hope this really helps. Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions, I have over 400 hours logged and played the demo for several hours.

I waited for this game. I nourished big hopes for Disintegration. But this. This is not the final game. It lacks of polish and content. It could be a beta, but it is not the full game, and it IS NOT worth 50 bucks. You worked hard, and I truly admire you. But something feels off. Like the game was rushed. I mean, so many thing are not working :- Cinematics could be epic but are cut in an awkward way. So the potential tention is... falling flat, and I don't care about the characters despite some great lines of dialogue.- A garage/base that has no interest at all and is too big for the purpose it fills.- A solid gameplay, but almost no diversity in enemies or situation. It's like you created something awesome, but don't know what to do with it.- The game feels... I'm so sorry to say that, boring.What to improve :- Better writing of narrative and quests. Better staging of the cinematics.- An smaller hangar, but full of things to do, and if you keep it big, please at least give us a RUN option.- More enemies. More diversity. More challenge.- More dramatisation and please please please a writing that makes us care about the characters, because there is so much potential here.- Being able to personalise gravcycle loadout and team abilities. It is CRUCIAL if you want us to feel in control of the situation. As it is now, I just feel... trapped into what you want me to do.- Action is E button. I'm sorry. Not F.

Private Division;Disintegration;Action, Adventure;R$ 159,90;Wait to buy for when it is on sale and hopefully patched to fix some truly asinine annoyances that should have been caught in QA.Reminds me of late 90s/early 00s FPS-RTS hybrids like Battlezone II, Giants: Citizen Kabuto, Machines: Wired For War and Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri. Of them all, more so scratches a long dormant Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri itch... streamlined with more fluid controls for giving orders while simultaneously providing air support/kicking butt.So far MP has been a blast and requires real team coordination to succeed - hopefully people will stay interested in MP longer than a week. Story is decent, not great or revolutionary, and some of the cast of characters may grow on you during the explore-lite between mission interludes. Has some interesting mechanics as you learn to combine abilities and exploit builds to stagger and stun enemies for easier kills.Disintegration didn't go far enough with things that can be destroyed. Was excited when I saw a concrete roadblock crumble away and a house fall to pieces due to weapon fire, but that didn't translate to trees and some (but not all) structures. Would have been nice if explosions left craters. Seeing roadblocks and some walls fall apart due to weapon fire but not anything else (given how littered environments are with trees) makes it feel like a half-assed & aborted attempt. Shame. Could have added and extra dynamic element to environments if trees weren't immortal protection [Edit: Oddly, you can shoot through some indestructible objects...]Lots of a cool bits not taken far enough (3rd person base exploration. lack of cosmetic unit customization outside of MP) and something feels slightly off between perspective & size of units at high res. For what it's worth, enjoying it, but wish devs had pushed this idea a little further. Also be warned... some missions feel like they were designed with cruelty and not fun in mind.  Really cretinous difficulty spikes dealing with "waves" of enemies in poorly designed "arenas" where you're more likely to get stuck as your troops ignore enemies at point blank range in favor of further out mobs that don't pose an immediate threats. Having reached the poorly designed pulse/blackout tower mission this game went from fun to frustrating hot mess in less than 30 seconds. [Pro-Tip, I beat this by avoiding the "arena" with the object you have to destroy and by luring mobs out of that circular area to clear them out, then trying to rush back to destroy the next object. Trying to fight in that circular area is f-ing silly since you can get stuck on f-ing everything];Recommended;7.2;15/06/2020;131;7
Private Division;Disintegration;Action, Adventure;R$ 159,90;There's a great game in here somewhere... but I can't seem to find it.I admit, I had pretty high hopes for this game. It appeared to be a pretty interesting and creative game that featured a unique blend of FPS and RTS gameplay, two genres I really enjoy. And it wasn't a  bad  game per say, it was just very... limited. Since I have mixed feelings about the game, I'll give a breakdown of what I thought was/wasn't done well, and ultimately why I decided to leave a thumbs down:Pros:It has an engaging story/narrative, this was probably my strongest incentive to play through the campaign.Good graphics, even on medium settings. The game is very well polished. I never encountered any glitches, frame drops, or crashes.There are plenty of likeable characters with good voice actors.The core gameplay is pretty solid. It's especially fun when you get to use some of the interesting mid/late game weapons.Cons:The game is unnecessarily restrictive, in my opinion. Before you start each mission, there's a briefing/loadout screen, only you don't get to choose your weapons. Or your Gravcycle. Or which of your squad-mates go with you (although, this last one could be justified for plot/narrative reasons). It's all pre-selected for you depending on the mission, leaving you with almost no agency in this regard.The world looks vast, open, and begging to be explored despite there being invisible walls EVERYWHERE. If you veer even somewhat off the path the game intended, looking for easter eggs or secret loot stashes perhaps, you will be met by nothing but the world boundary and disappointment.Despite being part RTS, it offers very little in terms of strategy. When you issue a command to your squad, you can only issue it to  all of them at once,  meaning your squad can't do more than one thing at a time despite being, well, a squad. On top of that, there are only 4 commands you can issue: Move, Attack, Interact (with objects in the world), and Use Ability (albeit, this command can be issued to individual squad members). And they can't execute two commands simultaneously, meaning if you tell your squad to move to a certain position and then attack, they will move to the position and then immediately abandon it to charge in and attack directly.The saddest part of it all, and ultimately why I decided it deserved a negative review, is that it seems the devs are completely giving up on the game to the point where they're not only discontinuing updates and patches, but  outright removing the multiplayer mode all together.  It's a shame to see so much potential go to waste.;Not Recommended;21.6;25/03/2021;42;N/I
Private Division;Disintegration;Action, Adventure;R$ 159,90;Fun mechanics and intriguing story at first, but more and more issues pop up that drag it down from sorta fun to insanely boring and repetitive:1. Everywhere feels empty. EVERYWHERE!!! Your base, the forest, the cities...everything is pretty background-wise but there are so few buildings and close environmental details. Your base is a dead echo chamber you have to jog around for over-echoed dialogue. Bad.2. Little to no gameplay music. More bad.3. Targeting is buggy and AI is stupid as fnck and will run around getting blasted until you have to swoop in for the revive and put your slow fragile self at risk. 4. Multiplayer is pretty dead. Long queue times for matches with poorly balanced loadouts where range gets stomped by rushing DPS loadouts. I wanted to like this game but it just feels like they did what most games do these days and rush them out missing features, story, mechanics, and performance polish. Sure it runs great, but with such an empty world that is not very impressive. Put in some time to boost the NPC's, objects, wonky AI, and add some more music it could be okay. For now, I'm hoping for a refund.Edit: Left the game running during lunch, so refund is denied. Let's hope it get's patched or I just wasted $50.;Not Recommended;4.0;15/06/2020;96;5
Private Division;Disintegration;Action, Adventure;R$ 159,90;terrible experience. very slow, boring and limited gameplay, the hardest difficulty is impossible to maintain sanity through...not because its hard, no the AI repeatedly kill themselves by running out into open fire mindlessly after killing an enemy and getting themselves killed instantly and you're stuck with a single option of diving in to save them before you fail the mission and cringing at the awful audio file that plays only to have the same thing happen 3 seconds later.The grav cycle is slow and limited to 30 feet in the air restricting movement and gameplay so severely you might as well sell it for scrap and walk only there is no option to exit the vehicle.

Private Division;Disintegration;Action, Adventure;R$ 159,90;I really wanted to like this game. I even pre-ordered it. For a long time I have been seeking a RTS / FPS hybrid, something with impactful combat. The previews made it look like this was just that game. It really wasn't. Most of this game involves slowly dragging your brainless troops from area to area and shooting enemies with your blasters form draw distance so that they don't kill you - ending the mission. Any time one of your idiot minions takes too much damage you're forced to go into the fray to resurrect them, putting you at extreme risk since you are just a slow, floating bullet magnet. Because of this game loop players are encouraged to play very cautiously and defensively, especially since the game has regularly sequenced ambushes where your weak bodied minions will get ripped to shreds if you don't pull back immediately. The strategy in this game is sorely lacking - there is only ONE command button for your troops: "attack this target", and it doubles as "stand here". Otherwise you can only issue them a follow order and to use their underwhelming special attacks. The troop AI is braindead, you are always outnumbered, and usually flanked with minimal cover. The upgrade system is super shallow with no meaningful choice or player agency. The levels are 100% linear and pretty boring to look at, looking good for 2001, maybe. I was really hoping this was the FPS/RTS hybrid game I had been waiting for. Nope. Not even close.;Not Recommended;6.3;4/07/2020;92;4
Private Division;Disintegration;Action, Adventure;R$ 159,90;The game was novel, but clunky. Needed a bit more work to smooth things out. Story was interesting.Now they've shut down the multiplayer, and it doesn't look like they'll be updating the game.You can safely pass on this one. If you're curious enough, wait for a sale. I imagine it will be on deep discount, soon enough. A shame.;Not Recommended;11.5;30/11/2020;47;2
Private Division;Disintegration;Action, Adventure;R$ 159,90;DisintegrationMh, where do I start to write my Review to Disintegration.Maybe first, it looks beautiful and runs smoothly at 60 fps.The sound is very good and also the voiceover is good. Yeah maybe sometimes not quite syncron but it's not a pain in the ass, because the voice actors do a very good job.The cutscenes are beautiful and coherent and bring the character and the story across very well.As for the characters, I like them and they are well developed and designed. I have played 4 missions so far and when one of them falls in battle it hurts. But here the game mechanics are designed to let him spawn again. So all is well. I for my part have taken them to my heart, maybe because the emotion chips make them very human.You control a Gravcycle with weapons equipped. Well here I noticed that you are given fixed weapons in the missions. Do I like it?! No. Since everyone plays differently, you might prefer different weapons in this or that mission. But you have to live with it. This and a small sentence below, if you had left out the multiplayer and put the generated potential into the main game. Would have been better. Talk about the hangar, rebuild it and integrate it much better in the game.Like the possibility to upgrade your Gravcycle with found resources, to upgrade weapons, speed etc. etc.Also the level system of the whole crew, which is implemented with expansion chips, is not bad. You can find these chips in the missions.About the challenges in the chapters, there is so much to say, that some of them are very unpleasant and some of them are simpley corrosive. A fun and exiting or chalenging task can look different.About the enemies, as I said, I'm only at the beginning here, they are interesting and can be challenging.I think it could also become very crisp in the further course of the game. Also the maps are beautifully designed and are well made for the missions, with partly destructible environments, tactical corners etc..The sound and soundtrack itself is very good and i love it.The only bad experience so far, in the second mission "One´s Suffering", last enemy group and the game crashed. Ergo play the whole mission again, because no access to the cache points possible. 45 minutes my ass. Very annoying, but okay happens. Since then, no crash has been recorded so far.Disintegration has a multiplayer, was it necessary?Honestly, NO.If you would have left out the multiplayer here, and maybe put on a COOP in the game and developed the main game better, you would have had more of it. What is also not possible at all is the coin shop in the multiplayer. Now some will say, well you don't have to. Yes, true but in my eyes it's completely nonsensical and unnecessary.  You could have also integrated the hangar, the control center in the game, where you start the missions, much deeper into the game. Unfortunately, this was not done.A friend also wrote a review and he played it until mission 8, I think his review is a clear NO at the moment.Um, I like games like Disintegration, BUT- currently too expensive, in sale at 66-90% - then you can buy it.- Multiplayer completely unnecessary- Multiplayer Coins Shop nonsensical and a cheekNow I come to a point which is a great touch to the game, but which I miss painfully:Captivating single-player campaign: Marcus Lehto, Halo co-creator and Creative Director of Halo: Reach,wrote this brand new sci-fi saga. I´m sorry, guys, but i can´t feel this.So I am done with my review here.What is my final score for disintegration.I like it and it's fun. BUT ~~ can I give a clear recommendation to buy? No, I cannot. The game lacks depth. The Multiplayer and the Coin Shop are a cheek. Simply away it is just too expensive for that. In SALE at 66-90% Discount - you can buy it without hesitation.You just have to decide how much you want to spend at that moment.Is it at 60% Discount worth to buy or not.I bought it in the current sale at 40% - do I regret it? No, it's okay, but for everyone else, i think 15€ is the pain threshold.Supplement:What i find a bit pity at the moment, is, that Disintegration just has now a total negative hype of reviews.Not only now, in this case, but in general the last months.But why am I criticizing this?What good are 150 negative reviews if you don't see and understand why or what caused it, to rate this game in this review negative? If they consist of 3 words.Here are some examples:- Not even worth playing for free (Why?)- Sadly it's overpriced (Price to high, true,  but what is with the Game itself? Good or Not?)- What waste of potential (Why?)- Not Recommended! (Why?);Recommended;14.8;2/08/2020;70;5
Private Division;Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 149,90;This is a very hesitant thumbs up, and even then I'm not sure it's correct. I'd only suggest picking this up if it's heavily discounted. If you're not sold on the theme, skip over it entirely.Somewhat amusingly for a game about evolution, the biggest problem Ancestors has is that everything follows a rigid formula. I don't think the devs finished making the game. There's no story, no objective, no purpose to evolution. It's super shallow. It's also kinda fun, but this might be 'fun to watch a car crash' style fun? I'll try and break down what went wrong, and why for some reason I still enjoyed bits of the game.The game also adamantly refuses to use terms like 'skill tree', 'experience points', etc. For the sake of the review I'll use them, but note the game uses confusing terminology throughout.First, the controls. Oh heck the controls. The game has too many actions for a typical controller, so it ends up using a context-sensitive system. However the buttons used are not ideal. For example (using a 360 controller), holding A will sprint. Releasing A whilst moving will jump. Releasing A whilst not moving will cancel a jump. Pressing A whilst falling will grab onto something, if there's something to grab. Pressing A near an item will pick it up/interact with it. Pressing A whilst holding a consumable item will consume it. Pressing A whilst standing in a body of water - with no items in hand - will drink the water. Pressing A in combat will dodge OR attack (I'll get to this soon). It should be obvious how this system breaks down. What if I want to drink water whilst near an item? You can't, you grab the item. You equally might just jump off a cliff by mistake. This happens far too much. I was fighting against the controls the entire time.The core mechanic of Ancestors is evolution. Take a bunch of hairy people, and progress them from sitting in poop to stabbing elephants with a pointy stick. Alright, I'm interested. It's a novel premise that hasn't really been explored before. Immediately this starts out good. New skills are unlocked rapidly early on, and they make a difference. Mobility goes from feeling clunky to (somewhat) fluid. New food options can be adapted to by sucking it up, eating them, and suffering with the ill effects. Learning to walk can be done by forcing yourself to stand up, walking a few steps, then falling over. Keep trying, you'll get it! I loved this. Skills work on a two-tier unlock system: first you have to learn the skill, then you have to pay XP to acquire it. I also enjoyed this as it both captured the spirit of evolution, and mechanically felt great.However, evolution became less cool over time. By the end I was actively resenting it. There's two major problems here. The first: in order to evolve you have to reset the skill tree, but you get to make some skills permanent. The amount you can lock down varies by how many kids you have, and RADIATION FROM METEORITES (yes, literally). Once an upgrade is permanent it's permanent for all future generations. Everything else is lost - you still have the skills available, but you need to pay xp to get them back. This could work in theory, but in practice it's painful. Skills unlock by holding a button for 5-10 seconds, once per skill. The game makes you do this hundreds of times. This was at least an hour of real time. On top of this, there's an RNG mechanic where some babies will generate new permanent skills after evolving. This is why you're forced to reset the skill tree, because you can't unlock much without the special baby skills. This leads to a boring mechanical meta: have 6 kids, pass a generation, repeat, evolve, go back to step 1. Repeat until it feels too gamey, then go stab a rhino or something.The second problem is the world itself. Whilst your own species evolves over time, the simulation does not. It's the same in the first minute as it is in the last. Even weirder - when you pass 'millions of years' during evolution, the simulation doesn't change. It just force-respawns all items and animals, but otherwise continues from the same second. This leads to nonsensical situations, such as my stockpile of raw meat which was still fresh after 6 million years.  This also means evolution serves no purpose. it's viable to survive without unlocking a single skill, and each skill makes the game a little bit easier. Evolution doesn't grant access to new mechanics, nor new areas to explore. It's just evolution for the sake of it, and the more I evolved the more boring the game became. The first few hours were incredible (also terrifying): I didn't understand the world, and everything felt more powerful than me. By the mid-game I ran past everything because I had no reason to engage with it. There's no objective, no story, no narrative, no evolution of challenge. The later areas feel rushed and unfinished, with no reason to explore them.On the subject of locations, oh dear. What happened here? The game starts off in a confusing jungle. It feels claustrophobic, menacing, almost an extinction level threat. But it also offers verticality, plenty of different routes to advance forward, and lots of hiding spaces for nasty snakes to jump out of. Then it becomes an open lake, when the tribe has no swimming ability. Then, as you start to learn how to swim, it changes to large grassy plains and never has swimming again. Then it's a wide open savannah, and finally a wide open desert. There's a few minor changes between these, but that's essentially the layout. The problem here: there's nothing to do in an empty plain! In the jungle you can climb trees, swing from vines, scale rocky cliffs, swim through lakes, and so on. In a wide open plain all you can do is run. This actively took away gameplay options. Whilst it was nice that the map became more open as my species learned how to be bipedal, it also became boring. There was nothing to do except sprint between points of interest for exp.The jungle has snakes and alligators that are terrifying threats early game. The lake/grassy/woodland areas serve no purpose and should have been cut. The open plains has a full menagerie of creatures: snakes, rhinos, elephants, sabre-tooth tigers, jackals etc.  Unfortunately these all have the same AI. They sit around in a pack doing nothing, then attack you if you go near. That's it.The map design is also too formulaic. There's 6-10 'oasis' locations in each biome, and these always have 100% of your tribe's survival needs in them. There's no reason to explore or take risks when there's no reason to leave your oasis. Why become an omnivore when you have infinite edible plants in every oasis? Why migrate when you don't need anything from the savannah? Ancestors could be amazing if they fixed this aspect of it. If the plants didn't respawn you'd have a reason to become an omnivore and fight for food. The game needs some kind of extinction-level threat that forces you to adapt or die, rather than adapt 'because there's no gameplay if you don't'.There's also combat in this game, but dang it's awful. When an enemy attacks the game goes into bullet time, then you have to hold A, and then either point the left stick at the enemy to attack or away from them to dodge. That's it. Congratulations, you now know how to beat every creature in the game without exception. You might lose if you don't have a pointy stick, but you will always win if you do. To make up for it, all sticks break after exactly one use. This system sucks. When you attack you get a cool cinematic cutscene, and these are visceral as heck. You'll stab a creature in the gut, jump on its back, then pummel it in the head with your fists until it dies. This is awesome! I just wish it was me pulling it off, and not a scripted cutscene triggered by me pressing A once.There's a few more mechanics to the game, but this review is hitting the character limi;Recommended;38.2;30/08/2020;1,104;74
Private Division;Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 149,90;UPDATE: Now that I've beat the game, I still recommend the game with a caveat. the game is still very repetitive up until the end and meaningful progress is very wide spread. Get meteorites asap, and you only need about 70-80% evolution progress to complete the game.Play with full hud and full tutorial your first time through, it's actually mind-blowing how many reviews that are not recommending the game say the game doesn't tell you how to do things when it gives you a full tutorial card you need to manually dismiss. Just a few examples of things I know for SURE had a tutorial or makes sense:-"For example I was asked to make a sleeping place... but crafting had not been explained to me." This has a tutorial, and not only that but it kind of makes sense you'd pile up a bunch of leaves.- "Almost every activity in the game is a sort of sound based QTE deal..." Most QTE's rely on the borders of the screen getting a rainbow effect and if you're playing on gamepad you also get a vibration most of the time.-"...but with fighting I have no idea what to press and when, and the game doesn't bother to tell you anything."  The game literally has two separate tutorial cards telling you that to dodge you hold A while moving away and release at the right time and that counter attacking is the same except you move toward the attacker.-"My first ape almost died of exhaustion as he didn’t know how to sleep... " At no point do you need to inspect to learn to sleep, you just do it at your bed. You can also hold A to lie down anywhere with an empty hand and sleep on the spot.-" I managed a few more objectives, groomed a mate, but had no idea how to make a baby. My instinct told me we had to copulate, but, apparently, these animals don’t know how to do that..." This one doesn't have a tutorial, but it's fairly obvious you need to go to a resting spot (aka a bed) and experiment, finding out that you need to call your mate. -"I wasn’t planning on watching endless youtubes just to figure out where to go and how to solve what." 10+ hours in and haven't looked up a tutorial yet, personally.I will agree though, that this game is very repetitive and people will find the controls clunky (personally I got the hang of them pretty quickly, a lot of your context actions depend on you either moving, standing, having your dominant hand free or both hands free) and there isn't enough variety. There will be one or two new animals per biome the further you go, and there's a good amount of redundant items (fruits) and the crafting is still rudimentary where I am in the game. The core gameplay loop makes itself very obvious very quickly so you need to really enjoy exploring the environment itself.However, I've never played another game like this before, where you need to learn EVERY system from the ground up by experimenting and learning. It truly gives you that feeling of being a monke in the forest, afraid of everything but slowly evolving similarly to our ancestors.I'm going to spoil the gameplay loop for you guys, if you're still confused:-Have as many babies as you can (I seem to keep capping out at 6)-After your female apes are infertile, play as them because they can't procreate anymore-Saddle up with two babies-Explore your area, discover landmarks (diamond shaped markers)-Level up enough to take advantage of all your reinforcements-Repeat all steps until you need to go further from your settlement to discover stuff, at this point move your clan to a new oasis-When you complete a bunch of feats in your evolution tab, evolve your species. This is the true goal of the game, catching up to the modern era, and every feat you do (discovering areas, fighting animals, discovering things, etc.) gives you bonus years that moves you further down the timeline. Evolving also cements your mutations that babies provide after they make it to adulthood/ elder status.The WHOLE point of the game is that you're supposed to figure everything out from the ground up, experimenting with every little thing like a dumb ape. If there was a tutorial and index for every little thing possible then it'd defeat the purpose.;Recommended;31.5;31/01/2021;264;1
Private Division;Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 149,90;This game is the perfect example of an interesting concept being executed with thought and care. resulting in an incredibly unique adventure experience.Is this a game for everyone? No, it is not. However, if you enjoy games that involve exploration, experimentation and logical puzzle solving. You will definitely enjoy this game.The core of Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is that you are starting as our earliest ancestors and exploring, experimenting and evolving over millions of years until you eventually become the earliest relatives of HomoSapiens. The game doesn't hold your hand, you are responsible for learning the various actions and interactions with the world and the objects in it. The game thrusts you into the same mindset of our early ancestors. You want to make a sharpened stick? Well, you are going to need to figure out the interactions required to do it. But you aren't done there, as you get more comfortable experimenting with interactions, you may find ways to refine the process and in doing so you will unlock the neuronal potential of your chimps. Essentially you are growing alongside your chimps. as you figure out more about the game and its processes your chimps evolve and adapt more and more to their environment and move ever closer to becoming early humans.Visually the game is beautiful. Never once did I get bored exploring the massive game world presented to me. Many times I was actually awe struck by the beauty and immensity of it. I still remember when I was out exploring trying to find a better settlement for my clan and crested the top of a rock formation to be greeted with the sight of the Savannah sprawling out before me. I remember excitedly making may way down to try and explore this new biome, only to have to retreat battered, bruised, and bloody because my chimps were ill adapted to this new environment. I also remember the immense satisfaction I felt when I evolved my chimps to better handle this new challenge, then returned in force with my clan to claim our new home.Overall, this game has become one of my most memorable gaming experiences. I loved every second of the 70 hours I put into it. Is it perfect? No, there are some bugs and there is some jankiness here and there. Sometimes trying to figure out how to trigger a particular evolutionary path can be frustrating but with the exception of one (I won't name it for spoiler reasons), they were usually intuitive and left me face-palming when I finally figured out what I needed to do.If you want to experience an epic and immersive adventure that is tied directly to our own heritage, I HIGHLY recommend this game.EDIT: One thing that I guess needs to be added is that if you are the type that can't stand playing a PC game with a controller, then don't bother. This game requires a controller for maximum enjoyment.;Recommended;70.3;14/12/2020;224;4

Private Division;Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 149,90;This game frustrates me to no end. On the other hand, I absolutely love the movement dynamics, the evolution system, the world itself and exploring, and the overall underlying concept, yet at the same time, the game has such clear flaws and missing elements that playing it just makes me sad for what it could have been.The most glaring of these flaws is the total lack of proper outside pressures on your tribe, be it from scarcity of resources, actually dangerous predators, and most importantly OTHER tribes of apes. As it stands, there is basically zero reason to ever go out of the jungles and explore the map outside of sheer curiosity of the player and the banal desire to "just finish the game", which in itself isn't exactly fun because the game never ups the challenge the gameworld presents to the player, nor do the base gameplay mechanics ever really expand, or interact with one another in any interesting way. For example, you can't place food to attract prey animals to a location where you could trap them or hunt them more easily.However ,it is the lack of other ape tribes is something I am utterly baffled by, and have yet to find any explanation to why the devs decided to make your ape tribe the sole monkeys in the game. Territory disputes between apes is a big part of their behavior, as was most likely the same case for our ancestors, and the lack of them just makes the game world feel utterly empty. Having to deal with other tribes would have opened up a whole new element of gameplay to the game, which in my opinion, would have improved this game tremendously.All in all, the above flaws basically mean that once you have figured out the intentionally obscure ways of how the game mechanics work (and unlocked the few that are behind evolution leaps), the whole gameworld becomes your oyster and you face basically zero challenges from the game which ends up making the whole experience dull.In short, this game could have been a masterpiece, and it has a good idea at it's core, but for some reason the devs failed to implement vital elements that would make the game actually engaging to play in the long term.Thanks for reading my blog.;Recommended;79.9;2/09/2020;188;1
Private Division;Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 149,90;This game is a radically new way of telling the oldest story. My biggest gripe is that nobody told me it's intentional to not have a clue how to play. The game is designed to make you learn just like an ape from 10 million years ago. You're taught how to walk and climb, and that's about it. Everything else is banging your controller (which is nearly required) against your desk like an ape with two rocks. You're supposed to struggle and be confused and die, because damn Nature, you scary. There are plenty of resources to help you learn how to play and what to do, but for the full experience, avoid these and learn on your own how to fix the burning bite from the wiggly hissing meat tube.;Recommended;2.1;2/11/2020;269;45
Private Division;Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 149,90;This is not a game for the impatient, those who just want to get straight into the action or those who need clear goals and direction. It takes many hours to truly get a feel for and at first, it is extremely difficult - you and your tribe are a bit useless, you are a prey animal and everything will try to kill, injure or envenomate you. The last part doesn't change throughout the entire game, but as you unlock neurons and evolve, you will become far better at defence, attack, resource gathering, senses, production, social ties and more efficient with energy expenditure, so it becomes far less fraught.I cannot stress enough that this will take time - many, many hours. If you do not like games that are slow paced with occasional (you hope) moments of life or death panic, this is not the game for you. If you do not like games that are repetitive (and I admit tediously so sometimes) and based on survival (you have to eat, sleep, drink and not over-stress yourself just like reality), do not bother. If you are looking for a game that will guide and tell you what to do, it is not worth your money. Also the save system, while I understand the idea behind it, is not very practical for real life. You can only save on a sleep spot, so if you have a time limit on your gaming you have to plan to be back at your base so you can do so.If you *are* interested in the theme of the game and are willing to put in the time and push through the setbacks and challenges you will face, however, it's definitely worth a buy. The map is enormous, there's tonnes to explore and sometimes you just have to stop and marvel at the scenery (and hope nothing is stalking you as you do so). Personally I *love* the freedom of it all. I don't like games that try to shoehorn me down a particular path, I like being given the stage and left to do as I wish - this game is perfect for that. Once you've mastered combat and dodging you'll pretty much never die unless you run your ape into the ground or misjudge a jump, but the feeling of being alone at night and suddenly knowing there's a threat around still manages to give chills even now.I certainly hope for a follow up or two to this game.;Recommended;475.3;1/05/2021;140;N/I

Private Division;OlliOlli World;Action, Indie, Sports;R$ 83,07;I can't thank my friend enough for introducing me to this game. It's the kind of game you can enjoy with quick, fun 10-minute sessions, or you can get completely lost in it for hours.I absolutely love this game. It brings together everything I enjoy – awesome music, stunning landscapes, and meticulously designed skateboarding areas, characters, and world. There's also a cool side skateboarding element with increasingly challenging levels that are super satisfying to conquer. You might find yourself going back to certain levels over and over, either to beat them or to score more points and compete with friends.Officially, it's a relatively short game, taking about 5 hours to finish on a PC. But for me, it often takes longer because I'm not great at games that need precise timing. So, you might be wondering, "Is it worth getting?" I wholeheartedly say yes. It offers a fantastic and motivating gaming experience, even in 2D. You'll get totally immersed, with 50 levels to complete, over 100 tricks and grinds to master, and a whopping 200+ challenges. There are also fun modes like Spot Mode and Daily Grind.What I find most exciting about this game is how cleverly the levels are designed. The ability to skate on different surfaces adds a cool twist to the gameplay. I have to mention the unique levels where you race against a bear, both of you sliding on floating objects across the water to reach the finish line.Just a heads up, though, this game only works with controllers – keyboard support isn't available. Once you get the hang of the controls, they feel natural. Just be careful not to leave the game alone for too long. I found out the hard way that an accidental press of the "Y" button can restart a level instead of moving forward.;Recommended;15.7;17/12/2022;34;2

Unfortunately, I just can't recommend the game because the developers have abandoned it despite highly reported and simple bugs. The game plays well, but once you complete an area, the additional challenges and unlocks cannot be completed. That is, the challenges can be done, but will not count toward completionist unlocks. So you get the satisfaction of completion, but not any rewards. And in the devs words, they "have no plans on releasing any new versions". Just check the steam discussion pages.TLDR. Great game, disappointing developer support that should not be encouraged with your purchase.;Not Recommended;94.3;24/04/2023;39;1

Private Division;OlliOlli World;Action, Indie, Sports;R$ 83,07;First off, the game is fantastic. I recommend it to anyone that is interested, provided they can deal with the caveats I'm going to mention.The game has a great pastel artstyle that is always a pleasure to look at and focuses on readability in levels above all else, and does it well. It has a good soundtrack and radio that you can change at any time. the characters are charming, but the dialogue parts can get old pretty fast. luckily It's super easy to skip them and it has cheeky little dialogue buttons for the skips too, which are generally pretty funny,The gameplay is amazing, and the way they give you a full moveset at the very beginning while explaining it sporadically throughout the game to not overwhelm you is done very well. I 100% the first three worlds while playing because they were so much fun. There is an interesting thing that clips the games wings a bit though. so, there are 5 worlds that you progress through, and four out of five of them are absolutely amazing. but the fourth one, sketchside, is dreadful. up until this point the worlds have all had fun levels, neat challenges that occasionally gave me some trouble but not too much, and they've all had a theme/gimmick that they focus on. sketchside doesn't do this. sketchside hates you.The difficulty spike is absolutely crazy. the world isn't just hard though, It's kind of just overall bad. not really a fun time through any of it, aside from maybe two levels. the world right after it, the last one, is about the same level of difficulty but stays incredibly fun for most of the levels. sketchside is BAD. sketchside is so bad that from what I can tell from people online and stats from steam a lot of people completely give up on the game there, or do what I did and start just blasting through it without a care for challenges or score or anything. It completely ruins their time with the last world too it seems, cause it kind of sours the experience. The game is still absolutely amazing though. the main reason I talk so much about sketchside is because I want anyone that reads this to go in with the expectation that it sucks, because without prior knowledge it really hits you in the face.Really though, the game is worth a purchase for the first three worlds alone. if you get to sketchside and give up it was still plenty of content for the price and a wonderfully unique experience. the last world is really good though, so I recommend trying to get through it.;Recommended;31.6;29/07/2023;21;1

Deep Silver;Metro Exodus;Action;R$ 149,00;I am 72 yrs old and I do not get too excited about games that much but this one was special. I found this game fascinating. Different style of play than FO3 or FO4, which up until now I used as a standard for playing games. I did not care for Metro 2033 so I did not pay much attn to these games. A friend said try it so I did and boy am I happy about that. Talk about a game you can put yourself into and become fully immersed, this is it and the artwork and graphics were incredible. Some things I did not care for but the good so far outweighs the bad it is not worth mentioning the bad. VERY NICELY DONE. I am keeping this installed and will play it again when I finish some others. (EDIT) I stated I did not care much for Metro 2033, I was wrong. I am playing the redux now and love it. Someone said to read the books, as soon as I am finished playing 2033, Last Light and Exodus in the proper order this time, I am going to do just that.I just completed the series in the proper order, playing Exodus for the second time. I found it this time around even more magnificent than I did the first. I have experienced MANY thing in my many years so there is not a lot that will get to me.

Deep Silver;Metro Exodus;Action;R$ 149,00;OverviewMetro Exodus is the third installment of the acclaimed series, inspired to the books of Dmitry Glukhovsky, and set after the events of Metro last Light. Once again impersonating Artyom, players will soon leave the cryptic tunnels of the Moscow Metro to journey on through the entirety of Russia, ending up in a variety of places ranging from deserts to lush forests - accompanied by Colonel Miller and his elite Spartan team. What initially begins as a daring escape soon turns out to be a journey for survival, as unexpected turns of events one after another come crashing down on the squad.🟩 ProsIncredible visuals with excellent art direction.Realistic, satisfying and unforgiving combat system on higher difficulties.Meaningful exploration with many secondary locations.Excellent narrative and character building.Overall good variety of content, situations, enemies and tools. 🟥 ConsKarma system, which determines the ending, was reworked in a bad way.In Ranger Hardcore mode, Autosave frequency is inconsistent and can lead to significant progress loss.Rating: ExcellentClick here for the complete Rating Charthttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2138850199Starting with the good points, the strongest feature of Exodus as it was with the prequels, is the atmosphere and world-building, which deliver an uncompromisingly realistic take on the nuclear post-apocalypse. This time it's not confined to the cramped Metro tunnels, but shows in full the entirety of Russia's wastelands, and does so flawlessly. Fighting any kind of enemy on the higher difficulties is a tense and unforgiving affair, where all but the weakest attacks mean certain death for both yourself and most enemies. This realism is complemented by accurate gunplay and good variety of murder tools to use. Exploring the wastelands is not only spectacular but also worthwhile, as every map contains a bounty of secondary locations often hiding unique upgrades for Artyom's suit and weapon mods. They will make your life easier once acquired. The narrative and characters stay true to the excellent book series and do not disappoint in the slightest.There are however a few dents to an otherwise flawless execution. The Karma system has been reworked and forces players to take on the majority of situations with complete stealth, without also killing anyone in order to get the good ending. This goes as far as penalizing you for killing someone that shot first and is openly hostile, while the consequences will influence your companions' very lives as if some "higher power" was there to punish you - which makes no sense. Overall, Metro Exodus remains an excellent open-world FPS that delivers the quality already made famous from the previous chapters, at the same time enhances the gameplay in new ways bringing it to a new level that surpasses the previous ones in almost every department. It took me around 25 hours to finish the game on Ranger Hardcore, while exploring thoroughly every map and completing all side content. For the price of 40€ and excellent quality, I can recommend buying at full price.Liked this review, and want to see more of the same quality?

Ziplines and boats are also used sparingly to traverse otherwise impossible paths. While exploring, keeping an eye out for mechanical and chemical components - both used in crafting - is one of the primary goals, as you'll need them to craft supplies. Of course you can also find already made ammo, medkits and filters, but that's a more rare occurrence. Certain specific places hold unique modifications more or less hidden, and this is what makes exploring every corner worthwhile. A global map will display your position and all the discovered points of interest, highlighted on the map by using the Binoculars on a high place. Safehouses are sparingly set around the world and they can offer a safe refuge to wait night or day, craft at the workbench and more importantly save the game if you play Hardcore. There is no fast travel.Character ManagementCan be done on the fly with the portable workshop in your backpack, or in a more complete manner at a stationary workbench in a Safehouse. You will be able to modify any of your weapons with previously acquired mods at any time, as well craft simple ammo types such as arrows or steel balls, medkits and filters. More complex crafting requires a full bench and that includes changing your suit upgrades, crafting bullets and as well throwables like grenades, cleaning weapons to prevent malfunction.QuestsAre not numerous in the game and usually are about retrieving a specific item for one of your travel companions or another character. They do not always award anything other than achievements or Karma, but still they are worth doing for the sake of storyline and to explore new places.CombatIs one of the most consistent elements of the experience and at least on the higher difficulties, is a brutal and unforgiving affair where even just one shot can instantly kill you, as well as enemies. Ammunition is fairly limited, while grenades and throwables are powerful bit very expensive to create - using all your resources, stealth as well, is key to prevail against overwhelming numbers. Nothing prevents you from going in guns blazing but on higher difficulties it's a good idea to take out at least some enemies silently before doing so. Foes range from your average bandit with a shotgun to nine feet tall abominations with the strength of twenty men, passing from mutated shrimps and venomous giant worms. Each foe has strengths and weaknesses for you to exploit, for example most animals will be scared by fire or your vehicle. Human enemies are definitely smart and use tactics such as flaking, cover and grenades to overpower you, other than having swift reflexes and excellent aim - on Hardcore at least. Being accurate, fast and conservative are the pillars of Metro's combat.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2140378652TechnicalPC Specs: RTX2080Ti, Ryzen 3900X, 32GB RAM DDR4Critical Problems: None.Optimization: Resource usage is within expected parameters for the quality, no problems to report.Performance: The game runs without issues in 1440p, 85Hz on Ultra settings. Bugs: Key rebinds do not work properly for certain keyboard configurations.Other issues: Save system on Hardcore difficulty has frequency issues, might be a bug, unconfirmed.Final ThoughtsMetro Exodus is definitely a worthy successor that expands the prequels' gameplay, taking it to new heights, but not without some drawbacks. Fans of the series and those who like atmospheric games will not be disappointed.;Recommended;29.7;25/06/2020;842;31
Deep Silver;Metro Exodus;Action;R$ 149,00;As i grow older, i tend to lose motivation to play games since alot of them aren't even fun anymore and i usually have to force myself to play them. But THIS game is an absolute must play, i absolutely loved every second of it. Some people may be scared off because of the change from linear gameplay to a more open-world type gameplay unlike it's predecessors. But i think they executed this change of pace perfectly.The gameplay is basically the same as the previous games, they added a cool crafting system (that somehow magically turns some random chemicals and metal into gas mask filters and ammo). Your guns can get jammed if you don't clean them often and you have to manually unjam them, sand, snow, and even falling in water affects how fast your gun gets dirty. Your gas mask can get damaged too, and if it cracks you can repair it with duck tape (it's only temporary though), and unlike the previous games you can't pick up a new mask, you will have to repair this one at a workbench.The morality system makes a comeback, but there's not alot of moral points to be earned in each chapter, most of it is straight forward unlike the previous games (also as a tip, listening to dialogues won't give you morality points, but it can give you sidequests and cool marks on the map).The locations are really cool, there's a chapter for each season of the year, and you get to experience quite some interesting landscapes, ranging from snowy landscapes to desert places. I'd say the first chapter (The Volga) is probably the Highlight of the game, but that does NOT mean the other chapters are boring.I haven't encountered any major bugs, most of the bugs i've encountered were physic bugs, and those were extremely rare, there are some game breaking softlock bugs supposedly, so make sure to back up your saves as you progress (i made a special folder where i kept all my saves from the beginning of the game to the end)The best aspect of the game for me is probably how immersive it is, i haven't been immersed in a game like this in a really long time, in my opinion, i'd say it even takes the spotlight away from the first game.And it's not only the "horror" elements of immersion, it's the family and friends aspect as well, drinking and playing the guitar with your friends on the train was one of the most real scenes i've ever seen in a video game, and i am so glad that a video game could capture that beautiful feeling.Okay i'm getting quite stupidly philosophical there, to wrap it up, this game is AMAZING. It absolutely blew my mind, i thought it would kinda disappoint me after the first two amazing games, but it's quite the contrary. I think this is my favourite metro game, and i absolutely recommend it even at full price.P.S. I highly recommend playing this game on the Ranger Hardcore difficulty as with all the metro games, not only does it help you immerse better, but i think it's the best way to experience this masterpiece of a game.R.I.P.

Deep Silver;Metro Exodus;Action;R$ 149,00;At first glance, Metro: Exodus (MEx) might seem like a typical FPS with a couple of twists, and while it doesn’t really offer anything groundbreaking, it is a perfect example of a whole package being greater than the sum of its parts.Pros: Excellent player immersion Bleak yet beautiful and incredibly atmospheric world Exploration and discovery feel amazing thanks to almost no hand-holding Although completely optional for the most part, player progression is meaningful and noticeable Enjoyable and believable story with tons of optional dialogue to listen to Pacing makes the game feel fresh from beginning to the endCons: Certain parts, even though very few, are simply not balanced for the highest difficulty Sprinting on uneven surfaces can make you slide, fall or slingshot off of terrain and even die NG+ is buggy and doesn’t transfer weapon upgradesBefore the review, a suggestionUnless you want yet another FPS with some extended features, you should most definitely play this game on Ranger Hardcore with Minimal Interface option. Having played through the game twice, I decided to try Normal and, let me tell you straight away that this is most definitely not the way you should experience MEx.Not only is the game too forgiving but the immersion, survival, and scavenging, which makes it stand out in the oversaturated FPS crowd, become basically non-existing. Just imagine if Dark Souls had Skyrim’s quest pointer.If you’re uncomfortable with a very challenging setting, pick the one that you’re OK with and go a step above in order to maintain the pressure and the idea of a harsh and unforgiving post-nuclear world. I’ve heard someone saying how “Metro is at its best when you’re at your worst”, and I could not agree more. With that being said, let’s dig in, shall we?Lose Yourself in the Post-Nuclear RussiaThe Franchise previously known for its predominantly claustrophobic and linear levels becomes very open-ended in its latest iteration. From this, it’s easy to assume that there are going to be some big changes, and, I for one, welcome and absolutely loved those. Thematically, this is still a Metro game. There are even a number of linear sections and levels, such as the game’s opening, where you have to play as it is intended and have little to no say so in how things develop. Gameplay-wise, the foundation is there, just that it has been expanded and improved upon, but the overall feel was quite different for me. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2449782394Being dubbed the best scout in the unit, Artyom, the game’s protagonist, has a lot to live up to, and MEx provides plenty of opportunities to do just that. Wandering the outskirts and the wilderness, scouting for points of interest and noting them down on your map for later exploration is a very important and big part of the experience. In fact, depending on your playstyle, scouting, exploration, and scavenging might as well be the major part of your MEx playthrough, and this is actually pretty cool.Now let’s add a high level of immersion to this. I’m talking about no HUD. This means no objective tracker on your screen, or a mini-map full of colorful icons to pop. No distraction whatsoever while exploring. You go where you think that something of interest might be. Of course, you can still access the map and check the objective tracker. You have your visibility indicator for stealth and the Geiger counter as well as many other indicators. The thing is, they’re presented in a very immersive way. They’re all gadgets, mostly on your wrist, audio and visual cues which are a part of the game world, and when you see or hear those, nothing is reminding you that while all of this is cool, you’re still playing a video game.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2492005889Progression and PacingEven though MEx puts you on an open level, it is still not an open-world game. In fact, these open areas are big levels that, once you’re done with, you may never return to. This is why you might want to let your FOMO take over and take your time to make sure you’ve visited every nook and cranny. Why? Because this is how you progress, for the most part. The game will not explicitly make it clear that you’re about to move out so pay attention to what your comrades are saying!You don’t exactly level up in MEx. There are no perks to unlock or XP to grind. However, there are still ways to improve your character, like gadgets, suit upgrades, and weapon parts. Finding new weapon parts is a big deal, as the game lets you customize guns in the field. Considering various enemy types, different weather conditions and the impact that the time of the day has on the world of MEx, this is quite useful. Need a medium-range rifle instead of a silenced pistol? Strip down your revolver, and make a couple of adjustments! Swap the silencer for a long barrel, add the 2X Scope on it's rail, and you've got yourself a rifle. If you've searched thoroughly, you will have everything you need, and can improvise to adapt to any given situation. Once obtained, these upgrades can be used through the entire game.Others are given to you as the story progresses. You might actually want to stick to the main objective until you’ve obtained the binoculars, at which point you’ll be properly equipped and have everything you need to explore the world on your own.Story Progression and Player DecisionsWhen it comes to the story, perhaps more than the content of it, I like the fact that it’s rather believable. Listening to the Artyom’s comrades speak about what was going on is what I enjoyed the most, as they were all lovable characters with a lot of personality.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2492092923The adventures of Aurora’s crew and their objectives feel like they are happening spontaneously. They were logical conclusions and decisions based on the current events and situation that I never found to be forced on the game simply because the developers needed some excuse to blow things up or shoot someone.  Player choices and their consequences, which the game always had (to an extent), are done better and more clearly telegraphed to the player this time around, although there’s still room for some improvement.  The exploration, which I’ve brought up so many times already, also extends to the story as some story-related things require to be found first. It is also the best way to gain additional Karma points which will determine how the story unfolds and eventually ends.  To wrap it up...Of course, I am recommending this game. I’ve played it multiple times and actually plan to give the recently released raytracing-only version a go sometime down the road.  However, keep in mind what I’ve said at the beginning: unless you make this game unforgiving, you’ll be mowing down enemies and playing a post-apocalyptic shooter, which is not really that impressive nowadays anymore.  My impressions are based on the very specific Ranger Hardcore mode with Minimal Interface. This made the game slow, methodical and unforgiving, which is something that I very much enjoy. Ammo was scarce, just like the resources, I had to make every bullet count, and when I made a mistake, it was punished severely. At times it reminded me of the good times when I played Metal Gear Solid 3 back in the day on my PS2. When I scoured around for resources and ammo, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. MEx is, in many ways, just like that, and if this sounds like something you’d like to experience, then, by all means, get it, play it, and love it.;Recommended;67.9;19/05/2021;252;1

Deep Silver;Metro Exodus;Action;R$ 149,00;This is one of the few series of games I have ever played where the next installment is better than the last. Normally, this is not the case, but Metro is a no ordinary game. The story really makes you feel a part of Artyom's family. Over the course of the series you bond with Artyom's mates in a way that feels closer than family. You care about everyone's well being and you want to play through the story to make sure everyone remains safe. Not only that, but the development of each and every individual character is wonderful. There's a lot of depth to them and you hear it in random conversations when you stumble upon them or smoke with them on the train ride. Hearing every word that everyone has to say any time really does mean a lot. The Soundtrack. I can not justify verbally how incredible the soundtrack is for this game. The emotion, the feeling, the atmosphere, the intensity is something that sounds like it was composed by a supernatural deity who knew music better than any human composer. The soundtrack perfectly harmonizes with the atmosphere of the game and setting that you find yourself in.I honestly cannot get enough of this series.

Deep Silver;Dead Island Riptide;Action;None;What is Riptide?Riptide was a stand-alone expansion to Dead Island back in 2013. Releasing such content was already a rarity at that time. you usually make do with DLCs where your best bet is to purchase the corresponding Season Pass instead of individual contents. So, releasing an expansion to an already well-known game seems a pretty cool idea. The story takes place immediately after Dead Island - from Banoi we switch to Palanai, another tourist resort-like location which is taken over by our undead friends. Anything new?Yes and no. Yes, as there are some new things in terms of game mechanics but no as they do not significantly alter the gameplay experience. Again, this is an expansion pack so do not expect a completely overhauled and reworked system.  A new addition to the group is John, a 5th member, who is mainly specialised in using brass knuckles. This was the only weapon type left out - we finally have a hero who's expert at hand-to-hand combat.Another thing is the introduction of survival sections. As our heroes move from one place to another every time just before they begin their journey we are to make a stand. The top of the screen indicates the strength of the horde - naturally, this is decreasing slowly as the zombies are attacking in waves. We can lay traps and put up fences at the beginning and between waves. Using gatling guns to riddle the living dead with bullets is pure fun in these sections.We also have some new zombie types such as the drowner that quickly wakes up (he is floating on the water appearing to be dead) and attacks you. He is not much of a threat but if you do not pay attention you are in for a nasty surprise. Drowners mean a lot of water - prepare to use not just automobiles but also a motorboat to explore the new island's remote locations. My favourite was the screamer - an old lady whose brain is visible and who is able to emit such a loud scream that your hero starts wandering about while trying to endure the loud noise. There are also some bungalow and apartment areas that are full of zombies and they include bosses - expect a difficult fight but usually great reward at the end.Why is it Definitive?Because it was re-released a couple of years later along with its predecessor. The "normal" versions are not available anymore just the remastered editions. Basically, the game was redone with the use of a later Chrome Engine (the same that ran under Dying Light). It is a nice touch as the game looks much, much better (especially the shadows and some of the lights) but then again you have the same gameplay and some of the annoying bugs or glitches remained.Who is this game for?It is for zombie game fans. Techland's real big hit was definitely Dying Light with its parkour mechanics but if you want to see where the zombie fest started for them feel free to purchase Dead Island and its expansion. Hours of fun are guaranteed!;Recommended;36.5;13/09/2018;87;1

Deep Silver;Dead Island Riptide;Action;None;Dead Island: Riptide  The second entry in the  Dead Island  game series. Not a prequel, and not quite a sequel. So is this game worth the buy? Let's get into it.   The Good    The Setting - The Dead Island game's call to fame is its beautiful setting. "Its zombies.... But on a tropical island" was probably the birthing idea for this game series. All jokes aside, Riptide stays true to its predecessor and lets you explore through the scenic island "paradise", the flooded jungles, and eventually the urban hellscape that is the city of Hederson. When optimized correctly, these can all be intriguing and visually appealing scenes.  The Nostalgia - If you're playing  Dead Island: Riptide , there a chance that you played  Dead Island  as well. Riptide knows this and does a decent job of bringing a little joy in from the past with continued references, Easter eggs, and continuations from the previous game. Its always nice to get a little blast from the past.   The Playable Characters - Some may say that playing as the same characters through multiple games is unoriginal and lame. I disagree, for me it helps continue their story. In Riptide, you get have five options this time around. Your choices are:Sam B - Rapper who beats things to deathLogan - Professional Football player who throws things at other things until they diePurna - Security who shoots things to death Xian Mei - Receptionist and ex-military who stabs things to deathJohn - Australian soldier who punches and kicks things to death- Essentially, you can carry over your save from the first Dead Island as whatever character, or choose to play as John, the new character to the story. Never a bad thing to spice it up a little  The Bad     The Story - Now... the first Dead Island didn't exactly have the  best  story around, but it at least was original for the series (because it was the first game.... duh). Riptide, though, decided to be brave! To be bold! Brazen even! They do this by..... Having basically the same story as the first game? "No, that can't be right." *checks notes*. "They get stranded on an island deserted with zombies, check". "Then, they have to head further into the Jungle, check". "After that, they have to head through the sewers or tunnels... to get to the large city nearby... Oh". ITS LITERALLY THE SAME STORY. LIKE THE FIRST GAME ENDS, AND THEN YOU GET SENT THROUGH THE SAME EXACT THING. It's crazy man... and kind of lame.  The Enemies  - Its okay to have use the same enemies from the previous games, even in zombie games. Look at Left 4 Dead. But they at least polished how they act, and added multiple new zombies. From what I could see, there was literally only one new zombie in this game. Every other enemy was just copy pasted from the first game. Speaking of copy pasting ....  The Graphics and Detail - There are like... no improvements in this game. It looks entirely the same. All models (zombies, characters, weapons, etc.) are the same as the first game. This isn't a big issue to me personally, but its part of a larger problem I will address later.   The weapons and Fighting - Multiple issues here. First, there has been practically no improvement from the first game. The melee attacks are still glitchy and clanky like in the first game. Second, all the weapon upgrades and improvements are basically the same. Yeah, there's fire, shock, bleed, and poison options, but there will be like, eight of them, and they all do, and look the same. It honestly feels kind of lazy. Third, the combat does not always register. You see a katana slice through a walker, but it doesn't hit or damage them. Inconvenient for a small fight, deadly for a major one. Throwing weapons clip through the map, making you lose rare and upgraded gear because it shot through a cliff.  The Clipping and NavMeshing - You get stuck on everything in this game. You'll be running down a street being chased by a butcher and 10 infected, and your foot will clip onto the edge of a small trash can, and now you've completely stopped moving and are now dead. You will clip through ledges making you fall to your death. I've even fell through the map once while walking through the jungle.   The Ugly    The Preformance - Before getting started, no it is not my internet. No it is not my brand new gaming pc. No it is not a problem on my end. Look in any forum or comment string for this game and you see it to. This game... preforms  HORRIBLY . The title screen is sluggish, the actual game is horribly laggy and feels like it can barely run. Its bad enough that you could even get a headache over it. I don't understand what they did wrong, as the original  Dead Island  from years earlier, runs perfectly. Smooth as butter. This game is clanky and rough.  The Lack of Originality - This game is not a sequel. It is barely different from the first game, which I believe to be vastly superior. The combat is no different. The story is no different. The setting is barely different, you just moved over a couple islands. The game just does not in any way feel like a separate entity. It honestly fails to uphold the same standards set by the first  Dead Island   Overall   Dead Island: Riptide is a DLC that pretends to be a real game. It is completely unoriginal and fails to differ from its predecessor in any way, even the PLOT OF THE STORY. It fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table and doesn't excel in any form. It performs worse, looks no better, and plays significantly worse that the first game. The fact that they charged $60 dollars for this should be a crime. They should of just released this as an add-on DLC for Dead Island , charged you $30 and called it a day.  At least if they did that, me and thousands of others wouldn't feel ripped offDisclaimer: This game IS entertaining. You will have fun playing this. Its just that its not worth the full price as there is barely anything new. Just pick it up on sale if you want to try it;Not Recommended;16.2;27/06/2020;97;7
Deep Silver;Dead Island Riptide;Action;None;Dead Island: Riptide following the events of the previous Dead Island game, where you basically get stranded on another tropical island again with zombies on it and you have to get out out of there.Comparing to the previous game, there is a new type of mission, which are group requests. Basically in the game you have a group of survivors, who you can take care of their needs and if you complete them, you upgrade their weapons and wares too. It's not really an in-depth group managing stuff, but it's a great way to level up and making the shop prices lower. I think RIptide is more balanced than it's predecessor. Weapons doing more damage and have better durability overall, skill trees seems more useful too, however enemies still able to take you out easily, if you don't know the best way to eliminate them. There were base defense gameplay parts in the game, where you had to fight against a zombie horde and survive the attack, also protecting your group members, which were all right in general. You can miss it easily, but the soundtrack for Riptide is also better than the original Dead Island one. However you might ask, why I keep comparing Riptide to the previous Dead Island game? I could just review it standalone. Well, that's because both game is basically the same in most parts. In Riptide, you collect different weapons and upgrade them throughout the game, meanwhile you also upgrade yourself and completing missions in an infected filled environment. You can use skills, passives and different type of weapons and mods to uncover more about the situation. That's basically the formula for the original Dead Island.If you except something new from the series, you will be disappointed. For me, this game just felt like an expansion. Missions are not so different from each other, they feel blend, however at the end of the game it will start overtwisting some simple looking missions and even the lore itself for no reason at all, which felt annoying to me. The story is pretty weird, thanks to the silly decisions which the characters make throughout the game and to the horrific characters, but at least they tried to make the story a bit interesting in the end. There are more bugs in this one, then the original game. I got pushed into a wall and died instantly a lot more than anything, I also got stuck on certain places, the boat in the game is horrible and jumping over boxes or just doing simple platforming is nerve wrecking and the list goes on. Explosion radius is also unpredictable.This game came out 1 and half years after the original Dead Island and I can't really understand why they didn't tried to bring more new stuff to it, however somehow I like this game more then the previous one, even with it's issues. If you want to know more about the Dead Island series or you are just interested in the game, even though you read it's issues, than I can recommend the game for your. I had all right times with it, but 20€ is a lot for it, 7-5€ is okay for it.;Recommended;14.4;12/02/2023;35;1

Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;This is a long review, so just read the bottom paragraph for a simple summary of my thoughts.It surprises me that the general consensus for this game is worse than Risen 2: Dark Waters. To be fair, if you hated Risen 2, there likely are not enough redeeming factors about the end of the trilogy to be worth your while. But nevertheless, some substantial improvements to the overall experience have made this a promising step in the right direction for Piranha Bytes as a developer.Risen 2: Dark Waters was ultimately a failure as an open world, engrossing RPG. It was extremely shallow, overall having one of their smallest and most lackluster world designs to date, with most of the islands consisting of winding pathways with few interesting landmarks leading between major locations. These locations were greatly devoid of life, as the characters were as dull and two-dimensional as wooden boards. The combat wasn't the worst I've ever seen in a game, but it took forever to get the necessary skills to stay on top of combat, and by then you just got used to button mashing between prayers. Beyond combat, half the skills in the game were worthless or used in only scripted situations that were easy enough to do without.At first glance, or maybe even for the first couple hours, Risen 3 hardly seems any different. But if you put some effort into it, you'll find much more in store here. The combat system is widely criticized for the wrong reasons. To be fair, the easiest way to fail at Risen 3 was the only way to WIN in Risen 2: button mashing is heavily discouraged in Risen 3, as timing your combos poorly results in substantially slower attacks. Instead, the game encourages you to time your attacks with precision, and focus your efforts between multiple foes instead of trying to spam them to death one at a time. It also has a dodge maneuver, which Risen 2 lacked on release (and when they patched it in, it was hardly any more useful). In fact, the dodge led to quite the opposite criticism: that combat was too easy, since dodging made you invulnerable during the animation. (A patched-in "Ultra" difficulty removes these invincibility frames, if you dare - as well as forcing a cooldown between potion uses.) Beyond that, skills you can learn from instructors give you a parry ability, faster combos, additional combo attacks, and further stat increases to make you unstoppable by the end of the game. It's still not a flawless combat system overall, but this is a world where Skyrim's dreadful DPS-focused combat dodges any ounce of criticism while a game like this is torn to pieces over a moderately tactical system.The magic system is a bit unique, and certainly much more appealing than the lame voodoo system of Risen 2. Combat magic is available to all three factions, but much more varied to the Guardian faction. Some spells are equipped as a primary weapon and used in place of a sword - these spells can be used as a moderately-ranged attack in melee, or aimed as a projectile. Support magic can be placed in your quickbar for a single rapid cast, after which it requires a cooldown. Each faction has their unique spells which can only be acquired through the faction, but single-use versions (scrolls, voodoo dolls, runestones) can be found and used by any class as a disposable magical support with no cooldown.The only thing that truly disappointed me about the magic was that there was hardly any difference between the different types of offensive magic. Fire and Ice did the same amount of damage, for example, and had no unique effects, such as freezing enemies or igniting them. You only switched between them if you found an enemy who was immune to one and not the other.The world design is notably improved. The game does re-use two islands from Risen 2, and scales them down considerably, but the new locations are significantly larger, have more to explore, and have areas of the map that open up as you complete more of the story. The maps themselves are a bit more open, but still tend toward a frustratingly path-focused design that makes most of the locations seem more linear than they really are. Thankfully, they've expanded the game in a vertical direction, allowing you a BIT more freedom in climbing. It's still obvious where you can and cannot climb, for the most part, but ambitious explorers may find rewards hidden in unexpected places if you can find a way. A large assortment of books can be found throughout, attempting to expand the game's lore or close some of the plotholes left between the previous titles.I can't say the characters have improved significantly - there are plenty of fodder characters who just seem cut and paste from the previous game, and are often indistinguishable from others, but they've greatly increased in number, and the dialog has vastly increased as well. Many of the characters are still cringe-worthy or dull as dishwater, but a few still made a note with me as I played, such as the woeful Mortimer on Fog Island, the quiet yet stoic demon hunter Kane, and the misforunate Burke, many of whom have interesting quests or even just stories to tell.You know what to expect with the questing - most RPG's these days have the same number of fetch or exterminate quests, but even in this regard, I'd say Risen 3 at least makes some of them more interesting. If you're feeling adventurous, make sure you disable quest markers - otherwise, if you're getting bored, use them to wrap up sidequests quickly. At least Risen 3's questgivers will tell you what to do and where to go, so you don't HAVE to depend on floating arrows to guide you if you don't want them.The number of items in the game has increased, with more variety to melee weapons, magic, and firearms. Some of the weapons are mechanically indistinguisable from each other (crossbows vs. pistols, for example) yet require different skills to use. The "legendary items" quests from Risen 2 make a return, and number slightly higher, providing potent stat increases. Unique weapons can be found in two pieces, to be reforged at a smithy - but with no clues on how to find these weapons, it's quite possible you'll have better ones by the time you find both pieces.Unfortunately, the game again shipped with day-one DLC, with two story DLC's and one item-only one. Needless to say, developing gameplay content prior to release and charging separately for it is not a practice that consumers should ever endorse, but at least each DLC is slightly larger than Risen 2's, with a smaller price tag.Final consensus: this game does not do enough to change the most vitriolic opinions about Risen 2. Nevertheless, Piranha Bytes appears to have taken some of the largest points of contention into consideration with Risen 3. Not everything got done that fans wanted, but in the shorter development time, dealing with internal restructuring and losing major designers, I think Piranha Bytes was able to focus on their most egregious sins and provide a substantial package that I don't regret paying for.;Recommended;84.7;22/02/2015;379;6
Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;Pros- Incredible visuals. Probably the best fire I've seen in a game.- Goofy as usual. Piranha Bytes hasn't changed a bit, and I like it.- Great open world gameplay. There's a lot to explore and find.- Magic is back, and it's satisfying.Cons- Awkward sword combat--things just don't feel quite right, but with time, you get used to it.- Companions aren't as helpful as they are capable.- Story is decent, but unmemorable.- Astral vision ability could have been a lot cooler if there were puzzles or areas where it was required. I found I never really used it.VerdictIf you're looking for a decent, challenging RPG with a sense of humor, definitely get this game. The whole series is fun. Don't expect a Witcher game, but don't let the Metacritic score scare you off either.(Take the Witcher comment with a grain of salt. If you don't like that series, then <insert favorite RPG here>);Recommended;38.1;4/10/2014;322;11
Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;I recommend this game for those who enjoy a challenge.  NOT for players seeking the details.  READ the CONS, if these truly matter to you, DO NOT BUY. If you can live without those for a challenge, then this is a game for you.I do NOT feel this game is worth the $50.00, so if you feel this is for you, be sure to follow it and wait for a sale.The only problems I've had, none game breaking thus far, are1. Purchase points: a. I chose this game after reading the reviews of those who had 50+ game hours, ensuring that I was getting information and recommendations from payers who not only take time to truly evaluate a game, but also enjoy the same challenge that I do and really try to learn.   b.  I also choose it after viewing the acheivments and seeing the acheivements 'Perfectionist: complete 300 quests", and kill ### so and so monster or animal. Many of the other acheivments are to complete specific quests, or that is how it appeared to me, So this part made my decision a touch more difficult.The Purchase point that disappointed me most was B.  I have yet to join a faction, I only have mages up to the joining ceremony and yet it shows I have completed 146 quests.  I've completed almost half of the game before I even join a faction??? By the time I do join a faction I will have completed over half of the entire game.  ( Unless I am understanding the acheivment incorrectly, and 'Perfectionist" does NOT mean that you complete all quests in the game. )  Mind you, There are EXTREMELY important ..... abilities / items not obtainable until you do join a faction.And the reason I have completed so many quests is where they placed Quests.  What I mean by this is what actions or goals are considered quests.  An example is when you begin the game, you start on a ship, your woken up and told to come top side to join your 'mate' ( I will do my best to give away the absolute least regarding story or spoilers. ) and literally you only need exit the room to complete your first quest,  " Find so and so island"  When did I 'FIND' it?  In truth someone else found it.  I only woke up and moved my arse.    2.  The combat:  a. CON:  Combat is difficult, so far every monster I have met is able to attack without so much as a wind up or a way to tell they are about to strike, thus not giving you a chance to dodge or block, my attacks are however all wind ups, meaning all monster seem to break my attacks over and over. If I am attacked by 2 or 3 monsters I have had to run because one will complete attacking and as I wind up my attack the next one interupts me, and another attacks after that. Basically meaning I can't get a single hit in on them as they pummel me.  Also they get 2 to 3 consecutive attacks without my being able to interupt with my own attacks, I am only able to dodge like mad or pray they dont break my block. While every one of my attack is interuptable. b. PRO:  OMG the challenge to perfect this is amazing.  I've never played a game that has started with such a combat system that forces you to learn mechanics so quickly.3.  Dialog: a. CON:  Dialog is a bit lame, when reporting a quest complete, if the quest has more then one objective you have to select each objective as completed, then after you go through the "I finished this part, I finished this part, I finished this part, I finished this part, you have to then click "I did everything you asked me to."  As if clicking 4 times for 4 objectives isn't enough to prove you completed all tasks.    CON:  Some dialog choices are out of order, Your only available selection will be "I'll take you there."  and their responce will be "Ohh thank you."  " I did this, and the monsters are everywhere."  "How will I get home?"  Giving me the 'Will you help me' statement AFTER the 'yea, I'll help ya."  CON:  Voice overs,Just before you leave the first island an important event occurs, and a party member joins you When you speak to this member they have a specific tone, and way of speaking. After speaking with them regarding several different things as you travel, their voice will change, suddenly as if they fired the voice over actor and were to lazy to fix the previous voice over recordings. And what I mean by change isn't simply the tone, it is also the manner in which words are spoken.  b. PRO:  The amount of information provided is very nice, your given much information regarding missions, characters, locations and story content.4. Map:  a. CON:  You are given very little detail on your mini-map and full screen map, making travel difficult, and understanding which way you need to go to enter certain 'interior zones. b. PRO:  This is actually more realistic for the era the game is played in as map makers were not as meticulous as they are now adays, and adds to the challenge of the game.5. Mission Log: a. CON:  Finding specific missions that you are on, in order to mark key points on your map, can be can be very difficult as it is a bit difficult to understand how they catagorized things. b. PRO:  as you move through the missions and add more quests to your log the rhyme and reason become apparent, easier to navagate, but also makes sense.So, although there are many cons, I personally am enjoying the game, because the cons really don't break the game play, and the pro's seem to show me that the developer was looking to increase the overall challenge instead of spending to much time on the little things that can be easily ignored.  I understand that when a company releases a game as completed that it means they have fixed the bugs and CONS I have mentioned above.  This is why I only recommend the game to those who are specifically seeking a challenge, and NOT for players who are simply looking for story and graphics.Well that's my two cents, (Looking back) ok that's more like a buck 50,  I hope this information helps you decide if this is a game for you, and thank you for giving my first review time to read. :)I hope you all enjoy!!;Recommended;37.0;28/10/2014;195;12
Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;Hard to place this one in the trilogy.One one hand, it's a substantial improvement from R2 and R1 in many respects - combat is much more fluid, movement is better, visuals are great and the RPG progression is good, too. It also finally has a more solidified identity - it's got magic, piracy, voodoo and muskets. It's a cool setting.On the other, R1 does exploration the best with the single island immersion as well as overall much better dialogue and characters. One of the weakest points of both R2 and R3 is that they function more as hub worlds to explore, rather than one big area like Faranga in R1. This makes a big difference in how the games feel.Quest design overall is much better in R1, too. Both R2 and R3 feel more like generic RPG fetch quests and kill x to progress in many areas with a distinct lack of consequence. R1, Gothic and Elex all do quests much better.Another issue with R3 is it's actually too easy. There's a lack of weakness and feeling of meaningful progression. Once I got Demon Hunter spells - particularly thunderbolt - I basically obliterated everything from then on and the world design carried me forward. The combat is good, but it's too easy - and ultra difficulty is broken, because they decided that removing i-frames on dodge (including the blink) was a way to make it harder. Terrible idea.I'd rank it equal to the second game, and the first game better than both - which is somewhat surprising because the first game tends to fall apart fast when you hit the final chapters. Risen 2 is the funniest with great dialogue, Risen 3 has the most beautiful designs and fluid combat, but Risen 1 has the best overall world and gameplay progression, which is most important.I think the whole trilogy is worth grabbing and playing really - they're all good games and made with a lot of heart, but it certainly has a bit of an identity crisis with its setting, and some fairly obvious blemishes.Thumbs up.;Recommended;25.8;28/11/2022;38;1
Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;Rating (out of 10)★★★★★★★ (7)OverviewRisen 3 is a fun, wonky open-world RPG. It's kinda like a medium-budget third-person pirate-themed version of Skyrim, except not remotely as good.Positive (good features)✔ It's fun. Walk around, find stuff, fight stuff. Fun.✔ Nice variety of enemies.✔ There aren't many decent role-playing games in this setting.✔ Learning skills from people is such a nice, organic way to approach it.✔ The gnomes are very entertaining.Neutral (average/expected features)♦ Fully voiced.♦ Nice music.♦ Lots of terrain to explore.♦ Over a 100 quests. Some of them are actually kinda interesting.♦ Looks decent enough. Some of the environments are well done.Negative (bad features)✖ Terrible boss battles. The first sea monster battle nearly made me quit. They lie and say "keep your distance" but you have to get up close!✖ Tons of awful dialogue written by a 12-year-old who just discovered swearing.✖ Some of the women seem to have been designed by 12-year-olds as well. Patty is the worst example.✖ You get a quest early on that requires you to get past an invisible wall (above the lava) that isn't explained. You need to progress in the main story first.✖ Your sister and crew have nothing to say about the fact that you got your spirit back. Or about anything that happens on Skull Island really.✖ You often need the Wiki to find items. Some legendary items are locked behind mini-games.✖ There are two rotating puzzles and i rage-quit during both. Horrendous.✖ Fast-travelling is a pain. There are too many islands and not enough teleporters.✖ Lots of backtracking to steal from more difficult chests/people.✖ You have to rely on waypoints far too much and they don't indicate heighth (e.g. someone might be in a mine below).✖ There are too many crafting stations (like 8 or so) which makes crafting needlessly annoying✖ Once you have 100 Toughness you are indestructible. Even a crystal titan couldn't harm me.✖ Many enemies have knockback attacks and that gets grating after a while. No skill or item helps with it either. ✖ The interface is too cramped, clumsy and buggy.✖ Without a guide you have no idea what items to keep and what to sell.ConclusionRisen 3 is very wonky and could have been substantially better with only a few changes. But it's also simply fun. The world is interesting and there's always something new to explore. Combat can be annoying at times but never gets old. The quality is in the details. The gnome whose auri culci (personal relic) you keep finding. The little ways you can mess with people. The little bags of gold and throwing knives that seem to be all over the place. It never gets boring and aside from the terrible boss battles and puzzles nothing really got on my nerves.Details⯍ Experience with genre: Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Two Worlds, Two Worlds 2, Risen, Risen 2, Gothic, etc.⯍ Experience with game: Completed every single quest, including all faction quests.⯍ Recommended to: People who like open-world games like the ones mentioned above.;Recommended;70.4;17/04/2019;58;1
Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;Lets start with the bad:- some weird texture glitches- melee combat system- mobs teleport/slide to you- you telepot/slide to mobs- combat magic kinda disappointing- less structured progress- lack of actual threat- weird pacing- game ending..I have finished the game and have to say, despite its problems I have really enjoyed it, there is a ton of content, I have spent 55 hours with the game on my first playthrough which is a fantastic result for a very low price.There are good connections with Risen 2 so it feels like a decent continuation of the series. It is regretfully more like Risen 2 than Risen 1 despaite what the devs told us, this is not a return to Gothic.Still a very good experience, Piranha Bytes knows how to create a packed world, engaging story, likeable character, cool conversations, follower system is actually not bad it gives you a bit of configuration. If you are a weak in melee you can pick a fighter, if you are good in melee you can take a ranged or healer follower. They are a bit OP which brakes gameplay. However, the follower conversations, quest and comments they make in game are prefect, they are not annoying but present just about enough, sometimes the comments where shocking or funny, there is a great flavour there.Can easily recomend this, I can't understand why people are complaining, this is a good game. When I saw Elex I am still not convinced, but having warmed up to Risen 3 I will definitely give Elex a chance.;Recommended;58.5;7/06/2017;37;1

Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;Risen 3 is a really good game and it doesn't deserve all the hate towards its combat system, speech and graphics. You don't need to play the previous Risen series in order to play this one. However, it will be good if you do. You play the brother of Patty the pirate, and somehow the islands are being threatened by a Shadow Lord who wants to be a Titan Lord. Your job is to stop him by all means which includes talking to a parrot!Combat system:The combat system here is really easy to master. By tapping the directional keys twice, you are able to dodge the attack in that direction. You get the dodging skill at the very start of the game, so what's the complain about too difficult for beginners? They should just practise more. Slashing, parrying and additional damage are all clearly explained.Speech:The one liners in the game are really funny. The voice of the actors are fine, not great but okay. The hero's voice could have been better. He doesn't sound very interested in the quests. Graphics:The graphics are way better than Risen 2 and it looks really nice at highest setting. I don't know why people are complaining. They better get their eyesight checked. So, if you haven't bought this game, please check the following:Do you like role-playing game?Do you like long solo adventures?Do you like to solve lots of quests and help people? Do you like to be a pirate?Do you like to hoard stuff with no weight restrictions?Do you like to buy a cheap game when on sale?Do you trust me in this review? If you say yes to all of the above, then please buy this game. You won't regret it!Now, once you start playing this game, there's only two things you need to know: Dodge and Bones.These two will save you countless times in the game. I'm not going to reveal too much so that you can enjoy the game yourself. Have fun!Rating: 92%;Recommended;170.4;7/03/2018;50;2
Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;I normally played turn-based RPG, but decided to try Risen 3 for a change.I totally enjoyed this game. It has a great storyline and is extremely immersive.I spend many hours carefully picking up everything, collecting all Legendary Items, and Reforging the best Weapons in the game.I also spend many hours trying to get all the Steam Achievements and was able to do so in a single playthough as a Demon Hunter. It seems that this is the only faction that you can get all achievements in a single playthrough. The other 2 factions, Guardian and Natives all have missing achievements.The combat sequence was extremely fun too. The only hard part for me was the Sea Battles and the Final Boss Fight, because they both require fast interactive responses which was difficult for me. The mini-game were really fun, although the archery one is quite difficult too. However, getting Legendary Items from instances of certain mini-game were a great idea and an incentive as well.Anyway this is really a fun game and it is wonderful to spend many hours in it.I highly recommend this game.;Recommended;162.6;25/04/2016;73;1
Deep Silver;Risen 3: Titan Lords;RPG;R$ 27,99;Good old Piranha Bytes with their wonky combat system, meh story, beautiful handcrafted worlds and funny but raunchy dialogues. Yes it's not as good as Gothic 1 and 2 but even Skyrim wasn't as good as Gothic 2 in my opinion. But you can still have some good fun with it if you like the way PB does their games. This game isn't for everyone and has some flaws. But for what it is, it's a pretty fun game with a good amount of content. Took me 103 hours to complete the game and I don't even regret one minute of it. Loved the game personally.;Recommended;103.4;20/08/2018;30;N/I

Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;Beyond the technical presentation, Sacred 3 feels like little more than a cheap mobile game. All you do is grind your way through samey levels, punching samey enemies with samey attacks, and you never feel rewarded for any of it. The cinematics are well produced, the graphics are okay and the soundscape is generally decent, but when the gameplay is so incredibly void of interesting mechanics, and never rewards you for all the monotonous grinding, it’s a hard sell at €50. Even if you ignore the fact that it’s supposed to be a sequel to a series of games that play completely differently, the game doesn’t become any more acceptable as its own thing either. Far better games can be found at far lower prices. The other Sacred games, for starters.2/5Full review:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/sacred-3/;Not Recommended;9.7;31/07/2014;3,517;6
Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;This game is the reason why they have the demand not to swear written in the Rules and Guidelines. Because if that weren't there I would have a few choice words for this game.The first thing you will notice is it's no longer made by Ascaron... Someone bought the rights to use the name and I fell for it. Well, I guess it's my own fault that I trusted the name "Sacred" and expected another good game and that I coughed up 50 Euros without getting informed.If you don't know Sacred you may very well like this game, don't let me stop you from trying it.If you are a fan of Sacred however, don't make the same mistake I made. You will kick yourself for wasting so much money. Aside from the name and aside from sporting a Seraphim character, this product really has nothing in common with Sacred.I only hope I can spare a few people from the bitter disappointment I felt. I hope you guys are smarter than I was and actually read these reviews before you throw your money out the window.;Not Recommended;1.2;21/10/2014;658;16
Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;Ok guys i try not to write bad reviews but this game is just missing everything sacred has been over the years. The quest, freedom and diversity we know and love is gone and replaced by an arcade game with bad cut scenes and disgraceful gameplay.This Sacred game starts out with terrible jokes and tries to be funny in the cutscenes. From there you go into a arcade score values hack and slash with no loot, no real level up system and very very little freedom. In the first hour of the game you are fighting the same enemies and bosses while auto attacking with fiddly controls and annoying voice over for combos. The only damage numbers are for critical hits and interrupts. Not to mention the options menu that was made for atari. Sacred 3 would be a nothing but an indie game that you pick up for under $10 on a steam sale, if it didnt have 2 very successful games in the series to start off with. To play a game with no real goals and a boring story line that has been used before i suggest spending your well earned cash on something more enjoyable and that would last longer, like pizza or a haircut.  I personally do not recommend this game at all. If you still want to pick it up steam sales when its around $15 bucks would be your best bet.;Not Recommended;3.3;31/07/2014;1,053;2
Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;Sacred 3 is a dumbed down version, with linear mission, no open world, no costumization, no exploration, and combat system isn't much fun either.If they would have made the same game under a different name, we may could talk about a positve review, but after Sacred 2 this is a shame to the Series, and players.Of what I've played, every second felt like a insult.

Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;Giving Sacred 3 a negative review is like beating a dead horse. With a bloody Mjölnir. And extreme prejudice. Everybody hated this game. Literally, everybody. But since it was years since the initial release of the game and all of us had more than enough time to calm down a bit, I think it's a good time to look back for a bit and think. Was Sacred 3 really that bad? Let's find out.The original Sacred was a blast. Not only it was one of the most ambitious games in the genre (up to this day nobody ever tried to create such a huge ARPG, as long as we're not talking “online only” stuff), it was also one of those rare cases when ambitions didn't lead to the failure. It was a huge game taking place in open world environment. And it was good. Sure, the balance was all over the place but the game wasn't about balance. It was about pure ARPG fun in a scale that never been shown before. Well, technically it was but you know what I mean. We're talking Diablo here, not The Faery Tale Adventure. Not only the world in Sacred was huge, it also looked beautiful, had a nice handmade feeling and there were tons of quests to complete. Naturally, as the result, it ended up being a big hit. Press loved it, players loved it, there were novels, merchandise and so on.Naturally, everybody expected a lot from sequel. And it sure promised a lot. The game got proper 3D visuals, there were versions for actual gaming consoles, while soundtrack came with an exclusive track from legendary band Blind Guardian whose members even appeared in a game with their own quest that led to some sort of in-game concert. Unfortunately, this time ambitions did lead the developers into a trap and the game turned out to be... let's just say it wasn't that great. And not only because setting didn't feel the same thanks to all the machinery stuff that was added. It's like nothing felt fun anymore. 3D environment didn't feel nearly as satisfying as 2D one, the new leveling system where monsters grew up with you (only up to the certain point but still) didn't feel right, the quests weren't nearly as good... It was one of those games that were unable to be nearly as good as their predecessors. And, of course, there were bugs. Tons of them. Tons and tons of bugs... But it's not like series didn't have any future. Quite the opposite. Sacred 3 had all the chances to save it. Unfortunately, some “brilliant” mind at Deep Silver decided to give the series... a modern look. I mean, who cares about big worlds and quests, right? The kids nowadays? They're all about quick co-op sessions!And it's kind of fun because even more famous series ended up suffering from the same exact statistics-based mistake. I'm talking, of course, about Command & Conquer. Can't call myself a big fan of Command & Conquer 3, but hey! At least it was something. And then boom! EA decided to give the series a “fresh” look and... yeah. We've all seen C&C 4. But you know what? After finishing Sacred 3 today, I can't say it's especially terrible. For what it is? It's totally playable. Sure, it's just a short series of the co-op maps that feel exactly the same. Sure, the setting was altered again and the game began to feel more like Borderlands than the original Sacred. And sure, the gameplay was turned from a proper ARPG experience into something from Xbox Live Arcade. You know... a bloody Castle Crashers. But at the same time, it looked spectacular (even today, it looks pretty competitive) and if all you need is a quick co-op fun for a half of an hour? Well, let's just say I've seen worse. Way worse. Wa-a-a-ay worse. But here's a question for you, Deep Silver. Why did you call it Sacred 3? See, not so long before it, there was another co-op game in Sacred universe. It was called Sacred Citadel and guess what? Nobody hated it. Sure, nobody loved it but... you know. Nobody hated it. And heck, I don't even think that J2ME version of the first game was that bad. But you called it “Sacred 3 and advertised it as the next big thing. And that's where the problem lies. Just because Sacred 3 is not the next big thing for the series. Heck, it isn't even a proper Sacred title. Like Command & Conquer 4 is not a proper Command & Conquer. But call it a spin off? And a lot of pain will instantly disappear. I mean... let's just admit it, we survived Tiberian Alliances and Command & Conquer Rivals. Sure we can survive something like this. And like I didn't mind playing through Sacred Citadel, I can't say I hated Sacred 3 much.Sure, I can't say I liked it. And I sure can't call it a good game (we'll return to it a bit later). But as a short and dumb co-op-oriented spin-off? I can't say it's the worst thing ever. You have a friend, some beer (make it a lot of beer) and a free weekend? You can actually have some fun here. And with present day price tag of $14.99 / £10.99 for the full version with all DLC included? It really isn't that bad. Especially when it's on sale. The fact that some people are actually still playing it is a nice example of how this game works fine as a cheap spin-off.On the other hand, even if we'll consider Sacred 3 as a cheap spin-off, it's still far from being good game. It's one of those titles that you get on sale for a couple of bucks and play when you have nothing else on your account. Willingly selecting it as your next co-op experience is... arguable. To say the least. It's short, the entire game is just a bunch of tiny little maps and all of those maps feel exactly the same. Lack of enemy types, lack of strategy, lack of variety, lack of... everything. That's pretty much what Sacred 3 is all about. But still, the biggest crime of this game is not the fact that it's a dull co-op-oriented experience but the way it's advertised. Dixi.;Not Recommended;75.5;28/07/2020;145;5
Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;Just terrible, limited customization, on rails levels with no open world unlike it's predeccessors had to be a great game. All I can see from this is mindless button mashing.A bad money grab in the end.;Not Recommended;3.0;31/07/2014;746;1
Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;The most disappointing game I have played in a long time. A series of rather high quality in-depth action rpg's made into a simplistic, almost primitive arcade-style game I would expect as a gaming hall or browser title, not a full-price wanna-be blockbuster. An all-use ingame currency instead of diverse loot, near to no armor or weapon variation and customization. As well as hardly any attack or skill variation: light attack, heavy attack (shield breaker), and 2 skill slots with 5 alternatives to use in each, that's it, no diverse combat, just button mashing. Linear and quite limited maps instead of a living, breathing, npc-settled open world. One mission / level after the other with point recap in between, just like stages in a 90's arcade side-scrolling game.I'm usually the last one to totally dismiss a game but I can only advise anybody to never touch this one, especially if you expected this to be a diablo / sacred style action rpg. Console port is in fact a very small excuse for (imho) destroying a (rather) popular and quite high quality game series like this.;Not Recommended;0.8;2/08/2014;371;1
Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;All the reviews for this game seem to exclusively focus on the change of direction/mechanics compared to previous titles in the franchise, so If you're looking for an objective review free from nostalgia, this one is for you.This game is bad, It's almost tragic because the art is top-notch: music, 2D art, models, animations, even the way the characters move and control feels nice, but it comes down to the bad gameplay mechanics.This game uses a brawling/hack&slash style combat that feels clunky and unresponsive, this due to how the different actions from the character can never be interrupted to perform other actions, things like throwing enemy characters or finishing them off puts you on a state where you can't dodge or evade incoming enemy attacks, you have to wait until the animation is over to do anything, all while still been vulnerable to enemy attacks. Other games alleviate this by making you invulnerable for the duration of a finishing move animation, or simply by pushing all enemies aside and make them not attack you until your action is over. Also in other games you can cancel most moves with your dodge, not in this game.The difficulty is all over the place, I had play in the highest difficulty level due to the game being too easy and soon realized it's very inconsistent, all due to balance issues. Some combination of enemies can make short work of your HP bar in seconds without any chance of dodging, some other combination will stunlock you untill you die, some other times those same enemies in another combination wont even be able to touch you, the flow of the combat doesn't seem to be particularly well designed.The game is also very repetitive, you'll be fighting mostly the same 5 enemies and their variations throughout all the levels, most of which, frankly, the game could've done without, resulting in a much shorter game. I finished it in 8 hours, but I bet it would be like 4-5 without all the fluff.Lastly, Im the kind of person who can ignore bad dialogue/narrative in games when they aren't part of the main gameplay mechanics like in this game, if you are not, I feel like I have to warn you, the story telling on this is just meh and closer to bad, the dialogue is also bad and tries to be funny while failing, sometimes the characters will start talking in a weird tone for no reason, like girl, we know you aren't tiny tina, stop, you're totally out of character lol.;Not Recommended;13.2;16/01/2018;72;3
Deep Silver;Sacred 3;Action, RPG;R$ 27,99;This is Sacred in name only, be warned.Sacred 1 and 2 were wonderful open world games, with lots of loot, and a decent combat skill selection. They both had decent stories and character progression. My advice for franchise fans, is to go replay sacred 1 and 2, skip this. If you pre-ordered like I did... I am so sorry. This game doesn't even pretend to be the same genre.This is an isometric brawler with very limited combat. There are no selection of combos, no character customizaton, no hot swapping skills, and no loot! You pick from a limited selection of skills (you get 2 in mission, from a limited pool), and a selection of weapons that are nigh identical, but must be unlocked through the story. Combat is repetitive, oh so repetitive. Controls are somewhat awkward on the PC. This seems to be geared more towards a console platform in that regard.The voice acting is decent, and for sacred fans, the cheesy lines are still there, but that may be all that remains. There is little to no character development, and the story itself seems to be a tired reincarnation of "evil being attempts to destroy world for some reason". Graphics are not bad... not great, but they certainly could be worse. If you want a simple brawler, this is alright, but not worth the $50 price tag (there are similar, much cheaper titles available). Give this one a pass. R.I.P.

Codemasters;Dirt 5;Action, Adventure, Casual, Racing, Sports;R$ 109,99;It's fun, but don't buy it yet. It's a Codemasters game so we all know what that means. Remember what they did with Dirt 2.0? We were supposed to get everything in the so-called deluxe edition, but then they released the super deluxe edition. Well, here they renamed the amplified edition to "year one" edition, which means they're saving the bigger expansions, add-ons for later. In other words: Year two pass. Codemasters are no strangers to multiple season passes. Also, "Year 1 Edition players get access to all DIRT 5 content in the 12 months after launch". No, we didn't.

Codemasters;Dirt 5;Action, Adventure, Casual, Racing, Sports;R$ 109,99;I wouldn't normally call a racing game 'uplifting' but this game is so upbeat and energetic that it always puts me in a good mood. I understand why longtime Dirt fans dislike it (they really should've made this a spin-off), but as a newcomer to the series i'm LOVING the game. It's super arcadey and straightforward. You just unlock cars and go through the campaign races until you reach the credits. It's such a breath of fresh air from the bloated NFS and forza horizon games. I just wanna race through cool locations and listen to good music, and this game delivers! The weather system is INCREDIBLE. I was in awe the first time lightning struck and the soundtrack is phenomenal!

Codemaster has lost their touch with the Dirt series just as much as they've lost their touch with Grid, it's sad to see since it's not hard to provide what the earlier games did but with next-gen graphics and physics, but apparently it's hard enough so that a major company like Codemaster can't get it right.

Codemasters;Dirt 5;Action, Adventure, Casual, Racing, Sports;R$ 109,99;I understand why some fans of the series didn't like this game. It is a departure from the previous entry, Dirt 4. It's a very arcadey game with a very different handling model. There isn't traditional rally included in the game.That said, judging this game on its own merits and disregarding any relationship to the Dirt brand, I've had a lot of fun with this game. The racing is a lot of fun, the tracks, though few, are exciting with beautiful environments and a lot of verticality and variety. I couldn't stand Dirt 4. Found it too much like Dirt Rally "lite," I'm having way more fun with this one.

Codemasters;Dirt 5;Action, Adventure, Casual, Racing, Sports;R$ 109,99;(for reference. played on both steam and xbox free play day promotions. played by someone dubbed a "boomer" by an active codemasters employee for voicing a few of these wild opinions via private channel)A strange and confusing “tribute”. McRae would be turning six feet under. Block, Pastrana and every other name historically involved with this franchise would be embarrassed to be associated with it.On the surface, Dirt 5 seems like a “return to form” or some sort of revival of that early era of the franchise. The mathematical fact that Dirt 2 + Dirt 3 = Dirt 5 was bought up multiple times pre-release, by both marketing and the irritatingly chipper community liaisons. Sadly, the numbers appear to lie.It is worth remembering that the Codemasters who developed the primary iterations of this game are a completely different team to today, from the boots-on-the-ground devs to the studio leads calling the shots and making decisions. This is much less a “Dirt” game as it is the remains of the Onrush team and technologies (which was already gutted when Codemasters failed to support or advertise their risky new game) grafting Dirt IP and assets into this game engine. Putting it bluntly Dirt 5 is a completely different game dolled up into something it isn’t.The Onrush weather effects and landscapes are back and look as gorgeous as they ever did.Gameplay. In previous titles, cars and tracks were divided into assorted categories with unique course designs to benefit the individual physics of each vehicle discipline. Trophy truck tracks were fast and flowing with big air and banked turns to keep the slow-accelerating, heavyweight race trucks at speed. Rallycross tracks were tight and technical point-and-squirt affairs, to compliment the RX car’s quick handling and high power. Dirt 5 appears to allow any car to race on any track, and while at first this may seem to be a positive, the fact is that a painful majority of courses are very wide, very flat and very generic in order to allow each type of vehicle to have an easy, competitive race, with their only distinguishing features being the environment outside the track. Add the game’s slow, vague handling to the mix, alongside awkward collision physics and braindead AI, and Dirt 5 quickly becomes a completely unengaging and frequently infuriating driving experience.Cars snag on walls. Tracks limits are all solid objects, and either stop you dead or allow you to wallride around corners in thin air thanks to invisible barriers. Ram into the rear of another car at speed and you are likely to just slide under it like a Fast & Furious ramp car. There is no “rewind” function, and more often than you’d like you’ll find yourself getting dumped by AI in the final sector of the final lap of a race, being forced to start over again. Which is great fun when you’re tasked with navigating one of the enormous Baja rigs through a chokepoint or hairpin they are not designed for, with 11 raging AI frothing at the mouth to wreck you. And not in an exciting way.In terms of things like rubber banding, AI will gladly come to a halt mid-air rather than completing an expected flight arc. Physics does not exist to them.If you were not aware, stage rallying and hillclimb racing are not in Dirt 5. Contrary to the rabid opinions of Dirt’s fanbase, they would not make the game any better.To its credit, the game’s car list is pretty deep and varied. There’s a healthy mix of real, fictional, custom and concept cars with most corners of off-road motor racing represented. You can Google it. Particular highlights include the plethora of electric concept cars, the returning rally raid cars and some choice additions to Dirt’s existing roster.But as nice as these cars are, an absolute minimum of them (as in, three cars circa the last update) feature their real-life “hero” liveries. By default, each vehicle has a blank livery, and, if you’re lucky, the car you want to drive may have an unlockable livery you earn from ranking up in career mode. All of these are lurid pop-art messes from the questionable pen of Sean Bull Design. Compare these to the fictional paint schemes from previous titles, which all at least looked like legitimate racing team liveries. I don’t even know what half of these Dirt 5 “art pieces” are. Most of them are simply plain patterns with no numbering or sponsorship.There is technically a livery editor, but it is a typical Codemasters affair with patterns, changeable colours and sponsor slots. Everything in it must be unlocked and I’m not even sure you can manually edit colours with slider values ala Codemasters’ F1.Onto music and sound design. Dirt soundtracks are hallowed ground in the hall of racing game music, being curated and segregated into different playlists and atmospheres for the separate sections of gameplay with impeccable variety and selection. It goes without saying that Dirt 5’s soundtrack falls flat on its face. 98% of the tracks in this title are completely generic edgy-british-indie ad-music that plays on loop in-race and in-menu. Apparently there’s Prodigy, High Contrast, even Stormzy hidden in here, but I’ve yet to hear them over the likes of “I’m Gonna Light It Up” on veritable repeat.Codemasters made a big deal about their partnership with “Donut Media” and other social media influencers who provide voiceover and audio context to the story (whatever that is). Apparently, they roped in racing game Youtubers to guest on these in-game “podcasts” as well. So it seems they ditched actual charismatic individuals in the motorsport world in lieu of influencers and internet commentators. Baffling.They say this game is meant to “capture the atmosphere” of, or be a tribute to, that early era of Dirt games. Aside from some returning voiceless AI drivers in the post-race results, and the tenuous art style, I cannot see anything to suggest it is. It's just wholly disappointing, even outright upsetting.Buy Gravel and a Dirt 3 Steam key. You will have a far more wholesome experience.;Not Recommended;0.3;20/03/2021;78;N/I

Codemasters;F1 2020;Racing, Simulation, Sports;None;great game, my team is awesome, the AI are excellent as far as racing game AI goes, they fight, they lock up, they make mistakes ( go back and watch replays when somebody has had an off ahead of you and you will see all kinds of mistakes happen, it adds so much immersion to the game when you see AI going through what you the player goes through ) breakdowns, crashes, battles... just great,i play sim racing games all the time and see a lot of people crap on these F1 games for being not very simulation but what im seeing is the cars behave almost exactly how they would in real life, these are extremely high downforce, light as hell racing cars, nothing else comes close to the cornering speed and people are expecting you to feel the car bouncing around a corner like its a GT3 car. ive played plenty of ACC and yes F1 is a much easier game but thats because F1 cars are much easier to drive than a skittish gt3 car with little downforce in comparison, up the AI difficulty and you will have as hard a challenge as you like, take off the assists and you will be having way more crashes than any ''simcade'' racer has the right to give you.It could be argued that the game makes it too easy on you, like taking over the pit lane driving but its so minor and keeps things flowing how a real race would. it could also be argued you dont have much control over the cars mechanicals on track but the reality is 90 percent of an f1 steering wheel is for the engineers - not the drivers, and really, playing f1 2020 ive had to ''manage'' the car much more, tyres wear and overheat and fuel is a real pain in the a$$ actually. im pretty happy that its good enough and represents what we see f1 drivers go through really pretty well.does it feel a lot like f1 2019... yeh, ofcourse, but its been subtly improved, no more downshifting to 1st to rotate the car more, the brakes really bite a lot more as the car gets slower and approaches a corner and its a pleasant suprise how much content is packed into this, the my team mode is actually a legit reason to upgrade, lots of subtle changes add up to make another great improvement.EDIT: just want to add the developers kept microtransactions hidden until the game was released and got its reviews, i was a little disappointed to see not a lot of customisation options in the base game to start with and this so called ''podium pass'' was locked away and hidden until the reviews were out, the game is pretty packed with content so i kinda just wished they were straight up and open about this from the off that there will be tons of customisation but its hidden behind extra money, i can live with it as its not so important for me but it may turn some people off who dont like content hidden behind microtransactions and people need to know about this, you wont see it mentioned in any reviews because... hidden until reviews dropped. like most microtransactions you can earn a lot in game but it takes a lot of time and some content is time limited forcing you to make a choice to buy or lose the chance to get, its not great but it does not detract away from the quality of the game, its a brilliant racing game.;Recommended;82.9;9/07/2020;225;5

Codemasters;F1 2020;Racing, Simulation, Sports;None;F1 2020  is without a doubt, the most polished and well made in the series. That being said, it has a collection of minor flaws that keep the game from reaching true perfection. Some of these flaws are carried over from previous titles, and some are new problems that were created in the process of adding new features.I will first begin with what is amazing about F1 2020. The most refined feature of this game is not often discussed by many reviewers, and that is the controls. I personally played this game on an Xbox One gamepad with no assists, I had zero problems and the game handles like a dream. While most true sim racing games seemingly require a wheel to play to their full enjoyment, playing F1 2020 on a gamepad has no drawbacks once you get used to it. The key element that makes gamepad controls so smooth is separating force feedback (FF) into different sections based on the source of vibration. While many sim racers (raceroom being a good example) simply make all FF come from the center of the gamepad, F1 2020 assigns brake based FF to the left trigger (using the default controls) and acceleration based FF to the right trigger. This may seem like a simple solution, it smooths the process of playing with no assists considerably, as the player can now feel where the level of grip is more effectively. This also applies to wheel traction as well, so when one of your tires loses traction, you know which one it is based on FF location. This, in combination with many other refinements in gamepad controls, make the non-wheel driving experience easy to understand and improve with. The reason this is not often talked about, is because codemaster's refined control scheme has now become standard in their titles, however I believe it is important for the casual and inexperienced player to know that the barrier to entry is significantly lower because of these features.While the core gameplay itself is amazing, what about everything surrounding it? Well, to put it simply, if you have played F1 2019, you have already played around 80% of the game before. I say this in the sense that F1 2020 recycles most of the content from the previous year's game. Driver career, championship modes, classic F1 cars and invitational events all make a return. The one big addition to this game is the "my team" mode that puts the player in the position of a team owner, manager, and lead driver. Playing as a modern Jack Brabham is a somewhat refreshing take on the modern sim racer. This feature brings a lot to the table as it gives a racing game something to do other then just racing. It is important to note however, that a large portion of the content in my team is based around the foundation of R&D development from previous games, as the main choices you have to make are around which R&D department to commit to or develop.One of the more intriguing new features is the addition of driver ratings. In previous F1 games all an AI driver's speed was based on was their car and difficulty setting. With these new driver ratings, each AI driver has their own racing personality of sorts. Because of this, certain drivers might perform better in qualifying then in the race, or be more prone to ballsy overtakes then other drivers. This is especially visible in the "my team" and "driver career" modes, as with driver transfers, certain drivers might out perform their car, an example from my save being how Daniel Ricciardo consistently qualifies higher in a Mclaren than Alex Albon in a Red Bull, even though Daniel has a clearly inferior car. This small addition to the game makes quite a difference overall in the feeling of realism, as each driver feels like their own entity and no longer just an embodiment of their constructor. This also blends well with the my team mode, as it now creates a meta-game out of the driver market, as you can choose which driver to approach based on the stats your team needs.Most of F1 2020 is pure gold, however there are small pebbles and stones that keep this gem from truly shining. The biggest problem stems from the new addition of the podium pass. The podium pass is just what it sounds like, a battle pass...for F1. If you do not care about cosmetics then you can skip this section because the PP (yes I am abbreviating it like that) only unlocks visual cosmetics for the player. The PP comes with the additional features of challenges and a daily items shop, clearly emulating the microtransactions of games like Fortnite. If you are willing to pay the 10ish dollars to unlock the premium PP, it gives the game a sense of progression aside from the career modes, but if you do not, there are some small consequences. The most obvious consequence is the lack of basic cosmetics, while F1 2019 gave the player more than a dozen options for helmet designs from the beginning, F1 2020 gives only  five  (not counting DLC). Car liveries are in a similar position as only four are unlocked from the beginning, with a couple others being unlockable via grinding. Codemaster's rational for this is quite obvious, as they likely plan on re-releasing the designs from F1 2019 in the items shop throughout the year. Sidenote: Codemasters has also not yet added a way to record color coordinates for the combinations to achieve certain colors, so the process of copying a color off of a different design involves eyeballing what the color looks like.With all that being said, the customization in this game is fantastic. because of their new podium pass system, codemasters is now free to branch out more with their designs, allowing more original cosmetics like the "star and stripes" series, that have more unique design ideas. A common criticism from previous games is that each game has been using the same set of basic character animations since F1 2016. Sadly, this is still true, while I was hopeful that the addition of custom podium celebrations might signal CM attempting to create new animations, they remain the same, as do some of the pit lane graphics and computer screens. Sidenote: if you look closely at the pit lane engineer's computer screens, they all have a map of Monaco on them no matter which track you are on.This is a truly fun game to play, with fantastic core gameplay, and a host of new additions that freshen up the "formula" of this franchise (yeah I want to punch myself in the face after that pun too). Overall, F1 2020 is an amazing game, and if you are willing to either shell out an extra $10 or simply put up with a lack of cosmetic options, any seasoned sim racer or casual driver can enjoy themselves playing this game.Edit: CM added in color values for customization, hopefully they will later add the ability to manually change sponsor locations on helmets (without changing the location on the car livery).;Recommended;114.0;30/07/2020;149;2
Codemasters;F1 2020;Racing, Simulation, Sports;None;In terms of rankings:1.) Driving an actual F1 car2.) F1 20203.) F1 2019The ERS management is a tonne simpler now, you just have a big fat button labelled "OVERTAKE" to turn it up for extra power. It's actually good now too, adds like 20 mph to the top speed even on a low end car.They update the drivers now based on their real world performances, you get an in-game message saying "Driver stats have been updated" and a button you can push to apply it to your current save (by default it only affects new saves).It's got two new tracks, but the previous tracks remain largely unchanged aside from some changes to the suggested driving line. Additionally some of the 2019 kinks are ironed out, such as the weird pit lane entry if you had Pit Assist on, which is now significantly smoother. The AI is a bunch smarter, and will overtake you in some pretty clever ways. in 2019, the AI cars had set pace times, which would decay overtime based on tire wear (as opposed to having to actually drive, it was like they were scalextric cars stuck to the driving line). Now, they seem to have to drive under the same physics system you do, subject to lock ups and occasionally running wide when the conditions get a bit weird. In 2019, the Safety Car was basically a mythical creature - this time it actually shows up. You can make your own team now, with your own livery and second driver (it's usually some obscure GP3 or old F2 driver)2020 has its own issues, the practice program times are absolutely absurd compared to the difficult and incredibly hard to hit early on. This does however seem to level off once you get going with upgrades to your car. Also, the cars aren't hugely in tune with their real life counterparts, and the starting grid is basically always Merc-Merc, Ferrari - Ferrari, Red Bull, Red Bull, etc.Overall, its better than 2019 so if you liked that you'll love this.;Recommended;127.6;12/07/2020;128;8

Codemasters;GRID;Action, Racing, Simulation, Sports;R$ 319,00;While GRID Legends is a clear improvement over GRID 2019, it still leaves some stuff to be desired.From the way the story and career work to the driving physics, GRID Legends has definitely improved many aspects of gameplay making it a much more interesting game to play, but it's still not enough.The story mode makes no sense. First, it doesn't respect what you do. There's a narrative and it will follow it no matter if you just barely managed to achieve the objective they give you or if you do far better. Second, these dumb rivalries make no sense. Rivalry in older GRIDs came from teams that were just really fast, this "bad guy" trope just feels stupid.Just give us a good career mode with the features from GRID 1 like sponsor and team management and add a few more interactive features if you want.Enough of these "Drive to Survive" stories that disrespect what the player does.And, speaking of the career mode, it's still very shallow and boring. All you can do is just race in a series of events, complete X amount to unlock the next level and that's it. No sponsors, no team management, no true involvement. Just race a car and win.My main problem however is how the driving still suffers from an identity crisis.I could ignore all these issues with how the gameplay flow was designed if the driving felt good, but it sadly doesn't.TL.DR on the driving, corner entry is the only place the car is willing to rotate, after that all you get is understeer if you don't use the handbrake.While it's definitely improved from GRID 2019, they seem to be taking "baby steps" instead of trying to do a bigger overhaul, which it needs.At first I thought the problem was just the tyres keeping too much grip when skidding, but it's more than that.The tyres feel like they have a delayed grip response, they don't react immediately to the angle the car is going and this results in a very strange mid corner understeer. The problem begins when the tyres "wake up" and realize they don't have maximum grip anymore and your car gets locked into a line, like a train on rails.From GRID 1 to Autosport, the cars were always happy to rotate more through a turn if you kept turning, it was a matter of controlling the car through the entire turn, not just in the moment you start turning.That felt far more rewarding and fun to learn, Legends on the other hand treats steering like a quick-time event, press and hold the button at the right time to do the corner successfully.Using the handbrake is the only way to get the car to rotate mid turn. Most cars will benefit from using the handbrake around tighter turns and this can really ruin the quality of the racing because drivers can just get away with missing the braking zone by just pulling a quick drift.Then the actual Drift mode is pretty disappointing. The cars feel extremely awkward and in a very strange way understeery, which isn't good for a drift mode.They also suffer from the skidding grip problem, being far too grippy to actually properly drift.It doesn't come close to how nice and natural drifting was in GRID 1 or Autosport, or even GRID 2.I wouldn't buy this game for drifting.I don't recommend buying this game. Try it out with the subscription models, but don't buy it right away.;Not Recommended;78.3;24/02/2022;273;11

Codemasters;Dirt Rally 2.0;Racing, Simulation, Sports;R$ 47,49;Dear Codies,This is a real step up from the original DiRT Rally.

Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit...."Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset."...

Codemasters;Dirt Rally 2.0;Racing, Simulation, Sports;R$ 47,49;tl.dr - Get the Game of the Year Edition when it's on sale.There’s a lot this game does right and there’s a few things it does wrong but the issue is these few things are either major or "in the player's face", so to speak.For the purposes of those reading, I'm reviewing GotY DIRT Rally 2.0 which comes with the various season DLCs and the "FLAT OUT" DLC. Game ModesThere are two primary modes that come with the game: Rally and Rallycross which both have a single player and multiplayer feature. Rally is your run of the mill point to point time attack style of racing where you run through various locations and see if you're faster than your competition.Every two stages you can enter a service area and get setup changes and car repairs. Repairs are offered as either a standard repair (fully fix the part), quick fix (cheap and fast repair, but leads to the part being un-repairable and diminishes quicker) or a full on replacement of the part. Repairs are also influenced by your expandable and upgradable team mechanics.In addition to costing you time, with a limit of 30 minutes to complete your repairs, they also cost money. Yes, it’s frustrating you run out of money and the game forces choice upon the player, but that’s what makes the game fun and interesting – rally is a very harsh motorsport after all and your driving style needs to weigh speed and risk of damage. Even if you run out of money, you can just do a quick rallycross event or online event and get some quick cash, complete those repairs and continue your rally as if your brief financial worries didn't exist in the first place. Good addition.Rallycross mode hasn’t changed much since the original game. You and 4-6 other drivers compete on a circuit in a traditional race with each driver having to take one “joker” lap, that is use a section of the course which is a bit longer than the normal course or face a hefty penalty. Events are divided into heats deciding drivers qualifying for a semi-final and then a final. Readers who have played the first game will notice that I didn’t mention hillclimb. Well, we have Polyphony to thank for that. Less said about exclusivity deals especially in this day and age the better. But let's now talk about what is in the game:LocationsThe game has 7 new rallies to try with the original 6 available via DLC. These new rallies are:Argentina – Gravel, narrow for the most part and very technical. But this is such a boring rally. The stages don’t really give the driver a chance to create a flow through the corners. The roads are so narrow you can’t pendulum turn and are forced to spam your handbrake just to get rotation at such low speeds. Either get rid of this or make it more open with sections that stretch the cars legs, so to speak, more prominent. Australia – Very much in the mould of previous Australian rallies shipped with the game. Thick gravel with a mix of high speed and technical bits. Always been a solid addition to the game since the 1990s.New Zealand – As above. Perhaps more technical. But perhaps the gravel is less abrasive? There isn’t much to say about it apart from what’s mentioned for Australia. There’s only so much you can do with gravel roads, I guess.Poland – Poland is a bit like Germany but the “openness” of sorts that you get there is replaced with crests in awkward places and sections of road seeing you go at the car’s limit whilst flanked by trees. And I love it. Good stuff, Codies – a fun addition to the DR roster.Spain – This is basically Monaco but without the ice and less hairpins. Decent addition.USA – A slow grower on me. Based in New England in the autumn, this is probably similar to Poland but with less tarmac and the straight sections are much less intimidating. Still a fun rally.Perth and Kinross [DLC] – I find this to be a narrower version of Finland. The straight sections with both trees and tree stumps uncomfortably close to the road and the technical bits test the driver. In my top 3 rallies in the game.The base game comes with eight licensed World Rallycross Tracks with Holjes, and Hell making it from DR to DR2 base game. Silverstone, Mettet, Barcelona, Trois-Rivieres, Loheac Bretagne and Montalgre completing the list. Further DLC introduces Bikernieki, Estering, Yas Snorina, Lydden Hill (DR1 clone) and Killarney.I’ll say I haven’t played enough of the rallycross to give you a fair assessment.CarsCars are pretty much as per the original with the 2010s class gone and replaced by the R5 category which shares some manufacturer presence with the original game. Added as well is the Kartcross Rallycross cars and Rally GT class which has Grand Tourers like the V8 Vantage and Porsche 911 if the 80s RWD cars didn’t have enough on power oversteer for you. But all your other favourites from Subaru, Mitsubishi, Ford, Lancia, VW, Audi and Peugeot (to name a few) are all featured.Notably Toyota are still excluded from the game but with that the car roster is actually pretty good with at least one car in the full roster appealing to everyone. Conclusion, gripes/ideasAgain, this is a solid title all in all and would recommend to people into racing games but maybe are getting tired of the whole driving ‘round in circles shtick so this game maybe of interest to you!I felt the major problem with the original was a lack of content and if you include for all the DLC there’s over twice the rallies which is a nice and certainly takes a lot longer for the player to learn the stages so massive kudos to Codemasters on that one. I must say, I’ve been more critical of this game purely because the original set a high bar for me and what to expect from a sequel and just want this series to do well. Anyway, with all that said time to get into my gripes:Still putting a massive red cross against charging players for DLC of existing stages with minimal effort going into them. I mean, if you want people to be happy to fork out for the DLC of DR1 content that maybe add an extra route so there’s new stuff to explore. People don’t like being charged for stuff they’ve already played – this isn’t your yearly Formula 1 release.Pace notes – Add a tool where players can edit pace notes for stages! I shouldn’t have to play a memory game on every stage because the co-driver has forgotten to mention that big tree on the exit that can cause terminal damage or that “5 right” which is actually a 3 right. Pace notes are just as important as car setups. Doesn’t even have to be complicated, just a simple 2D map of the stage showing where the call from the co-driver is triggered and what exactly he says. When you’re done click “test stage” and drive the stage. Having a simple slider for earlier or later co-driver calls isn’t good enough as you expand the amount of track players have to remember.Setups – I really miss the sliders in the original game. Bring them back as I’m a setup pleb that doesn’t speak in exact terms as to how I want stuff done. Being able to go “ah yeah, a tick softer should be better” was a good introduction to players who find the setup menu intimidating and confusing.Restarts – Originally, you had a credit reward if you used 5 or less restarts over the rally. Now you get 5 restarts and that’s it? Well, it would be but you can circumvent this by just quitting to the main menu and loading back in: rendering the restart limit pointless and creating needless tedium. Just bring back the credit bonus system and let the player decide if they want to limit restarts like in Dirt Rally.The Game Size – 107GB for everything which is nuts. I appreciate more content means more space, but this is the kind of size which would make Flight Sims blush. As the game expands and gets more complex, Codemasters should look into how they can optimise their file sizes for future releases.Thanks for reading my TED talk;Recommended;122.7;18/07/2020;189;N/I

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XIV Online;Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 52,99;Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*- What does this mean?If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different- What does this mean?There are two types of subscriptions. The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character- What does this mean?Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.;Recommended;2,709.4;29/05/2021;810;5

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XIV Online;Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 52,99;So I have bought this game on 05/25/17 and have been only playing this game till 06/04/2017 with an accumulate of 139 hours.Update: 06/22/2017 accumulated about 235 hours and I have payed a month of my Subscription :). I am reupdating this for the Summer Sale for people who want to try this game and also for the StormBlood DLC update. Updated 5.5:  09/06/2021 up to date with ShadowbringersPositive:-Completly Noob Friendly-Tons of Content with two DLC's (Heavensward 60)>(Stormblood 70)>(Shadowbringers 80)-Chocobo,Chocobo and Chocobo racing.-The brilliant soundtrack is very unique and captivating.-Multiple classes that this MMO is unique with is having 1 character and being able to switch classes- The one major thing that also makes this unique, is that in FFXIV, there is no rush in this game. You can be what you want to be and you are not forced to do anything else.Community:The community is amazing in certain perspectives that is actually more better than most MMO's. What makes this community so unique is just the cycle of players that are willing to help new players. Yes this is normal in all MMO's but in FFXIV we aren't forced to help new players but instead we choose to. That.s what makes this community so nice. Not all Communities are perfect or imperfect but the majority of this one is decently kind.Heavily Story Reliant: Most MMO's always fail to captivate the player of the story in general. FFXIV is very unique in it's own standpoint that the developers actually put so much development and depth into this story that just makes you enjoy it . Also being that this is probably the longest story in all Final Fantasy Genres. This is probably the only MMO that can potentially make you cry just from the story. That is how good it is.Dungeons/Trials/24 man raid/ Hardcore raids:Dungeons: Pretty generic even in this MMO that there isn't really much to say about honestly. Maps are very unique in it's own sense even the mobs and bosses with their unique skills. Though each map will have it's soundtrack included.Trials: Trials are Bosses that you will face during the Main story or a side quest. You will be with a party of 8 facing this trial. Every Trial is unique with it's own soundtrack. Though trials are not difficult, there are Trials:Extreme which increases the difficulties making it twice as hard.Alliance raids: 24 man raids are pretty much 24 players clearing a dungeon with multiple bosses. It's not difficult but you will die a lot. These 24 man raids also consists of the Nier raid in the most recent Shadowbringers update. Savage raids:These are your hardcore raids. They are about equivalent to Mythic raids in WoW. But, you are in a party of 8 of what you do is important. Everyone has to work together and synchronize too be able clear this content. The amount of time varies but in the most extreme hardcore raiders it can take them a 5-7 days to clear but for normal players it can take them 2-3 weeks.  There is also a 48 man savage content that released in the Eureka content.Ultimate raids: Thought savage was hard? There are currently 3 Ultimate raids. Ultimate raids make's savage content look like a joke. These are for the hardcore players that want to take it too the next level. Ultimate fights can last for about 15-18 minutes. Each passing second or minute, there is always a new mechanic that is very unique. This type of content take up to possibly more than 60+ hours. Being it can take you more than 1-3 months just to clear 1 ultimate. Though yes it's hard. But that is what makes this so much fun. The reward is that you will get a ultimate title and a unique ultimate weapon. But it's worth it.Graphics: Even with a Low end PC you can still run this game smoothly. For Medium-High End PC. A lot of people tend to not like this aesthetic of graphics because of the anime type graphics but it really seems to fit.Free Companies: Aka guilds- Finding a very dedicated FC that is willing to work with their own community is fun. Being able to host events and sometimes do raids and obtaining benefits makes FC's worth going to. Joining a FC or getting into the community can help you not get bored but can significantly make your FFXIV experience better.Enternal Bondings:  So this is basically a Marriage system that can help boost the XP gain of two of the couples are together in this game and a Chocobo and YES there are actual relationships between players but don't try to take it serious as a relationship game.Housing: You can have you're own house or a FC house that are limited in each server.  There are even crafters that can craft housing items or just be able to have you're own garden. You have your own section of an area where you would run into other players that could be your neighbor or another FC.Golden Saucer: Pretty much a land of Mini-games that has good decent amount of games to play like Chocobo Racing or Card games. People actually seem to enjoy this content that they sometimes live in it. They have unique glamours or mounts as rewards.Gear: Gears can be obtained from doing raids, dungeons or crafting. Every gear in this game unique. There are people who actually farm gear just for glamour that just looks really cool too be being very gorgeous or just very funny.Eureka: Pretty much Legendary weapons or armor that have their own signature look and stats that can be used for endgame content. This usually takes about 1-3 weeks to be able to obtain 1 weapon but can vary on the time.  They are very grindy content.Classes: You will have a single character with multiple classes to change into.So this means you do not need to make another character. There are 10 DPS, 4 Tanks, 3Healers, 7 Crafters, and 3 Gathers. Each job is very unique in terms of playstyle. You can be good with a specific class. But you will see a huge difference in terms of skill of the class you play too someone who plays the same class as you. This means even though you know your class. You haven't mastered it being there are rotations.Leveling: Leveling: Leveling can completely vary on the methods that players use. But it can probably take about 1- 3 weeks or maybe less to max a DPS/Healer/Tank class. For Crafters and Gathers it can take probably a few hours to 2 weeks that can vary. Leveling doesn't feel slow or fast. It's just very moderate.Crafters/gathering: Probably the most unique and yet rewarding content. There are tons of crafting recipes and gathering. Compared to other MMO's where Crafting and gathering are just sub-classes. In this game they can be a main class for players. Each crafter's are unique. Culinarian makes food for buffs even raids. Carpenter's can make housing materials. These are classes that can make you money and gear and being a crafter and gather is like playing a different game too where you can put infinite hours into this.Negatives:Monthly Payment: This is a subscription based MMO. But one thing in mind is that, if you do buy the steam version, you can purchase subscription with steam credits But this is how the game is still alive and healthy.The story length: You will feel beyond rushed. The story is good and it's amazing. But too other players they want to reach the endgame content. If you are the type of player that only wants to play endgame and do raids. Then this is probably the biggest.Conclusion:You are not forced to follow a linear path in this game. You can be what you want to be is what makes this game feel so alive. You can be a hardcore player or a casual but you are not forced. This game is started to become more mainstream now and it's always great to have new players. To be honest this game feels like WoW when it became popular when Wrath of the Litch King was released.(Not a hate rant). This game feels like it has more content than GW2 endgame. Both are amazing MMO's but, Final Fantasy 14 feels like the MMO that filled the void of my heart from what an MMO should be.Rating: 10/10;Recommended;6,392.1;5/06/2017;1,003;7
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XIV Online;Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 52,99;I feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we go. Tldr: It's great, the best mmo in my opinion out there. Good music, dungeons, story and awesome community. Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansion.Alright so let's start with the base and go up. A Real Reborn, the base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times. Quests that make you go fetch things from A to B, talk to this person etc. However, it still has some good points.     -The experience you get from doing the main story quests can keep you up to date for dungeon requirements. Some even give you gear so you don't need to throw your gil (In game currency) at the Market Board (player shop).    -Before the first dungeon you get the choice of having a tutorial on the basics of your current role (Tank, Healer or DPS.). Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does. The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30.   -When you reach lvl 20-ish it starts to open up its world by having you travel around the continent. This is where you get some world building lore, the struggles of each nation, how the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politics.    -It's beginner raids are new player friendly. Instead of having 8 people you have 4 which can be a good thing. There are other good points out there but I will let you decide on them. Now, with ARR done, let's give a look at what is to come. Spoiler free of course.    The first expansion, Heavensward, introduces new things to the fray like mechanics, locations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic. Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn. What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark Knight, Astrologian and Machinist. All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry level.   -Dark Knight: A tank class that is seen edgy due to its use of "inner darkness of your soul" but a fun one and useful.   - Astrologian: You use the stars and tarot cards to heal and buff your allies. Another fun class, especially if you enjoy multitasking.   -Machinist: A ranged physical dps that uses guns and turrets. It's fairly simple to play as and can get powerful later on. Heavensward is seen as one of the best of the currently 3 expansions because of its story and I am inclined to agree. After finishing A Real Reborn, Heavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved. But it does not end there.With Heavensward out of the way, Stormblood! Like before, it adds new mechanics and music along with two new areas, both having zones that you can enable flying in. With it comes 2 new classes this time, both DPS.   -Red Mage: Your fencer mage that uses both black and white magic to fight and support their allies. Heal and bring back your allies like a semi-healer in battles or focus on dealing damage while looking stylish! It's part of their persona.   -Samurai: Your sword wielding fighter from the Far East, which some of you might laugh at because of its name. Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damage.Stormblood is considered the good-ish one of the trio. I see it as an expansion that deviates a bit from the action of Heavensward and goes deeper in terms of other topics. And now, the latest expansion. Shadowbringers!This expansion was one that left many players with their mouth agaped, sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched. I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up. Things go to another level. As before, new zones with unlockable flying. Shadowbringers also brings to the fold 2 new classes: Gunbreaker and Dancer. A tank and a DPS.   -Gunbreaker: The small brother of Warrior that focuses on swift movements and big damage. It's skills are designed for fast gameplay, the player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering "Cartridges" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo. Confused? So was I but it comes around. A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target style.   -Dancer: It does what its name implies. With a combo that is half dependent on RNG, the dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partner, increasing both of their damage as the timer goes down. At later levels you can buff the party members around yourself, also increasing their damage. With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around them. Now for another part of this review. You have noticed that I have mentioned repeatedly that you can fly, yes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment! World Building! Each expansion gives the players new elements to the lore behind the universe of FFXIV. From the customs of each area and its people to civilizations long past to heroes of eld and gods once worshiped. The game introduces this through its story and many other quests. Questing! From Heanvensward and onward there is a trend that has been established with how the Main Quests work. It's pacing can be like this: First quest with the entry level is the introduction of the expansion followed by the next level being a dungeon you go in. The next quest can involve a solo instance where you fight along side NPC's in a revisited dungeon or a specially made area for it. And then another dungeon or trial. The cycle repeats like this to keep the player engaged and not go through another ARR slogfest.Music!The music is by far the best in my opinion. The composer, Masayoshi Soken, has a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content. From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert. Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself included. Community!It has been said a lot of times that the community of FFXIV is really welcoming and well mannered. I stand to agree to that but I won't let it be sugarcoated that much. We have problems like many other MMO's and games that have you play with real people have. If I would be correct to assume, the reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind. It's a paying forward sort of deal. At least that is how I see it.And that is all I can think of. If you have read this far, thank you for your time!

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XIV Online;Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 52,99;Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.!!Update!! 100 Hours more played later. Im completely addicted. Still have yet to hit the first expansion. Just content everywhere I look. I cant remember the last time I genuinely woke up or got home from work and was excited about actually sitting down continuing an adventure on a game or just to have pure fun and enjoyment. One of best communities I have had the pleasure of starting to be a part of as well. Experience is still amazing for me so far. And I know its just going to get better and better. Cant wait!!!Update!!Well i am currently sitting at 340 hours or so played now. Nothing has change I am loving this. I actually just hit the first expansion Heavensward and good lord they were not kidding. Dont get me wrong i didnt mind a realm reborn... but wow just wow did they step it up in the first expansion. the cut scenes the first new Main city i am obssessed and in love with and the music that comes along with it. Most of the cast from ARR has new voice actors and damn they are good. I just scratched the surface of Heavensward and with it already shocking me how good this is getting I cant even imagine Stormblood or Shadowbringers. I can honestly say even heavensward has put WoW shadowlands to shame in all terms of story especially and cut scenes even landscape and music its just overall beautiful and being the big game of thrones fan I am the dragons and all that feel to it is just great. Its definitely not a suprise why they add heavensward into the free trial because they know after you touch that expansion you wont want to stop! :) Overall Take it from Me a WoW 16 year vet even with a WoW tattoo irl on my arm i lived breathed and slept WoW. I have yet to even miss a single patch or anything. Even with 9.1 that just came out yesterday while sitting here playing this now. I dont even question myself for a single second about going back anytime soon or resubbing. I am having an overall amazing experience so far and it has been keeping me completely busy and satisfied. I can honestly say this is the very first game in my life that has kept me away from World of Warcraft and for me thats a huge statement and win.415 hours in or so. I should of easily been at Stormblood by now but i just keep getting side tracked into doing everything else in the game. Been leveling the Dark Knight up to 60 now and Finishing heavensward on him. Amazing class. Super fun story for the class as well. Machinest was my main until I recently started going Dark Knight crazy. The instant dungeon ques for tank are also a plus! And damn the Dark Knight gear just looks so good especially swinging around the big two hander feels so good as well. I should be hitting Stormblood soon though for sure as long as I dont get side tracked anymore. But honestly Im still genuinely happy and just having a blast playing this game honestly the longer it takes me to get to the other expansions the better. It is nothing like WoW where its just a strict grind fest as fast as you can to end game. Nah. Its just completely enjoy the game and have fun and do whatever you want and take your time!. Good stuff.!!Update!!Finally Finished Heavensward and Ill put this as simply and quick as I can. Amazing Story. Amazing Music. Just hooks you in and makes you connect with every character in the story it felt like I was just watching and getting to know every character like a full season of a show that just hooks you in. Some cutscenes were just an overall thrill and joy and by the end was hitting me in my feels haha. Simply just landed a spot in my top 10 stories of video games that I have experienced in my life.!!!!!UPDATE AGAIN!!!I am currently in the beginning stages of Stormblood still just chilling doing everything in the game and just having fun in general and damn the new Stormblood cities and music im in love lol.;Recommended;491.2;13/06/2021;823;17

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XIV Online;Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 52,99;I play MMOs. It's my thing. It's what I like to do. I've tried many. Most disappoint me. This one did not, as you can probably tell by my ever-increasing total playtime. The game most comparative to Final Fantasy 14 (FF14), to many people's annoyance, is World of Warcraft (WoW). They are both 'theme park' style MMOs, and they both use simple, action-based, 'TAB-targeting' combat. The similarities are vast, I can assure you, but they are also obvious. I can split hairs, talk about WoW's reactive, fast paced style versus FF14's slow, prepared style, but to anyone who has played both at the higher levels, it's fairly self-evident. The games are very similar as massively multiplayer online role-playing games, with simple mechanics and easy-to-enter natures (as well as raised cost-of-entries).I think one of the only things I can offer to the discussion involving this game is my perspective. I have experienced as many aspects of this game as I can. I played the story attentively, I watched every cutscene, I leveled a healer, tank and a dps to 80 (the current max), and I gathered and crafted for way too long. This is a weird game. The community is strange, in that they are as helpful as they are awkward. People will gladly help you for nothing, then ask that you visit them in their home (which is often just a hot tub next to a bed). They have odd customs, like saying 'o7' at the start of dungeons (which is supposed to be a salute). Everyone cares how they look, but doesn't care what you think about how they look. Playing songs in the plazas, erotic roleplay in the alleys, and bots asking you to buy gil are common sights. The story is set into whats called the Main Scenario, split by expansion. You have to play through all the present and past story to catch up. This is incredibly time consuming. If you play like I did over the last year, it is unlikely you can get to Shadowbringers (the current expansion) within one month of game time. Luckily, the free trial is extremely good now. They recently changed it to be that you can play through the initial release content (A Realm Reborn), all for free, forever. Speaking of A Realm Reborn (ARR), it's painfully average. The story is as well paced as paint drying, and because of the way item/level scaling works, there is no meaningful challenges. Granted, there aren't supposed to be, but it is disappointing. The plot comes to a grinding halt a number of times, and sometimes there isn't even a plot, just you doing weird, forgettable jobs for weird, forgettable people. If you tried this game and left because of how slow ARR is, I can't blame you. It's a slog. But if you stick around, the last arc of ARR was relatively enjoyable, finally arriving at some of the crazy style Final Fantasy is more known for. After ARR, (and after you pay for the game), comes Heavensward (HW), the Wrath of the Lich King of this game. I cannot express to you how surprised I was by the sharp quality increase here. It's remarkable. The story picks up in a new kingdom, dropping most of the old characters for a story about an oncoming dragon war, set in a genuinely interesting nation. The first time I truly took notice of the music in FF14 was when I entered this expansion, it's phenomenal, and consistently so throughout. The quests become stripped of tedious 'Slay 10 _', and are paced very well, keeping a feeling of tension as you progress that was never present in ARR. If you've ever heard someone say 'stick around FF14, it gets good', this is why. Unfortunately, it is followed by...Stormblood (SB). If Heavensward is like WotLK, then Stormblood is like Warlords of Draenor. Everything I just praised HW for took several steps back during this story. Old characters are brought to the light screaming and kicking, some given literal rewrites to force them to fit in, and newer characters struggle to make an impact. The music fails to keep me engaged as well, matching equally uninteresting environments Plots are jump-started, then the brakes are cut as they tumble down a hill. While the questing is still better than ARR, it's not by much anymore. The truly cool moments are so few and far between a deep, deep ocean of truly unfulfilling questing. It's really unfortunate, I really liked a few of the characters they introduce here, and 2 of the zones they introduce are among the best the game has, with a small plot about a rebellion I truly enjoyed. Those aspects are just mashed inside of a larger, more boring plot about a different rebellion.Fortunately for me, Shadowbringers (ShB) was everything I hoped for. If HW is WotLK, and SB is WoD, than Shadowbringers is, I guess, kind of like Legion. Honestly, the WoW expansion comparisons start to break down here. If you are looking into this game, at some point you probably heard that Shadowbringers is good. You probably also have some healthy skepticism and some tempered expectations. I'm here to assure you that Shadowbringers is not so good that it's worth playing through all of what I just described, AND a $60+ price tag. But it's pretty close. This expansions reworks a lot of old characters and plots into a surprisingly touching and insightful story, making one of the most trite and lifeless antagonistic forces in the game into strangely sympathetic villains. The themes through the story are strong, and conveyed in honestly intuitive ways. The music is unbelievably good. One or two areas have some weaker themes, but the dungeons and raids have absolutely stunning scores. The area designs are lacking, in my opinion, but they are easy to traverse, and, well, it's very subjective. A few closing remarks, organized in no particular order.The class design and feel is pretty good. Each class feels very distinct, and the meta is tight, with, and I know this is hard to believe, every class performing well. It's very well balanced on the PvE side.The PvP in this game is, and this is being generous, awful. It's poorly balanced, it's map design is shoddy, and it's not very rewarding in terms of character progression, if at all. It can be fun in short doses because it is chaotic, but playing it anymore than that is frustrating. The fashion in FF14 is one of the main aspects of the players who stick around. It's easy to track down what you want, and there is a wide variety of styles to pursue.The cash shop, also known as the Mogstation, is quite prevalent. Not in the sense that you are forced to visit it, or that you have to to get an advantage, just that many, many people use it. Premium costumes and emotes are frequent, as well as sales. It doesn't bother me much, but I mention it because it can be annoying to see someone wearing a cool set, only to discover it cost them $12. The account management is awful. The website to manage your subscription and account details is ancient, slow, and prone to problems. The customer support as well is slow, but I have found them to be at the very least helpful and patient. Also...The Steam version of this game is prone to account issues. I recommend the stand-alone version (which actually goes on sale more often). It's too late for me in this regard.All and all, I find Final Fantasy XIV a rewarding way to waste my time. I often find myself just standing in places, talking with my friends and/or strangers I happen to meet in-game. I recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxed MMO with a flair for the dramatic.;Recommended;4,184.5;26/01/2021;286;2

Up to 2000 hours easily.+ An MMO that starts simple, looks appealing and raises the difficulty in later levels.+ Dungeons, bosses and raids look amazing, featuring rich details and lots of effects.+ Community is very social and they enjoy helping other players in anything they need.+ Party finder for those lacking a party going solo, as well as other features to keep players together and make it easy to connect.-  Monthly subscription can repel new players.- Lots of content to do in order to catch up with the latest expansions.- Early parts of the game can be quite dull and boring, though it gets much better.- The duties which are solo instances can break a party temporally and be bothersome.- Later in the game, it becomes a trial and error experience when battling new bosses and exploring new dungeons. Introduction Final Fantasy XIV is an MMO game base on the series with the same name. It features elements from all the entries and creates a huge world filled with lots of things to do. What set it apart from other MMO’s is that it looks visually appealing, that its system is easy to learn but hard to master and that it has a lot of versatility when it comes to its players. It is a fluid system with a good amount of room to explore and take it easy. Gameplay The gameplay features common elements of what an MMO would have. Players do quests in order to gain exp and level up, once they do they are able to queue up for dungeons, trials(bosses) and raids which they can battle together with friends or with other players through the party finder, which works like a charm.Each player is required to choose a class, then at lv 30, that class will become a job. Job is a more specialized class. Depending on the class the player chooses, gameplay will vary and while it would be impossible to mention all of them in a review, I will give some examples. Classes are divided into three roles: Healers Their job is to keep their fellow peers alive through the art of healing. They can range from the classic white mage with lots of healing spells, to a more offensive approach with the scholar who has damaging spells. Players can also opt to get a mix of both with astrologian, which depends on the high skill of the player and some RGN but features the higher arrange of abilities. DPS (Damage dealers) They are the ones who kill the monsters. DPS is the role with more classes in the game and they feature different types of jobs such as black mages, which enjoy lots of damaging spells but lack utility, to bards who can buff their whole party with beneficial effects while keeping up damage or ninjas, who mix different kinds of abilities to generate powerful ninjutsu. Tanks The heart of the party, they always must protect their fragile party members and be the shield that guards the realm of men. Like their description says, they keep everyone out of harm's way by provoking monster, rushing to deploy barriers or just being a pain for bosses to get rid of in general. Tanks will redirect all the damage towards them so that the healers and dps’s can do their jobs without preoccupying about dying.Is the mix of all these roles that create a functioning party, and with the finder, you are always guaranteed to get a good balance of all of them. Each of these roles is equally important as they are pieces of a greater whole. The healers keep everyone alive, the DPS kills the enemies and the tanks keep the other two out of harm's way. No matter which role you choose, you will always be important for your party.Speaking of side activities, there is another type of roles I haven’t mentioned yet. These are the disciples of the hand and the disciples of the hand. In these fields, players can find classes ranging from blacksmiths to fishermen or even culinarian! These jobs tend to break the normal pace of the game and offer a more relaxing environment. They might sound boring at first, but players often find themselves lost in them for hours. Once you get going, you just want to do more, and they are beneficial to yourself and your other classes.If you are a culinarian, for example, you can make your own food which allows you to get bonus exp modifiers. If you are a blacksmith or an armorer, you can craft your own weapons and armors to use in your other classes. If you are a fisherman, you can sell the fish for lots of money on the player market and well, who doesn’t love fishing in a game? Story Final Fantasy XIV is a game that takes its story very personal and treats it with the utmost care. It does start pretty boring and dull but catches up fast and it can feel like watching a series or a movie. The richest stories are in the expansions, unfortunately, but these are quite enjoyable, filled with lots of believable characters, conflicts, development and more. Reading all of it or catching up to the latest expansions can be quite daunting, so if you are not into spending a lot of time reading/watching cutscenes, you can always skip them and rewatch them later at an inn’s room. There are also plenty of summaries only that are well written and consist of thirty to an hour reading material per expansion (game+2 expansions= 3 hours of reading total) so feel free to skip it if you do find it boring or exhausting to sit through. Do however note that the story is one of the strongest points of the game. Some Notes The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. Some areas might decrease your fps depending on your settings and the sheer amount of player characters that are present in the zone but fret not, this is not a big issue by any means. Duties can be bothersome when you are at a party with friends but are overall enjoyable. Probably the easiest MMO to get into has a UI that the player can adjust to fit their playstyle or needs and the game lacks any sort of pay to win or in-game advantage bought with real money, only shortcuts for those that simply don’t have a lot of time. What Makes It Special What makes Final Fantasy XIV special is that it is well balanced when it comes to all the classes and jobs. That it looks more realistic when compared to its peers and that it features a dynamic, fluent system with that is easy to use but hard to master. By sharing all classes across one character, the player will never need to go back to the start of the game in they decide that maybe that class they picked, in the beginning, wasn’t the one for them. The game makes an effort to make fights different from one another. Players can find themselves fighting in Rubik's cube, getting devours by a Cerberus and fighting the beast from its stomach or even getting split from their bodies and have to move across a labyrinth of AOE’s in order to go back into them and continue the fight. There is always something new in waiting for the player in the next encounter.  Conclusion Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMO, it is filled with great amounts of content and different ice breakers to teach new players how to play and hold their hands until they can go by themselves into the wild worlds of Eorzea. There are a bunch of side activities to break the normal pace of the game and have some fun if you are ever tired from questing, and each dungeon or trial keep adding new mechanics, keeping the game entertaining and making you wonder what you will encounter in your next adventure. I recommend this game to those that haven’t experienced an MMO, and to those that have as well.Follow our curator page, Alexander's Club Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/quote;Recommended;1,859.4;12/06/2019;328;29

It is not obvious at first, but nearing the end of a few chapters you'll notice that some characters refer to a thing in particular, hinting at what's coming after you finish all chapters: the real ending. Once you finish all 32 of them, don't uninstall OT right away. Google how to find the post-game dungeon, THAT is the real ending. It's a shame that only 5,8% of the players experienced it, as the achievement indicates.

Square Enix;Octopath Traveler;RPG;R$ 226,99;After spending more than 200 hours with Octopath Traveler across Switch and PC, scrutinizing it in an objective fashion was an uncomfortable prospect because it's one of my favorite games. however, in doing so, the conclusion is Octopath Traveler is more a solid proof of concept than a masterpiece, with ample room for improvement in a sequel. For every aspect in which it excels, another is middle-of-the-road. for every system with respectable depth, another is a puddle, so it's only fair they're given equal weight.In a relatively uncommon move for the genre, rather than focus wholly on an overarching story about saving the world from Big Evil, Octopath follows the individual journeys of eight characters with wildly different personalities and goals through their personal struggles and triumphs, large and small. While this can initially feel like a breath of fresh air, some players will find it difficult to maintain interest in the ordinary and mundane lives of everyday heroes, and I suspect many will fail to see all eight of them through to the end.Dialogue is only partially voiced and can best be described as serviceable, and cutscenes tend to drag on a bit too long because of unnatural pauses.It makes conversation stiff and dull. This is amplified by the fact you'll be expecting the next line to be voiced, but it's a coin toss whether it actually will be or not. The content of the characters' stories is fairly well-written so it's a shame the temptation to skip cutscenes is likely to grow with each passing chapter.The world in Octopath Traveler is totally non-linear: you may begin your journey as whomever you wish, go wherever you'd like—even dangerous places you've no business yet—and recruit other characters as you see fit up to a party of four. Members can be switched out at any time within taverns, except for your main character who cannot be removed until you finish chapter four of their personal story. This will be well into the game, so ensure you set out on your journey with a character you want to keep around.Besides their easily distinguished identities, each character is also intended to have "path actions" unique to them which can be used on NPCs outside of combat. two do in fact boast unique abilities but the other six unfortunately overlap significantly. Therion, the brooding thief who trusts no one due to the lingering trauma of past betrayals, is the only character who can steal from NPCs or pick the locks on purple chests littered throughout the world—invaluable. Tressa, an intrepid merchant from a quaint seaside village, is the only character who can purchase certain items which can't be stolen from NPCs.As for the other six: Ophelia, the cleric, can guide villagers, convincing them to join you temporarily and allowing you to call upon them to aid you in battle. So can Primrose, the dancer—the ability is just named allure instead of guide. The same goes for challenging NPCs to a duel with warrior Olberic or provoking them into it with hunter H'aanit. scrutinizing them for information and secrets with Cyrus the scholar or instead inquiring nicely with Alfyn the apothecary.The overlap in path actions means you can generally take either choice in a pair and be no worse off from lacking the alternative. their class is ultimately of little consequence because of a job system in which any character can learn the non-path class skills of another once you've visited the appropriate shrine. This makes some characters feel like must-haves and others interchangeable, which somewhat ruins the tough party composition decisions you'd need to make if every character was awesome in their own way. At the same time, it offers a great deal of freedom in building your perfect party.Homogenization of what characters can offer is furthered by investing in the admittedly wonderful job system: Each character can take on a second class and unlock its skills using job points earned from battle. as new class skills are unlocked, passive skills from that class will also be unlocked and each character can equip four of those at once, from any class(es) in which they've trained. Technically, every character can know every ability and passive from every single class, though they can only have one additional job at a time, and two characters can't equip the same second class simultaneously.Identifying and exploiting enemy weaknesses is at the core of combat in Octopath: There are six weapon types and six element types in the game and enemies are typically vulnerable to several, though you won't know to which until you use that attack type on them for the first time. Striking an enemy with a weapon or element they're weak against will bring down their shield counter and eventually "break" them, causing them to be stunned for the next round and take additional damage from attacks in the meantime. Some bosses will shift weaknesses after recovering from a break, or have them grayed out until certain conditions are met.Boost points (BP) help to keep combat interesting and balanced. each character begins battle with one BP and can hold a maximum of five. For each turn you don't spend BP, you'll gain one on the next turn, and you can use up to three at once to boost the magnitude of abilities. The most expensive class-exclusive skills, called divine skills, can only be triggered when fully boosted and have especially powerful effects, such as doubling a character's actions for a few rounds or causing spells to affect all characters instead of just one. The BP system adds a much-needed element of strategy and resource management to battles.If you're a fan of Octopath's graphical style, it's gorgeous. if you're not, the effects you would've been stuck with on Switch, such as heavy depth of field from a tilt shift effect, can be disabled by mods which can be found on the Steam forums. Other than those effects, what you see in the screenshots is what you get.The game's flawed dualities go on and on and prevent much from being exceptional. Although the eight regions have distinct biomes and there's great graphical variety throughout the world and its combat backgrounds, every area has essentially one thoroughfare with many short, dead-end paths branching off that lead to treasure chests before sending you back. there are few real secrets, puzzles, or anything out of the ordinary to break up that pattern.In the same way, there are seemingly hundreds of beautifully drawn enemies but many are merely re-skins in another of the six elements, or doppelgängers possessing only a different color palette and another set of weaknesses. Many enemies, even if completely different from one another, are effectively the same.Finally, while there are three villages in each region and a seemingly great number of places to explore, they begin to feel like hubs for picking up a few quests then robbing and interrogating NPCs who feel like fleshy treasure chests more than living beings. Save for the few lucky enough to be quest givers, this isn't helped by the line or two of dialogue they've been given straight out of a generic 1990s JRPG.If there's one thing anyone can appreciate about Octopath Traveler, it's the soundtrack: not only does each region, character, and story-related battle have its own theme with motifs that tie into one another, the composition, instrumentation, and variety is impeccable. This is one of the very few games that prominently features a variety of real woodwind instruments. The  soundtrack is no small part of why this is one of my personal favorites so, even if you don't end up playing the game, consider listening to it elsewhere.Overall, Octopath Traveler succeeds in enjoyably modernizing the archaic more than it fails, and new IPs willing to stand out and take risks while trying to bring back something once beloved deserve a bit of leniency—it's a good game that will hopefully achieve greatness in the next installment.;Recommended;104.4;11/01/2020;208;5

Square Enix;Octopath Traveler;RPG;R$ 226,99;My feelings on Octopath Traveller are certainly mixed. If you asked me if I would recommend the game at the halfway-point, I would have said no.But after playing through everything the game had to offer, I have to give this game a positive review.Mechanically, this is a very good RPG. The combat system, path actions, item/stats progression are well designed.Graphically this game is unique in its own way, as you can see in the screenshots. The lighting is exceptionally good.The story is my main point of concern. While being very good overall, it is designed in a such a weird way that it had trouble sucking me in.The stories you witness while following the 8 party members are, each on their own, good but rather small storylines. Yet, as hoped, each of these 8 stories hint to the greater plot behind the scenes.This builds curiosity towards the bigger world lore and anticipation towards the great big confrontation that is often hinted at.However, due to the level requirements of each characters' chapters, it is hard to become fully engaged in any story. Finishing all chapters 2 of each character can easily take you up to 30 hours play time.Then the repetitiveness becomes apparent: Every character has 4 chapters. After a while you start to realize that each chapter is structured in the same way.- You get a recap of the characters story- You get some new story- You run a dungeon- You fight a boss- You get a conclusion and/or a setup for the next chapterThis does get kinda repetitive doing it 32 times.After finishing all chapters of every character, I was hungry for the final big confrontation where all the stories finally intertwine... But even after seeing the credits and hoping for a "final chapter", nothing came.Thankfully, the steam achievements showed me that there is indeed a final boss somewhere.Having to use google, i found out that there are 2 certain questlines of (random) sidequests that you have to complete before you can finally face the real final boss.There it all finally comes to a big climax and the game, in hindsight, also succeeded on bringing a great story, even if I think they could have gone about it in a better way.;Recommended;92.0;26/11/2021;121;N/I
Square Enix;Octopath Traveler;RPG;R$ 226,99;square enix turn-based jrpg. you know what you signed up for when you buy this game. let's get straight to the point. like: + 2.5D works super well and is a refreshing sight for a game that's supposed to be old-school. the sprite work is amazing and my god the effects are pretty. definitely the pinnacle of aesthetic of this kind+ sound design plus the OST are absolutely top tier. your footsteps echo in the cave and you can hear the stream flowing in the distance. again pushing the standards for this kind of game+ solid combat system. everything is labelled clearly and it's never confusing what you can or can't do during a fight+ the main cast. i liked all 8 main characters and especially enjoyed the fact that you are allowed to choose your 'main' at the beginning. choice is good. (you get the option to swap your main out down the line dw about it)+ voice acting. the cutscenes are already well animated and the VA made them shine. although not every scene is VA'd, the ones that are are never boring to sit through+ design for all the available jobs in game. each of them fill a niche (dps, aoe break, buffs/debuffs, healing...) and each character can equip up to two, encouraging diverse builds+ honorable mention to the fact that most elemental spells in this game are aoe. makes grinding super easy and painless when you can just rip it and screenwipe... thank godthe thing is, if you look at this game objectively, it's not like this game tries to reinvent the wheel. you can definitely see the 'square enix-ness' of the story and character design. however what i really appreciated was the fact that they decided to take what they know, and present them in a modern, fresh way. "2D old school turn-based jrpg" screams ancient but this game is anything but. that being said...ehh:- i personally didn't mind it, but after the first few hours one can definitely tell the 'formula' of the game progression. go to new place, talk to everyone in town, cutscene, dungeon, boss, back to town, go to new place... you get the gist. "that's all jrpgs" but this one especially more so with their formula. definitely can feel 'same-y' after a few loops of this and might need a break to recharge- some character/job combo are definitely more OP than the rest, to the point that some may feel obligated to follow the 'meta'. tressa/runelord is just so extremely powerful that it feels like a tressa-only job. this is a single player jrpg though so you CAN avoid playing the meta but it's there for you to take advantage of- completionist's hell. most achievement are easily done by just simply playing through the game (side note: these are the most spoiler-y achievement i've ever seen in my life holy balls how hard is it to just say "cleared character chapter x" LOL), but the last few achievements... dear lord almost feels like they DON'T want you to get them. solo traveler, speedrun, all items/hidden items/enemy weakness/chests/locations... oh did i mention that there are missables in this game? multiple playthroughs are required if you want to actually 100% the game, obviously not a problem if you are happy with the one playthrough you do- speaking of a good jrpg time, without spoilers, the optional superboss is kind of a tedious design. you need to do a 8-boss rush (dw by the time you get there they're a cakewalk) before you can challenge it... but get this, not only can you not leave after going in, you can't save your game either. meaning every time you lose to this boss you have to go through the boss rush AGAIN, which is just an arbituary time sink for... no good reason? i personally only did the rush twice and that was already tiring. oh yeah by the way you also have to use all 8 of your characters in the fight, so good luck people who only have 4 of them levelled and geared. it's doable, but very very tight. this is at the tail end of the game though, so you have plenty of time to build up before tackling this - to add onto the point above... imo a good 97% of this game is easy, outside of the one(1) superboss. if you want a teeth-grinding fist-tight hardcore rpg action, this game might not be for you. xp gain isn't painful in this game and you can easily outscale the game even without grinding. i downed the superboss with characters that aren't even lv50it took me around 68 hours to beat the final chapter for all characters and then some for sidequest and superboss. for the most part, you will definitely get your money's worth on this game if you are craving that square enix jrpg goodness. if you WANT to get into jrpgs, well, this is a pretty good game for a first-timer too.;Recommended;80.7;10/03/2022;122;4
Square Enix;Octopath Traveler;RPG;R$ 226,99;This game is EXTREMELY slow to start.There's a huge difference in gameplay the moment you assemble a 4-man party, and then another huge mix-up when you unlock sub-classes.If you didn't know about any of these features beforehand then you might've quit the game quite early.Once you obtain these mechanics though, the game picks up. Team composition becomes deep. New strategies become available. It's like a whole new game and you'll start to enjoy yourself.If you're a player who will read anything and everything then you'll appreciate the sheer amount of work the developers put into loading the world with dialogue and context clues. When you hear people complain about the lack of story, it's because the premise of each character's story is shallow.The characters you play aren't the centre of a cataclysmic event, but rather are dealing with their own problems in an extremely well fleshed-out world.Most of the narrative is told outside of the main chapters, and by collecting all the little bits of context the game throws at you, you can start to see how everything fits together.;Recommended;88.7;23/04/2021;106;N/I

Square Enix;Octopath Traveler;RPG;R$ 226,99;Pros 👍🏻Cons 👎🏻 Simple combat system Great soundtrack Long game length  Beautiful pixel art graphics Takes a while to 'catch on' to the game Characters rarely interconnect  Bad mini-map design A lot of grinding Like our reviews? Check out: United Critics!🎮 GameplayIn OCTOPATH TRAVELER, you begin your journey by choosing one of the eight playable characters. No matter which one you choose, the game will still start and play out the same. you will just start the game by completing the first chapter of your selected character. The game is separated into eight stories, each one containing four 'chapters'. You can choose which stories/chapters you want to complete first. as there is no order you need to follow, and each story has a respective character.  Sadly, characters will never interact in each other's stories, other than the sparse travel banter.The in-game world is quite large and contains several different locations for you to explore. Upon entering a town, you will be able to visit some important buildings, as well as being able to quick travel to that town in the future. This makes it much easier to travel to where you need to be in the later chapters.To start a character's chapter, you must have them currently assigned in your party. When you enter a town you will be prompted to continue a character's story and you may either continue it or choose to continue another time.In the many towns you will venture to, there are plenty of things to do within. You can purchase items at the provision shop or weapons/armor from the weapon shop that will greatly assist you while battling.While in towns, you will have the option to complete side-quests, for which you will be rewarded. A side quest is marked by the orange star on the mini-map. When you confront an NPC with a speech bubble, you may notice some white icons. These are known as 'path actions', and are a character's special ability. Simply press J and select which path action you wish to take. Depending on your current party, different abilities will be available to use.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2091593079⚔ CombatOCTOPATH TRAVELER uses a turn based combat system when it comes to fighting enemies. While wondering through any non-town map area, you have the chance to enter into battle. The screen will fade black, and then clear into a battle scene, where the enemies are on the left, and the characters on the right. The turn order bar is shown at the top of the screen, and the current attacking enemy or character is shown on the left of the bar, followed by the next attackers. Each character has three main stats: health points (HP), skill points (SP), and battle points (BP). HP determines how much damage a character can take before becoming incapacitated.When you start a battle, you will begin with one BP. BP is depicted by a little gold circle under a character's name. You can use BP to double, triple or quadriple an attack (one BP for x2, two BP for x3 etc.). SP is needed to use a character's skill abilities, which offer stronger elemental physical and non-physical attacks. Character skills can be unlocked by spending 'job points' (JP) in the skills tab of the menu. Unlocking will grant access to more skills and support skills - which are certain benefits not affected by equipped weapons/armor or status ailments. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2083983370All enemies have little boxes displayed under their names with a question mark inside. These are undiscovered monster vulnerabilities, and by attacking with different weapons or elements, you can reveal different weaknesses. Whenever you make an attack that the monster is vulnerable against. you will deal extra damage as well as reducing a monster's defense (illustrated by blue shield icon) by one. When you deplete a monster's defense to zero, you will 'break' their defense and they will become stunned and lose a turn. During this time, all attacks will deal more damage.Status ailments can cause positive and negative effects on enemies or allies, and can be acquired through random chance or apothecary skills and item usage. A status ailment may last a number of turns. Degrading ailments such as poison take effect after each characters turn.After battle, your characters will gain XP to increase level. When entering the final chapters of the game, 'grinding' battles to level up characters to make them strong enough to continue becomes a necessity. For most - including me - this is a very dull and boring part of the game, but the soundtrack enhances the experience to make it 'bearable' enough to continue.💻 GraphicsOCTOPATH TRAVELER uses pixel art graphics known as 'HD-2D' to give the game a retro NES look while remaining visually appealing to the modern age. The game is very easy on the eyes. and the pixel-like art is colorful and crisp.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2083983250🎶 AudioA key component of OCTOPATH TRAVELER are the multiple in-game soundtracks. A soundtrack will always be playing while in-game, whether you are exploring a town, battling monsters or wandering around the map. Overall, I'd say the music has been very well made, and even the best music I've heard. The soundtrack creates a more involving and invigorating experience while in battle, and makes you enjoy battle scenes a lot more.While most of the game characters don't speak, when they do, they sound great! They really add a much needed part of the game, and creates a much better story-telling experience.👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 AudienceThis game is great for anyone who enjoys old-style RPGs, or just pixel art in general. To enjoy playing, you'd need a little patience to let the stories play out, as well as the many and sometimes long battles.🔥 PerformanceThe game was played well on my system setup with video settings set to high:Operating system: Windows 10 ProProcessor: Ryzen 3 2200G @3.5/3.7GHzGraphics Card: GALAX GeForce® GTX 1650 Super EX 4GBMemory: 16GB DDR4 @2666HtzDisplay: 1920x1080 @60HtzStorage: 480GB SSDI achieved 60FPS at all times, albeit dropping when moving from one part of the map to another.❓ ConclusionOCTOPATH TRAVELER is a well-made pixel art JRPG with eight well structured stories. I recommend definitely playing, but for a lot of people the high price is a negative factor. For the amount of content this game provides (around 100 hours in one playthrough), I view it as a fair price for the game. If you aren't looking to pay full price, wishlist the game and wait for the next 50% off sale.Like our reviews? Check out: United Critics!;Recommended;50.1;10/05/2020;141;5
Square Enix;Dragon Quest XI;Adventure, RPG;None;Graphically, it's a slight downgrade from the original as it's a port of the Nintendo Switch version. However, it still looks  and plays better than the Nintendo Switch version as you're getting a higher resolution and an unlocked frame rate.I'd recommend getting this on Xbox Game Pass if you bought the original and want to save money. I agree this should have been a free upgrade for those that bought the original.;Recommended;1.6;4/12/2020;506;6
Square Enix;Dragon Quest XI;Adventure, RPG;None;I was pretty sceptical at first. The characters seemed bland and the story seemed to nothing special by any means.The story later got actually very engaging with quite a few unexpected turns. I never would have guessed how the story ended. This is a LONG game, you should be prepared for that. This is a long adventures journey that will take lots of your time to finish. Around 60h in I was hoping the game would finally end because I was burned out from it. When I was 80h in I was actually surprised of how interesting the story got, that when I finished it with around 102h I was actually kind of sad it ended.The Gameplay is your classical turn based Dragon Quest Fighting System, but refined to modern standarts. It might be to this day the best turn based game I have played.The graphics I shoudn´t even have to mention if you saw a screenshot, they are absolutely fantastic. The Lighting really brings everything home. 10/10The music while beautifully orchestrated was very exhausting. There are VERY few tracks in this game and they keep playing over and over. Luckily in this version they addded the option to instead use the DQVIII Soundtrack and one can even change both Soundtracks to a bit version if wanted. (Awesome Feature, I do have to say)Then in this version there is the option to play the entire game in a 2D pixelated version. You heard right. You can switch between these modes whenever you want. Kind of insane how much work the devs did for this game, I really have to praise them for it.If you like Dragon Quest this game is a no brainer. If you didn´t like them in the past, this one might actually still be interesting for you. So it comes down to whether you like turn based JRPG´s and are ready to spend at least 70-80h into a game. Overall I can absolutely recommend this game. it is, dispite its flaws, quite honestly probably one of the best JRPG´s ever made.;Recommended;143.4;4/03/2021;129;N/I

Square Enix;Dragon Quest XI;Adventure, RPG;None;Acts 1 & 2 are 9/10 nearly perfect. The story reuses some of the great storytelling themes that Square is known for, but it does it quite well. If you've played other Square games, you'll recognize where it's retelling a similar story as a past Square game. But they do it well. It's an homage to those games, it's tastefully done, and while not QUITE as good as the original, it's still the right mix of nostalgia, good storytelling, and a fun game.At the end of Act 2, there's a point where you have to choose to put down the controller. You have a very clear chance to say "I'm done, I've beaten this game, the next step is clearly something I don't want to do". Stop there. If you are a "story" gaming person, that's where the game ends for you. You beat the game, there's nothing left.Act 3 is fun if you like mechanics, completing lists, and achievements. I did not like the story of Act 3. It was fun to get all the recipes, build all the items, do all the quests, get Lv 99, beat some optional super-bosses, etc. But, it's all undercut by a BBEG that... isn't really doing anything, and you are undoing all the great story points in the previous acts.There are no missables. If you are a completionist, then you can find and do and finish everything you want to do to 100% complete the game in Act 3. It's fun... It's not a massive chore or grind like a lot of games do for that. But... it's definitely not as impactful or fun as Acts 1 & 2. Once you're in Act 3, you're much more "playing a game" than "participating in an epic story". It's not bad, but it's just not as good.;Recommended;145.1;23/02/2023;74;2
Square Enix;Dragon Quest XI;Adventure, RPG;None;Do you remember DragonQuest VIII? Did you absolutely love it? If yes to both, then hey, BUYTHISGAME! For more details, see below. If you said no to any of the above, my review isn't really geared towards you, so it likely won't be helpful for you.So, this game is the DQ game we've been wanting since we all played 8 and forgot what it means to eat, shower and sleep...only without the things that sort of sucked about 8. Hated that slow walk? Guess what, you can run in this game!!! Hated grinding on metal enemies? Guess what!? Killing metal enemies in this game is MUCH easier!! Hated the *ridiculous* amount of exp it took to level up? [Seriously, who the hell ever reached level 99 without cheats? Anyone?] Guess what!?!?! Exp required to level up over the course of the game isn't a straight vertical line. In fact, reaching level 99 [not necessary of course] is pretty easy, and not a ton of time required! Will you spend as much time with this title as you did with 8? Probably, but the real joy is that half of your logged hours won't be time spent grinding! That's all I really want to say. I don't wanna get into specifics about how to kill the metal slimes. I'm sure you'll figure it out, my fellow Dragonquesters. And fear not, the post game will rock your world once more.

Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;I like to think I'm a patient person, and I've waited a month to post this negative review. I honestly regret not doing it sooner. I waited because the game is genuinely fun to play, but at this point the issues are a lead weight on the other side of the scale. I can say that with 134 hours, I've gotten my $60 out of this game, but I had to actually "try" to get that value. By the time I was totally fed up, I was outside the refund window, so I kept going to get my money’s worth.Pros:1. When the game works, the gameplay is stellar. The blending of shooting and ability use throughout combat works really well. It is also visually entertaining.2. There is a lot of build customization available between your abilities, skill tree, and the mods you select on your gear. There is plenty to tinker with and you should easily be able to find a playstyle that will be fun for you specifically.3. All the classes are at least entertaining to play. Like every game, they aren't perfectly balanced against each other, but all classes can do all activities with varying levels of effort.4. The story kept me engaged. There was clearly a solid effort put into it. Not award winning, but not everything can be. The campaign with all the side quests completed, took me about 30 hours. It would probably have been a lot quicker if I didn’t raise the difficulty every time a new World Tier was unlocked. Between the campaign and the endgame content, I think there is enough here.Cons: This section is going to get salty. This game has so much potential that got blown here.1. The game, even in single player, is ONLINE ONLY. At the time of writing, the store page says that persistent online access is required for the demo, nowhere does it says this for the core game. This decision appears to be the source of much of the game's greatest failings. There has been a running joke since launch that the sign in screen is the greatest boss in the game, because you can't connect to the servers, or you may just have to wait 20 minutes to sign in. Getting disconnected from the servers multiple times a game session have been a constant issue, something I don’t have in any other game online. There is NO EXCUSE FOR THIS BEING AN ISSUE PLAYING SINGLE PLAYER, but we have to always be online for no reason.2. Adjacent to the online only issue, the game is peer to peer, and as usual that has turned out horribly. No matter if I’m playing with randoms online or friends who are in the same town, if you’re not the host, you’re gonna have a bad time. Since not only do you now need to connect with whatever toaster at PCF you need to for single player, but now you have to remain constantly connected to the host player as well. This results in ability cooldowns failing, weapon and armor affixes failing, and of course lag. If I had a nickel for every time I got stuck for 3 seconds after using Gravity Leap, I would have paid off the $60 for this game.3. Major bugs upon bugs. Only the major ones are listed here, these alone should be damning enough that minor bugs shouldn’t matter.3A. I have never played a game that crashes this often. Sometimes it might take a few hours, other times I get 4 crashes in an hour. After a crash the game decides to create a crash data dumb folder on my OS SSD, despite the game being located on my much larger hard drive. I've deleted 10 gb of crash files twice.3B. We had character and stash inventory wipes caused during multiplayer since launch, and it was a continuing issue for weeks. People Can Fly (PCF) deployed a "fix", THAT MADE IT ALSO OCCUR IN SINGLE PLAYER. It appears that further wipes have since been stopped, but it took weeks for an actual fix that didn’t make things worse to be deployed. Effected characters are still entirely unplayable. PCF says that this is intentional to prevent further save corruption as they are allegedly working on limited item restoration of effected characters. The game has been out for a month and we are still waiting. Honestly I expect them to say that they actually can't find a way to do that.3C. In the latest update to the game on April 30th, they "fixed" a bugged mod that should only apply a massive damage mitigation boost at 30% hp, but instead was actually operating constantly. In doing so, they managed to break damage mitigation FOR THE ENTIRE GAME. No matter how much resist you have, sometimes the damage mitigation has zero effect. And you’re not just getting one shot because mitigation no longer works. there is also supposed to be a hard stop point at 30% hp preventing one shots in general, that no longer works properly either.3D. It is absolutely baffling that the bugs in this game got through quality assurance (QA). At this point I’m thinking players are the official QA for PCF. In the current Reddit thread for the one shot bug, PCF is requesting players answer 20 questions. A similar thread existed for the item wipes. PCF has repeatedly shown that they can’t be bothered to detect and diagnose bugs themselves, and instead players are expected to write an essay for them. Rather than writing the essay PCF wants, I’ve decided to write my essay here as a steam review. It’s fine to ask for help from players, but at the level of help they are asking for, you are no longer a player, you are a play tester and you should be getting paid by PCF, not the other way around.4. The campaign works on a Diablo like Torment system, in Outriders this is the World Tier (WT). There are 12 WT levels that are unlocked as you play the game and your progress to the next level gets partially removed when you die. This is a good system that would be in the pros section in any other game, but PCF shoots themselves in the foot. WT becomes pointless the moment you unlock the expeditions endgame content, because there is a second difficulty scaling system for expeditions only, Challenge Tier (CT). WT gear from campaign max drops at level 42, CT gear max drops at level 50. Now you could spend resources to level up the lower level gear, but there is no incentive to even play WT campaign content because the drop rates of legendary gear is massively lower than in expeditions. This means that instead of spending time doing the 30 hour campaign again, you just do the same 15 expeditions over and over that take 5-20 minutes each at gold medal time. It just arbitrarily limits the content you can do if you want good gear, hurting fun and replay-ability. Said good gear being the entire point of a looter shooter.5. The endgame expedition missions have the same issue as Diablo 3, its timed content. Your worthwhile rewards for the missions are almost entirely dependent on finishing the mission as fast as possible. If you build anything but pure damage, you will not beat these timers. It shoehorns you into glass cannon builds, drastically decreasing the number of viable builds in endgame content. You want to build tank, your just wasting your time.Conclusion: This could have been so much longer, but if by now I haven’t changed your mind, nothing I add is going to change that. PCF, like many of developers as of late, clearly believes that it is alright too officially release a game that I’m not sure should even be considered a beta build. The demo was a more stable experience than the full game. This game has so much potential that has just been squandered. PCF didn’t deserve my money, and they don’t deserve yours either.;Not Recommended;134.6;5/05/2021;1,601;28
Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;Before one can understand where I stand when it comes to Worldslayer, one must know my thoughts pre-Wordslayer.Unfortunately, in the gaming world that we live in today, no matter the publisher or developer, a game rarely releases without major flaws or is without the need for major fixes.  So even when I buy a game that is "full-released", I still go into the game with the mindset that it's an "early access" game, "there's going to be issues, and they'll address them as soon as possible.".I was one of the many ignorant consumers that played the demo, pre-purchased, and had high hopes for the launch date.  Originally owned it on Stadia, along with 2 gaming buddies.  The first major problem for me was the inability to disable "motion-blur".  I absolutely cannot play with motion blur.  I get physically sick over-time.  No big deal!  I'll just refund it, get the game on steam, and use the cross-play function to play with my friends who stayed with Stadia.  It doesn't work?  One of the biggest functions that they were so proud to announce, leading up to launch, DOESN'T WORK??  No big deal, no big deal.  They'll fix it.  It had to have worked at some point, right?  Other-wise they would have said that cross-play won't be available on launch, right?  They would have warned us, been transparent.  A week goes by.  Friends and I still can't play together.  A month goes by.  "What fricken liars..." Stadia was still stuck on a version older than the demo on steam.. Cross-play with stadia probably never worked...I ended up playing solo.  Beat the game alone. Why?Pros:  AMAZING FRICKEN COMBAT!(for the most part)Scratched the looter shooter itch i had, ever since Borderlands 2 was beaten over and over again. And Borderlands 3 failed to appease.  The world tier levels actually added a level of difficulty that was satisfying to overcome and enter the next.Theory crafting builds... addicting. Cons:Randomly having gear deleted from inventory throughout the playthrough.Audio glitches up and down, left and right... The game just straight up feels janky most of the time(when you aren't immersed in the fluid combat that you can experience every now and then)The final boss was literally just a bullet sponge.  No actual skill to defeat it necessary.My friends and I had thought that by the time we all had gotten to the end game, cross-play would have been fixed... by the time cross-play was working... we had uninstalled and moved on to much bigger and better things.Finally we come to Worldslayer within this review...  DO NOT GIVE PEOPLE CAN FLY ANYMORE MONEY!Same jank, and STILL THE SAME FRICKEN AUDIO ISSUES!They do not deserve it.  The outrageously over-priced DLC that Worldslayer is, is something that People Can Fly should have actually just gifted us for all of the lies and jank that they sold us from before.Worldslayer's campaign was actually a lot of fun! All 2 minutes of it... The new "endgame" is such a HUGE missed opportunity.  My friends and I actually grinded it out til Apocalypse tier 24... and finally asked ourselves a question that I've read in a few other reviews, "What are we even playing for?"  "Why do we care about new builds and grinding gear, when this lackluster end-game "barely" changes?!"  Sure new enemies begin to appear with new apocalypse tiers, sure they have more hp, deal more damage... but it doesn't feel any different.  Same exact bosses, same stupid mechanics.. mechanics that my friends and I can just ignore, because the difficulty doesn't exist!  We had never failed a run!  We literally built troll builds, knowing that we didn't have any damage... and still breezed on through!  (except for those ravenous monkey things on cliffside... those things are actually no joke... at least at first)If you made it this far, thanks for reading a rant from someone that feels betrayed and greatly let down by these devs.  Do not give your money to these greedy, deceitful people.  Wish I could say this was another "Cyberpunk or No Man sky" where the game will actually be worth your money one day... but they have proven to me with this over-priced DLC, that they have no intention of actually giving the people, that want to love their game, anything that they want.;Not Recommended;86.8;24/07/2022;670;10
Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;Sum-UpOUTRIDERS is a third person sci-fi looter-shooter set on an alien world. Because of mankind's recklessness, Earth was on the brink of destruction due to environmental and social collapse. A gigantic colonization ship was built and traveled for centuries, until it reached an earth-analog planet called Enoch, with millions of people kept under stasis. You'll play as an Outriders team member, elite explorers meant to spearhead the colonization of what is now the new frontier.🟩 Pros🟥 Cons- Great class diversity: each has a different gameplay and several progression possibilities.- Fluid, dynamic combat system that rewards both well thought-out builds and player skill.- Huge amount of interesting additional lore files that expand on the setting.- Enjoyable gear modding system, that greatly broadens build variety and flexibility.- Large amounts of unique gear to collect, including sets and legendary items.- Excessively grindy and poorly scaled endgame segment, more so for Solo players.- Subpar performance optimization, even on hardware that exceeds requirements.- Overall poor amount of enemy archetypes, high rates of "recycling" throughout.- Cringe-worthy, dull main character that always feels generic and uninteresting.- Largely linear level design, with few secondary areas and no real open-world.🟨 Bugs & Issues🔧 Specs- Quest tracking often indicates the wrong path to follow.- Uncommon crashes and disconnections.- Always-online required, even for playing solo.- Some enemies' melee hit registration / collision are severely broken.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:It took me, along with a friend, 42 hours to complete Outriders, doing all side content and endgame raids. Replay value is good, as each class plays out differently and starting over can be interesting to try a different one. The same can't be said about the endgame part, which would prove dull after a second run.Is it worth buying?Yes, but not for 60€. The quality is decent and content amount fair, however I still suggest getting this with a substantial discount (40% or better), as it has yet many drawbacks and faults that make it annoying at times. In addition, I do not recommend it to Solo players, as they will have a very frustrating time during endgame phases.Verdict: DecentRating Chart HereAn overall enjoyable looter-shooter that even tries to give its own spin to the formula, with various degrees of success (or failure). It innovates well in some aspects but feels lackluster in others. in the end it proves decent, but nothing more than that.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high quality reviews regularly.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2654823988In-DepthI can change almost anything, but I can't change human natureThis quote from Dr. Manhattan perfectly describes the state of Enoch once humanity arrives and things get interesting. What started out as a Garden of Eden is soon turned into a wasteland scorched by endless warfare, misery, cruelty and pollution - just like good old Earth, minus alien space-time anomalies. In this bleak setting, the protagonist is touched by the mysterious Anomaly Storm and instead of dying becomes an Altered, like many others before him. Beings capable of harnessing godlike powers and gifted with superhuman endurance, strength and durability. From here, a quest starts to find a remote signal that shouldn't even exist, and could give everyone the answers needed to stop the madness.Conquering the frontier, one section at a timeThe world of Outriders is divided in zones, viewable on a global map that is progressively revealed as the protagonist's expedition reaches new places. Each is, once again, divided into smaller areas, some of which compose the main path relative to the story quests, while many others are locked out unless made available by triggering a secondary quest. Level structure is linear, with minimal side exploration or secrets to find. Secondary quests usually have their own little stories and some are even interesting, however the main character's dullness takes a lot of the involvement away, no matter the dialogue choice. Most missions play out in the same way, which is roughly "go there, kill everyone, interact with something, go back" - expected by this genre.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2659005308Building yourself to succeedOne of the highlights of Outriders is the progression system, which integrates character progression, skills and weapon modding in a seamless system where each part is equally important. As a class levels up it will unlock new skills, up to three can be set as active and used at any given time, these abilities can be further enhanced by Mods present in armor or weapons that can modify, even drastically, how each ability works. The amount is huge and ranges from offensive to defensive, support ones among three tiers. Passive perks found in each Class Tree, divided into three specializations, provide further bonuses especially if paired with the right gear mods for your planned role. Crafting allows not only upgrading each weapon's passive attributes, rarity and level, but also swapping mods and scrapping weapons for resources and mods: a previously unknown mod will become permanently available once scrapped from a weapon.In the grim darkness of the future, there is only warCombat in Outriders, despite being a cover-based TPS, heavily encourages mobility and well-timed usage of skills / weapon  passives to not get overwhelmed. Each class has its own way of regaining health, be it simply dealing damage or more technical actions, and this is the only way to reliably regain HP - camping in a corner won't work, especially later on. A large part of the action revolves around Altered abilities and weapon skills, which can transform the combat area in a pile of stacked status effects, bonuses, AoE and more - it becomes chaotic when enemy numbers are high, but surprisingly fun. Combat does have some issues, like enemy aggro rules being arbitrary and several melee enemies having completely broken hit registration, the dodge-roll's iframe even if well-timed, will not always save you. While viable solo at least until endgame, combat shines when multiple classes synergize their abilities into even more potent combinations.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2651100095Expedition is a go. Destination - grind centralAfter clearing the story, Endgame ensues, with Expeditions composing the entirety of content. Think of them as "raids", divided among 15 Tiers, unlocked as the previous one is beaten. Despite there being a decent pool of twenty-or-so missions, they just offer some new bosses sparingly, but mostly spam already seen enemies over and over again, without any random factor. Given that to grind the best gear and the needed resources to unlock the final boss it will take many hours, the repetition and dullness soon become evident. Furthermore, the scaling in Tiers 13-15 is badly balanced, transforming most enemies into huge bullet sponges that require patience and boring kiting around to overcome. The final boss itself is the extremization of all the previous issues, an absolutely annoying and broken fight that will leave you with a bitter aftertaste.;Recommended;44.4;20/11/2021;501;11
Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;This has been, honestly, by far the worst release I've ever been apart of. This game lacks everything needed to be complete. Game breaking bugs, lack of Dev support, Dev's not listing to the community in fact they out right blame the community for the games problems. Almost zero updates since release, crashing servers, total char item wipes, empty promises and outright lies.... I find it bizarre as well that this game claims to be trying to create the most immersive co-op experience ever and doesn't implement any sort of communication. That's right ZERO way to talk to the other players.. No Text... No Voice... hell you can't even ping targets. This is truly a single player co-op game. You have 3 playing but all doing their own thing, as well the add friend feature is also not working so forget adding them and trying a third party service.Overall I truly needed write a review seeing as how I spent $80 on something that's just so poorly done. If I can stop one person from getting this pile of junk then its been a review worth writing.** Update ** I totally understand the confusion based around the amount of time I've played and the recommendation to not get the game.I spent a lot of money on the title and, in my own way enjoy the game. I see potential in its current state but I would be hard pressed to think someone else would be as open minded. I mean some of the hate here shows as much.I will continue to play this game as much as long as I wish but I cannot see others enjoying this rocky experience and feel obligated to give my opinion.I still would not recommend this game I hope people spend their money elsewhere. Honestly, best of luck.;Not Recommended;238.4;6/06/2021;1,427;44
Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;I like Outriders and the time invested so far can attest to that. But unfortunately I cannot recommend such a bug ridden game to anyone in good conscience. I will not go through the many bugs encountered, as other reviews have done so more eloquently than I could ever do. For me though, two game breaking bugs forced me to stop playing:- The _constant_ disconnections from the server. When I am playing solo, why is there a need for an always ON connection? There is nothing more disheartening than having gone through an expedition and at the last moment you get disconnected without any loot drops or resources to show for it. And it happens A LOT!- Co-op gaming is so buggy, I spent more time trying to connect to friends' games and via versa, rather than actually playing. Often when a connection is established, and a party has formed, a crash to the desktop follows. And today my inventory was wiped clean after such a crash for a good measure.Most of my friends are so fed up and annoyed with Outriders, that stopped playing some time ago, some even mid-campaign. Having lost all my items is a sign that I must move on too and a warning to all that still play this buggy mess, that this could happen to you at any time, so beware.;Not Recommended;123.5;15/04/2021;776;9
Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;Personally I'm rather fond of Outriders - I wanted a loot and shoot game, kinda like Destiny or Remnant. That's what I got. You pick a class, you get cool powers, you shoot some dudes, you get some cool stuff and neat looking guns. There's some end game grinds for item sets and such. I have played the campaign fully co-op and single player with 2 separate classes. I enjoyed myself enormously. I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people expecting a live service game or MMO - which the game is not, however it feels like that in places with it's destiny Esq UI and inventory. As long as you adjust your expectations accordingly, go in for a good 25-30 hour single player game with some extra's for end game replay ability you will enjoy yourself.The graphics are fantastic, the music is good but not memorable. The voice acting ranges from absolutely fantastic to downright awful and hilarious. The gun play is rather fun and powers SUPER satisfying. This is a solid 7.5/10 game that I can recommend when it's on sale.;Recommended;147.0;18/10/2021;419;12
Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;So, I'm trying to revise this review as I've (tried to) play some more of this game a the last few days, a few months post launch.What I originally wrote about the FP and AP scaling in the balance section is not true (anymore?).AP still scales post max character level even if you don't get any AP on your items. In fact certain AP builds outperform the typical FP builds but require legendaries (and their tier 3 mods) to work.But that aside the multiplayer aspect of this game is horrible.Usually the game just crashes either when:- trying to join a lobby of friends- trying to leave any lobby- opening the loot box at the end of an expedition (endgame repeatable mission)- after using a skill such as jumping towards your enemy/friend (like Trickster's Hunt the Prey)- trying to start an expedition- trying to quit the game (not the worst, but forces you to use the task manager to kill it after closing it unless you're content with Outrider's weird memory leaks to eat up your expensive RAM while playing something that works)If you try to join a lobby for expeditions (it gives you the choice between expeditions and campaign), it pairs you with someone trying to finish the campaign. If you leave your lobby open people will (have to) join who have no interest in doing the same thing you want to do in the game. It's incredibly useless.FYI: if you run a lobby with friends and one of them leaves it automatically sets the party to open, allowing the aforementioned things to happen even if you didn't provoke it.---------------------Down here you can read my original review:Background: ex Warframe player looking for an alternative-----The good: Personally I like the storyline. I like sci-fi settings in general so if you aren't a sci-fi fan you might find it somewhat bland. But you still get a sense of mystery since most questions that come up during the storyline will remain unanswered and you will notice that your main character the recurring characters will simply have to learn to deal with that and often drift into a strongly depressive mood over how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ humanity really is. The dubs underline this, there really aren't any high emotions in the way people talk.The combat is overall enjoyable. A reason why I bought the game after seeing a few streams and videos.-----The "expected": This game doesn't have a lot of content and it gets grindy very fast where you repeat the same mission (certain expeditions) over and over again. That by itself isn't a huge problem to me, many games I otherwise like work this way. But it may push away many people. And it still leaves a sour aftertaste for a game costing 60 EUR.-----The bad: The balance in this game is really bad.Balance between enemies:some are about as difficult as level 1 critters in WoW, others make bosses in Dark Souls III envious.In general the non-humanoid enemies (beasts etc.) are much easier. The humanoids have incredible aimbots, strong skills and weapons. You open a door to another room and lose half your health within the 0.1 second you didn't immediately step to the side.Balance between builds:The only endgame content are expeditions where rewards are time gated like Mythic+ raids in WoW.But there is no such thing as aggro management nor any significant amount of team heal/support which eliminates every build but the highest DPS build for each class from the get go.Furthermore between Firepower and Ability Power FP simply scales better since it only relies on your gear (which can go up to item level 50) whereas for AP there is a components that makes it scale with your character level (which can only go up to level 30). In consequence at enemy and item level 50 (the highest tier of expeditions) AP builds generally perform worse than FP builds. There is only one type of skill - the anomaly rounds - that really works in an FP build. Only 3 of the 4 classes have access to that, the Devastator is missing out - luckily the Devastator skills are otherwise quite good so an Earthquake Bleed build is usually strong enough. Despite heavy nerfs around the anomaly rounds builds they still are the only ones that are viable for the endgame content for those 3 classes that have it. And until the devs tackle AP scaling this will remain the way it is.Also you will see no such thing as a team composition. In Warframe often times 3 supports and 1 DPS frame makes for a better setup than 4 DPS frames. In Outriders it's 4 DPS classes with top DPS builds for each or bust. And certainly some classes are still better than others. (Technomancer > Trickster/Pyromancer > Devastator)Besides, there is no real reason to play in a party. Enemy HP scale with number of players in your party. But most classes rely on kills to survive. (All but Technomancer.) Which means if you play with 4 players the game is inherently harder than solo. The numbers of enemies also scale but that makes sense - many games do that. Just enemy HP shouldn't scale imo.-----The ugly: Yes, you heard right, the dev's answer to a balance problem is to nerf the ♥♥♥♥ out of whatever works for most people. The devs also lowered the time restrictions for certain expeditions, because they "felt" it was "too generous". And removed guaranteed legendary drops if you repeat certain story quests. This and the fact that the only endgame content is timegated just shows how backwards their game design choices are. Not fit for a game released in 2021.-----The absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible which makes up for more than 50% of why I chose a don't recommend rating:There are game-breaking bugs. If you join a multiplayer lobby you risk your inventory getting wiped. With the recent patch the same may apply to singleplayer. Yes, you heard right, you can log on right now and your entire character may end up naked. Fun. In the Dwarf Fortress sense of fun. Now add problems where many people can't log in at all (well at least that means their characters aren't getting wiped) or have frequent disconnects.-----In addition to all that I don't understand why they didn't make an offline game. In principle the game works just like Grim Dawn, Torchlight, Diablo II or Borderlands (to list a shooter). So why can't we have characters saved locally (or in the Steam cloud etc.), host our own games, possibly with modding? What's the point of going out of your way to prevent people from cheating in a co-op game? The servers must cost Square Enix a ton. For no purpose whatsoever.In the end I strongly regret spending that much money on this game.;Not Recommended;109.8;10/04/2021;1,049;26
Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;This game has amazing potential. I've played it for over 350 hrs so i think I've earned my right to say my peace. The combat is good when you are not getting one shotThe story is meh if we are really being honest with ourselvesThe endgame is a joke its the same 6 (15 Total) maps that people will grind to get a god roll weapon or piece of armorIt is only a speed run simulator and that for me grows boring quicklyThe world they built is beautiful but its isn't used after the main campaign a real waste in my opinionThe many multiplayer bugs really killed a lot of interest for my friends and I ended up just alone in a game that is forced to be online 24/7This game could be amazing if they 1. Fix the many bugs2. Admit this is a live service game and treat it as such3. Add new content (modes, expedition types, Story DLC)4.

Square Enix;Outriders;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 90,90;So, what can I say about Outriders that's good? Because there is some good interspersed between all of the glitches and poor game design and I want to give credit where credit's due.THE GOOD-------------* The lore of this game is just awesome. I really loved the setup and the depth that they go into in all of the various journals and articles. I realize I'm probably in the minority here because I actually read them, but they were enjoyable to read. It was really interesting getting the perspective of the chaos on Earth, the first year of being on the new planet, and all of the different character's thoughts and feelings throughout the game.* I played Pyro and I honestly found the abilities and how your weapons and armor all tied into and enhanced them to be really nice. Is it unique? Nah, but they did a reasonable job with it and there were times where I had some really awesome combo's that made me feel like a true pyromancer. * Some unique and interesting weapons in the game, especially later on, and you weren't punished on ammo like in Destiny 2 where I hear they're still trying to find heavy ammo for their guns to this day...* There's some great side quests that were well written and had some unexpected twists. I enjoyed... most of them!* The game is extremely pretty. It's just a shame that it's all looks and no substance. Okay that's... pretty much it. If you read all of that, you might notice some pretty important things missing. Don't worry... I got you covered in...THE BAD----------* Not gonna lie, this game pissed me off on multiple occasions. Why? Because the combat system is so poorly balanced and even unfair at times. By the time you're level 22 - 26 or so, you've unlocked most of your skill points and things have slowed down as far as new gear coming in so you can start to develop your build a bit and be a bit more stable and consistent in how your skills and weapons work. However! While you're leveling up, you're replacing gear so often that you can't really develop a build at all and you just feel gimped all the frigging time! Combine that with my next point...* The AI are ♥♥♥♥♥! The game offers itself as a cover-based shooter, yet the AI rarely respects that and constantly forces you to run around in the open while chunky boss enemies run right up onto you into short-range combat while their army of snipers pick you off from across the map. Or enemies constantly toss grenades at you or just blindly charge into melee range and start whacking you. As you crank up the world level the enemies get spongier and this becomes more and more frustrating as you can no longer quickly pick enemies off, especially since you're gimped for 1/2 to 3/4 of the game. I dropped the world level to 3 after multiple attempts on 7 and some extremely frustrating boss fights and just mowed my way through the rest of the game. It was always either too brain dead easy or too frustratingly difficult with very little in between.* The cutscenes and the lip sync and the subtitles... I was surprised to see "Square Enix" with their name attached to this game when I started it up every play session because while I know they didn't develop it themselves... oh my god the quality was not up to snuff. It's incredible... just absolutely... incredible how badly they screwed up the cutscenes. There were times when the characters spoke before their voice lines played and vice versa. There were also times where the subtitles didn't match up with the characters speaking on screen... and towards the end I had one cutscene where the subtitles played rapid fire and were done wayyyy before the characters were done talking. It was actually insane. The camera is jank as all hell and there's tons of awkward cuts all the time throughout the game. One second they're driving through a horrendous situation and the next they're chilling at camp with no transition. It was SO jarring. Just... not well done at all and made it so hard to get into the world.* They even messed up the quest marker! The janky thing will point to quests you've already completed in an area, even when you've swapped to another quest. They don't let you go back into the area once you've completed the quest unless you go back and redo it... so why is the quest marker telling me that the quest I just selected is going to the area I just completed?! How did this not get fixed in the 4 months since the game came out?!* There was a distinct lack of interactions with a lot of the characters. Many characters just... popped up for a brief time and then never had any sort of role ever again. They never had new voice lines as things happened in the world and in general they were all just throwaway characters to move the plot forward. No depth whatsoever to most of them.* Endgame combat is pretty much a joke... at least, it seems the balance was never really fixed. If you're a pyro, just go with a light machine gun with 150 rounds and Perpetuum Mobile. Congrats! You now have an infinite ammo machine gun that shoots fire rounds and will keep reloading itself as long as you keep killing enemies. Once I got this it made all of my other weapons obsolete and just pointless to use. It's that broken. Infinite ammo, infinite healing, cover no longer mattered and I was just a god running around in the game completely unstoppable. Fun for a few missions, but then it lost its luster.* There's a TON of repetition. The same enemies, the same mission types, over and over and over again. Hell, some of the Bounties you did had the same exact character model for the dude you were hunting. It gets really stale really quick and the final 1/4 of the game is just one area of repetition after another. Tldr. it's frigging boring. * Annnnd finally... the game had an entirely unfulfilling ending. Some spoilers here btw! You've been warned. There's no conclusion whatsoever... the bad guy that you fight... 3 TIMES... is still not dead in the ending credits. For some reason, your character just refuses to kill them and so now they're alive through sheer plot armor for another game. Absolutely nothing is concluded and the game just sets itself up for a really monotonous endgame all to get you to... wait for it... unlock another boss battle in the eye of the storm to..... FIGHT THE SAME GUY FOR A 4TH TIME! Wooo.... and I think he's actually dead this time... maybe. But who really knows? There's just a few comments by the characters from back at camp after this occurs and then that's it. The storm is absolutely the same and there's no extra cutscene or wrap up in any way. You leave and it's just right back to the pod grind.CONCLUSION---------------There's times where I had fun playing this game for sure! But they were quickly drowned out by all of the problems and poor design decisions that went into Outriders. When the final credits played all I could think about was the long list of issues I had experienced throughout the game more than the "epic conclusion" to the story. That makes me sad, because like I said earlier, there WAS good writing in places and it had some good moments along the way. I wish they had put more effort into smoothing out all of the issues in Outriders. It really needed another year of development. I'm betting that if it released in April of 2022 instead of April of 2021, we'd have had a much better game than what we got. Even if they do continue the franchise... I'm not sure I care enough at this point to continue playing. The endgame has no meaning and for me... this is going into uninstall land likely never to see my hard drive again.I wholeheartedly recommend that you don't buy this game, at least at full price.

Nexon;MapleStory 2;None;None;tldr. Grind festival, just like many others. The sweet spot would be probably around 10 hours a week split across running dungeons and gathering/crafting for casuals. More for hardcore because of alts.Here's how gameplay goes:1. Start game.2. Slog through main quest by pressing spacebar and killing stuff.3. Reach level 60 and get gear that makes it so you don't do peanuts (that means terrible damage).4. World boss all the way to 70.5. Run dungeons.6. Cry about how RNG is only giving you gear that's not for your class or earrings/pendants/rings so your Gear Score isn't going up.7. Finally overcome RNG and get belt/cape.8. Get to chaos raids.9. Get told you suck because you have crap attributes on your equips and no sockets for gemstones.10. Realize that you didn't get enough earrings/pendants/rings and have to farm the stuff you thought you passed.11. Hit the weekly limit and lament that you can't pass gear between characters unless it's level 50 and your alts can beat Fortress Rumbles for the Trader Ribbons.12. Get gear from chaos raids by leeching off carries and then get shut down by the abhorrent onyx crystal costs.13. Repeat for the next chaos raid. And the next.14. Repeat for the Eye of Lapenta dungeons, except more strictly because you can only have 4 people there.Alternatively, live in Queenstown and only worry about how cute your character is.;Recommended;1,193.6;3/07/2019;224;144

It is rather linear with its story however there is plenty of content ranging from dungeons, questing, PVP,  life-skilling and mini-games. There is more depth as well as complexity and has a beautiful, expansive world, unique enemy design, easy combat and a very great social aspect within which makes MS2 certainly a step up from its predecessor. With all aspects in mind, this is not a serious MMO like WOW or BDO with emphasis on grinding away for gear or PVP'ing but instead is a casual MMO with emphasis on its social aspects.

Nexon;MapleStory 2;None;None;The dopest MMORPG I've ever played. My friend, this is like if the original MapleStory met Phantasy Star Universe and they had a baby, and then meanwhile, Minecraft and Final Fantasy Worlds met and had a baby, and by some miracle, those two babies met and had a baby of their own, this would be what they birthed.It's cute, great fun, and very addicting. More importantly, it's an MMORPG that's easy to play and accommodate to, even if you aren't familiar with MMOs or RPGs. If you want a game that keeps you in a not-so-serious and upbeat mood while requiring some serious combat, the opportunity to raid and socialize/teambuild, and some invested thought in character/skill building with the potential for multiple characters, this is definitely for you.The best part about MapleStory 2 is that there are SO many things to do! Naturally, for all of the best parts, there are some cons--but it seems unavoidable with MMORPGs.There's a Main Quest that's soloable, as well as World Quests that you can find at random from NPCs around the World Map. Some parts of this require grinding to be able to beat the Dungeon Bosses/Finish the Quest Bosses (I haven't experienced much of a slowdown thus far and I'm LV 25)...This could also present troublesome news for more intense MMORPG-drawn gamers who prefer to stretch out their Levelling: I'm at 23 hours of gameplay and I'm around LV 25, so while that's a great pace for me, I'm sure that spells irritability for others.You have the ability to build your own house--I spent a solid 3 hours building, and I ONLY put down the FLOOR. I haven't even gotten to my walls or interior yet!--and there's so many options to go with--so many interior design possibilities--it's sometimes overwhelming (Thank goodness for mini-game breaks). This definitely hooks those of us who could spend 3 hours making their Sims and their respective houses, and offers a lot of potential for customization. They even offer trophies, quests, rewards and EXP for doing it. My only gripe with the housing system that there isn't any kind of mass area select, so you're left to drop every. single. block. down. one. at. a. time. It can grow weary on the eyes when laying a foundation, and you lose sight of the bigger picture if you have a goal in mind. Also, if you're playing on a controller, prepare to be forced into mouse+keyboard play, because there are some aspects and keybindings of house building that are too expansive for a controller. It takes a LOT of patience to build your own place, but if you're Minecraftian or used to piece-by-piece building for the end result, this won't be an empasse for you.Mini-Games! They offer lovely breaks in-between whatever it is you're doing--whether it be the Quests, grinding, or house building--and they're always welcomed! You aren't required to participate, of course, but I definitely recommend trying them. Among a few others, there's the musical-chairs-esq Dance Dance Stop, and a Quiz Game that will leave you feeling moronic for succumbing to mob mentality, but always joyous in spirit. You can earn EXP from these games, as well as Trophies.The classes you can pick from are typical among MMOs (Wizard, Priest, Assassin, Thief, Warrior, etc.), and the skills are just the same. Seasoned MMO gamers will find nothing new here, and the Skill Tree you build will definitely seem droll compared. Those of us who aren't so limber will enjoy the different combination of skills you can make, as well as the ability to "take back" the skills immediately for no cost--this allows you to rebuild your tree, and use completely different skills if you so desire, which helps a lot during certain Bosses.Character customization, surprisingly, offers quite a varied, free selection to start off with, and even equipment is customizable for Mesos (free in-game currency). If you're willing to pay, your character will look exactly the way you'd love--but boy, do you have to pay. Each piece of the latest Halloween ensemble will run your bill up over $100. But hey, you'll look cute.In regards to paid, in-game currency (not free Mesos)--there are two kinds: Blue Merets which you've paid for using real-world cash, and Red Merets you've earned in-game, somehow (I earned some and don't remember how). I got a Founder's Pack with 2,000 Merets, only bought some furniture, and still have 400 left with no idea what to spend it on strategically. That said, I sincerely hope it stays that way.All of the above options are strictly cosmetic, so don't expect to buy your way into the best equipment--just the most kawaii fashion shows. It's definitely not P2W.They make it quite easy to come across other players and connect. You can create custom chat tabs where you can see exactly what you want--users, guilds, party, etc. You can head to the most populated areas and look for people to chat up, and you can even speak during the Mini-Games. There have even been points where you see someone struggling through a Boss and you can step in at any point to help them beat it, whether it benefits you or not (at minimum, you get EXP for the encounter). There's also no fighting over loot, as everyone only sees their own gains.Nexon has already improved in-game Channel spam, and I definitely see the difference they've implemented. AVADA KEDAVRA MESO SCALPERS!MapleStory 2's gameplay is very fluid and smooth--the only issues I've experienced thus far that linger in my memory long enough to truly bother me have been with House building--when you lay down too many blocks, the system seemingly begins to lag when placing them down (but I don't know if this is my internet connection or the server? I have over 200Mbps and don't have problems on other MMOs, but who knows). The MapleStory 2 storyline for the Main Quest, and most of the World Quests can read as very juvenile, but it's totally supposed to be (The analogy in the first paragraph rings true here). There's no obligation to actually invest in the story or the characters, you always have the option to skip the cutscenes and go for the gold--although I love me some Joddy.Imagine, I've only explored a portion of this game in my 25 levels and 23 hours of gameplay (Updating this review at level 30+ with 70+ hours) and I have this much to say about it. I'm so, so excited to do more. There's fishing, mining, trophies and quests that unlock items and customization options, racing, pets...just...so much to do!

Nexon;V4;Simulation;R$ 162,00;Initial Perception.OK. So being an old fan of Transport Tycoon, I had seen A-train a number of times, and had not bought it, as I was never really convinced that it was going to be a good game. It always seemed to be a mess of complex options, and half built cities with the player left to simply re-arrange the rail options of the already working city. It also seemed like it was too diverse, with a mix of both city management, and not really enough depth for transport management.I could not have been more wrong.**A-Train 9 V4.0 : Japan Rail Simulator**So I saw this new version,  intiially discounted it as I thought it was really expensive. Again my initial impression was "Meh ..... not sold on this at all." So I waited and I bought this on a sale for something like $20  (Wow was I lucky - a complete steal ) Having played it, I believe it is actually worth the high price tag. This is simply THE most impressive transport and logistics management game or rather simulation that I have ever played.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, with a design unique to this game. They are almost cartoon like, but not quite. the detail is amazing,  and even when zoomed at high resolution the game really looks very sweet.The first thing I decided was that I was going to actually put some time in, and learn the game. - For anyone considering buying this game, this is critical. It does have a learning curve, you will need to experiment. There is no instant gratification. That said there are tons of youtube videos. One set I found particularfly good was from "Monte" , Monterico Gaming -  https://www.youtube.com/user/montericotips   who has a very nice set of tutorial videos on Atrain 9, check him out, and give him a like. The guy has put in a great deal of work, and his videos are well worth watching, and explain in great detail how to get started - Thanks Monte, Much appreicated.Dont expect a half hearted point and click sim city clone, as the depth and wealth of options in this game is absolutely incredible. The first thing I did , was to understand how to create a new map, on the map generator, with nothing at all on it. This is incredibly easy, and the player has complete control over how they would like their game world to look. Options range from the amount of water, to the height and distribution frequency of the mountains. The player can have an archipeligo with a number of islands connected by bridges, or a large landmass, with a single coastline, or anything in between. The options are limitless.Once you decide on how you want your world to look you then build your transport network. You have options to add buildings, and subsidiaries, but your main task is to ensure the flow of materials. This is where the logistics of the game come in. You create a factory. The factory will produce raw materials. However the raw materials sit in the "shipping" bay of the factory, and are not useable by any 3rd party who wishes to use themYou own the factories, so you do not make a profit unless the materials are used. Therefore you need to ensure that the materials are moved from the factory, through a distribution centre , to a freight storage area. This can be done either by rail, or by truck , depending on which method of transport is more suitable.So once you move the materials, they can be purchased to build houses, shops offices etc, in your city. You gain profit by selling the materials, however you need to absorb the logistics cost of moving materials to various distribution centres to ensure the growth of your city. You then have the opportunity to provide a transportation network to your digital citizens who inhabit your city. This is in the form of a Bus network, a rail network and a subway system.This is where you can make the profit in running a transportation network. I think the big difference here is that in many transportation games, you already have customers, and simply need to provide transport, Here you can provide freight transport of materials to build a city, which will in turn provide the opportunity for a transportation system. The depth is incredible. I have to say I am totally hooked on this game. There is so much to do. If you find yourself running low on funds, you can buy and sell shares on the stock market. This is pretrty easy, and can make the game a little easy, but if you only use it as needed, and work to ensure your transport network becomes profitable, then its just a useful backup.This game will drag you in. If you are a fan of train fever, and Transport tycoon then this game is definitely worth the money without question. I would pay $50 for this game, and be very satisfied. Just bear in mind, it does need some time to get used to it. Setting options for stations, where trains arrive and depart on different platforms, and move to different tracks is very powerful, and allows you to manage multiple trains on a route and switch tracks at intersection points ( which you can lay when laying tracks) but takes a little time to get your head around. Once you get it, the possibilites click, and you can make something as simple as a country station with 2 tracks, to a thriving metropolis hub with multiple tracks and platforms with trains arriving and departing 24/7I love this game, before this, train fever was the closest I had seen to transport tycoon, but this is like a simulated virtual train set, where you configure the game world and run it as you see fit. I cant recommend this highly enough. Whether you wish to spend the full price on it or not , is up to you. I can understand why you would question it, as I did.  I think the marketing on this game actually underplays what it is capable of. Its very modest in comparison to some games. I was really pleasantly surprised. This will definitely be one of the games that has a permanent place on my hard disk, and one of the games that I will return to time and again. I usually dont spend a lot of time reviewing a game, unless I feel really strongly about it. This one is worth it. Pros : Incredible depth, Beautiful cartoon like graphics, huge game world, Complete transport and logistics simulation, trains, trucks, and busses, city management elements, complete control over materials logistics and transport.Cons: Price seems a little high, steep learning curve, needs time to show real potential.Recommend : Definitely YES;Recommended;42.2;9/02/2016;151;4
Nexon;V4;Simulation;R$ 162,00;The price of this version is almost the same as the ones on the original Japanese shop, while there are far less variety of train in this version.If you come here after watching these Japanese game streams about this game, then do not expect this one would contain all contents in these videos.

So I will provide the link below if you wanted.Of course, if you have troubles reading Japanese, then this one is for you.

Nexon;V4;Simulation;R$ 162,00;I wish I could recommend it - I really do - because I spent hours upon hours building intricate cities and transport networks. However, due to a recent Windows 10 update, this game no longer works on that OS. there is a workaround, but it involves running the game with minimum graphics quality, and this game's visuals were already not its strong suit. Seeing as the community manager no longer works for the developer, and the developers are not responding nor fixing the game, I unfortunately can't recommend it, especially given its high price tag. I've had a good run, but I feel cheated that I can no longer use a game I paid for to its full potential.EDIT: A workaround has been found and I can play the game with high graphics quality again, but the fact that it was only found months later by a fellow player, with no support nor acknowledgement from the developer, leads me to maintain my negative review. Buyer beware - this is an unsupported product and could very well stop working again at any given time.EDIT 2: The workaround is no longer working, so the game is now basically impossible to play with high graphics quality on Windows 10.

I paid just $19.99 at a Steam Sale.  Good luck!;Recommended;146.4;31/10/2015;38;3
Nexon;V4;Simulation;R$ 162,00;This is a pretty enjoyable economic simulator / city builder, with several flaws. Actually the gameplay is good and addictive, albeit a bit shallow, and my negative evalutation is mainly due to the price. Considering that is just an updated version of the original A-Train 9 with some improvements, the current price (€.54,99) is too high. I suggest to buy it only if discounted to €.20/25.PROs: - building and developing cities is very addictive with a lot of buildings to choose in every category. - building complex rail networks is fairly easy and fulfilling. - very powerful editor. - scheduling trains is easy and enjoyable.CONs: - the track tool lacks automated terraforming, so negotiating with steepy grades is achieved with unaesthetic viaducts, and can also be very frustrating because of terrain obstacles.  - there is a lack of some instruments in map editor, like automate trees spreading. - the buildings built by Ai don't align with roads. - there are no objectives, missions or campaigs of any sort. The game is only a gigantic sandbox. - the world feels empty because there are neither AI cars or people. - there are only japanese trains in game and only few trains are really profitable and useful. - a catenary tool is available but is a bit flawed (however catenaries are only cosmetics). - the difficulty seems hard for beginners, but since you grasp the basics, it's rather easy, and you'll swim in money. - the stock exchange dynamics, when you grasp it, are very unrealistic and more like a money cheat.;Not Recommended;130.8;16/12/2015;63;5
Nexon;V4;Simulation;R$ 162,00;I really liked this game and had fun building my city. Adding multiple trains on a track and even heading different directions was very fun. The only thing that stopped me playing was the lack of life. No people...no traffic...no life... Only the trains and trucks you place. Fun game just made me feel really lonely. Why was I bothering making all these train line and bus routes for ghosts? With some life like cities skylines or even transport fever would have made this game a lot cooler.

Recommended for those who cannot read Japanese and can care less about the missing trains in this release to play this game. Just keep in mind that many JR trains, amongst more from private Japanese railway companies, are not available in the international release due to potentially inhibiting licensing fees and/or reasons undisclosed by the publisher of the International Release.On the other hand, for those who can actually read Japanese, know Japan enough to lust for the missing trains, and has enough knowledge to buy the download store version from the ARTDINK online store, BY ALL MEANS GO THERE INSTEAD.

Nexon;Mabinogi;Action, Adventure, Casual, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free to Play;None;although it says i have only 425 hours in this game that is far from the truth, i found this game on its website and then i went and found it on steam. Now although i love this game i will try to not be bias. so to begin, i will start the pros and then go to the consPROS:1.this game is massive, as of Thursday October 30, 2014. there is 16 generation story lines . then there is two episodic story lines , saga and iria, with iria on its 4th episode.2. you can do almost anything in this game. I always ask people " tell me what you'd like to do in the game." and I normally get stuff like "trading, clothing crafting, black-smithing " and those exist , probably one of the only things you cant do is open pvp. you have to invite the person to a pvp battle and they have to accept it.3. the graphic style, now this is both a pro and a con, i will talk about the pro part here, the good thing about the graphics is that they are rather simple. now not to say the game looks boring. the areas you can go are diverse and interesting. a winter mountain range full of giants, or a desert in a constant sandstorm with elves. or do you go to the lands of tera and tailliann, the front of the fight in g94. skill "tree". this game offer a interesting system for skills. it is free flowing. everything if offered to you at the start, there are a few that you have to unlock( like meteor, blizzard, and hydra transformation) or you have to be good in one skill set to unlock hidden skills. the beauty of the system is that you can always be doing stuff. i have one character that is level 2500 total and i have barely mastered any skill sets.5. Combat, now combat is interesting because it truly matters on what skill set you choose to adopt. a battle mage or spell sword are going to fight completely differently from an archer or puppeteer. but the most basic combat is like a real time rock paper scissors where some skills trump others but are trumped by others. this makes you require a bit of strategy but also quick moves6. events, there are always really fun and entertaining events, just last summer their was a big staged event that ended with an SAO eventCons.1. camera control, now this is the biggest complaint I've gotten from people, the camera is not the easiest to control. you ether have to right click, or move you mouse to the side of the screen. now yes in combat it can be a bit annoying. but it just takes a getting used to, it takes a bit of pre-planning2.graphics, like i said this is a pro and a con, now if you like the style and since its low in the graphics you can easily play it on low end pcs, but if you have a better one or don't like the art style, it will definitely be a turn off.3. the openness, now i know a lot of people like the openness but most likely as a newbie will get so caught up will all the possible skills he will want to try to use all of them and be weaker than they need to fight enemies of there level. it takes a bit of discipline to focus on just one class.4. pay-to-winness, now this may not be noticed by most people but since it is a free to play, there has to be some form of transactions. some of those include cool pets (like dragons) or gachapon that hold special items. these are used to get special items, these items can then be sold for gold to other players to make a profit. yes this does happen, yes there are people who have a whole quick slot full of dragons. but because of those people, everything can be acquired in game for gold. now it might annoy people that this is true but pay to win is not entirely true. it just depends what your term for "winning" i can honestly say I've probably spent 500+ on this game and that might sound crazy but for how many hours I've clocked i think its worth it;Recommended;1,411.6;30/10/2014;140;4

Nexon;Mabinogi;Action, Adventure, Casual, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free to Play;None;I used to love it.A game where newbies, veterans and pros could all hang out together. Unfortunately, none of this is true anymore. Mabinogi used to be a very casual and relaxing MMO that was all about hanging out with friends, chilling and have a good time. It had a unique combat system that was immensely rewarding for those who could figure it out. Any new player, with a bit of practice, would be a nice addition to any party and would feel like contributing.Gear was for fashion purpose only. It was common for newbies and veterans to wear the things.Combat performance was mostly based on game knowledge. Stats and attributes came second.After going through a few tutorials and learning the basics, a new player would have access to all the game content and had a whole world to explore. Then things went from bad to worse.Today's Mabinogi is now all about powergaming.It keeps adding new content intended to be more and more challenging, constantly giving you that incentive to buy the new generation of goodies to keep up with the game content.Gacha could no longer be ignored. It became mandatory to keep up with the game's absurd difficulty.Players used to take breaks during dungeons. We would light up a campfire and have a talk while we rest and heal. Now everyone is in a hurry and is dashing their way one room through the next mounted on their flashy horses and dragons. New players can't assist veterans. They'll have to grind for a good year or two before they can contribute to a serious party.Mabinogi is no longer appealing to the casual crowd.Not sure if it's still appealing to the hardcore crowd either...;Not Recommended;3,626.8;16/12/2020;90;5

G1 came out and the  friend i made i still remember.G2 came out and day 1 people were wondering how i was a wolf (they didnt realize pets were now a thing)even subscribed for the G2 storyline (yeah...u needed a sub to turn into paladin back then. glad that is gone. heck i dont even remember when it was removed...maybe my mind is playing tricks on me)and G3. waiting 2 weeks to build a team for Baol. and we spent a good 9 hours slogging through that.  this is when the game really was more focused to social rather than combat/speed.G9...changed that. shadow missions were easier to make income (good for repairs), and added so much cool stuff in the form of alchemy.    but...Ciar dungeon died that day....never again would there be groups just hanging out there talkingG9 in my mind is the start of the decline of the social focus of Mabinogi. in favor of a more action.this wasn't bad...G9-g12 story was still amazing.  but it was a change i later regret.post G12, my time in the game began to fade, G13 on...shakespear...it lacked the interest the prior gens had (ironic as we skipped g4-g8 for SO LONG.)and G13 would be when most of my friends, and guild, finally began to move on with life.myself as well.now, as all other MMOs have begun to lose appeal or feel hollow. i keep returning to Mabinogi.Tir Chronail specifically,  the music, the animations and graphics. everything is perfect.  and yet...my friends are gone. i look at my friendlist and miss them all.  realizing the flaw of a social game G1-g3.   when those your social with leave.  i still log in time to time, for short periods usually just to look at my character, look at friends. visit nostalgic places.it doesn't help Mabinogi seems determined to destroy the UI bar i set every time....but in the end, this is a game i cherish and yet can't touch.i'd be sad to see it go offline one day, and hope desperately an offline version is made just so i can continue wandering long after the last server goes off.i still have the posters of the game...and even the G1 strategy guide(in korean...i cant read but its nostalgic). heck my computer background is the G1 login screen of the statue of the goddess in every dungeon. music included!  i still rewatch Lorna and Pann!yet in the end....the game isn't the one i remember.   Not for the game's fault but just time itself.for anyone new to the game, enjoy it. i highly recommend G1-g12.  and know that you are walking on the land that once was the happiest place in gaming for so many people.;Recommended;166.8;23/04/2023;62;2
Nexon;Mabinogi;Action, Adventure, Casual, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free to Play;None;This game is like a really bad relationship, that you just keep going back to.You know it's bad.You want to leave.But you can't, even if you succeed to quit for a few days, weeks or years. YOU. ALWAYS. COME. BACK.THERE'S NO ESCAPE. PLZ HELP.THE DEVS ONLY RECENTLY STARTED TO SHOW A BIT OF CARE FOR THE GAME.BUT FOR TOO MANY YEARS HAS THIS THING BEEN A MASSIVE GACHA CASH GRAB.But despite how broken this game is sometimes.How crap the community can be.All the crappyy afk events we get.How little the devs care for the game.Coming back here feels like coming back home.The few good memories I have of this game I truly do cherish, and the handful of friends I made playing this, are some of the best I've made.So just, play at your own risk I guess?;Recommended;16,413.3;13/05/2022;53;20
Nexon;Mabinogi;Action, Adventure, Casual, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free to Play;None;I've been a mabi player for sometime now, what i can say the least is this: ALSO FOR STEAM PLAYERS: Nexon is cancelling out it's steam connections, to rely on it's own launcher strictly made for nexon games!!! you may encounter issues connecting, its because you must search for the nexon website, find the launcher, download and then retrieve your game.PRO's - decent community, female players be cautious some of the male players kinda get creepy at times (personal experience with a few friends of mine) - combat gets a little fun higher up in levels. lower level players are best advised to focus on one main talent upon rank 1, then branch off. -active playerbase (although decaying slowly but surely. I came from the Oldest server, Tarlach.)- Guilds are pretty fun and really beneficial for levels and help to having people for boss raids.CONS -PVP is NEVER balanced. it shifts to whatever Nexon is fantisizing about. example: for the first years it was Archery, then it became magic, then it became guns, then it became whatever else came out.-Graphics and textures are extremely dated. Nexon and it's development teams Do NOT put in any extra effort to modernize this game and help bring veteran players back.- Nexon is absolutely garbage at bug fixes. they hold maintenance mainly to help fix broken player accounts, and to prepare the server for a holiday event or a plain event they are hosting. - microtransactions EVERYWHERE. Its terrible how OP you can get by dumping a couple hundred bucks into it.-Player hosted markets tend to be dominated by those monopolizing a certain item for their own benefit, normally things like Dyes for your clothes, etc. can also be valuable quest resources.-treatment based on location. Nexon is a korean company that mostly invests into the community in korea. You will still to this day find unfinished translation work on certain abandonned NPC's, road signs and locations. They dont sincerely seem to give half a crap about the NA. AU and EU servers. Conclusion: judging from my experience with nexon, Mabinogi isn't a game of focus anymore, just a good way of making money. Nexon is a company that earned itself a bad reputation early on in.;Recommended;292.1;1/06/2018;61;5
Nexon;Mabinogi;Action, Adventure, Casual, Massively Multiplayer, RPG, Simulation, Free to Play;None;An Anime-stlyed mmorpg, point and click style.Be what you want and do what you want.While I may not have many hours here on steam, I mainly played the game prior to having it on steam.I would recommend this game to any of my friends, and if Tarlach server is joined - then I'll be willing to help people out.Mabinogi is an MMORPG, with the following unique features:- CombatNow, you may think "Combat, every game has that".While this is true, Mabinogi incorporates many forms of combat, such as:* Martial Arts* Ninja Skills* Magic* Alchemy* Puppeteer* Melee* Range* Gunslinger* Lancer / Knight* and more!!- QuestsThe Quests is Mabinogi vary from doing something as simple as gathering items, to something as crafty as making an item. They even go to as complicated as following a series of mini-quests and dungeons in order to complete the Quest.- HousingNow, the "Housing" in Mabinogi is not your usual home-like area.The "Homestead" that you own from level 10 onwards, is actually different for everyone depending on their tastes. There are three locations to choose - Human area which is Grasslands, the Elven area which is a Desert, and finally the Giant area which is Snow.While you get to choose your location, when you level your Homestead up (yes, it has levels!) - you can then build more unique structures. Everyone's Homestead will be different.- RacesThere are three Races to choose from, upon your initial character creation.Human. Giant. Elf.Each Race will of course have bonuses and different specialties.For example - Humans are the only ones who can use two swords.Elves are extremely amazing Archers, while the Giants have more Health and Strength, and more powerful 2-handed weapons.- Marriage & FamilyYes, in Mabinogi there is a Marriage system.You can get Married to the opposite Gender, or even the same Gender!As for Family - If you get Married, you can create a Family.A Family can consist of yourself and your partner, and up to 6 Children.There is a Family Rule that can be set (example: No dropping items). It will reeset every week I believe, and it will show a counter for those who break the rule.- Pets / MountsYou can obtain Pets and Mounts in-game.Most of the better ones are from the Cash Shop (NX / Karma Koin).Some pets are simply just that - Pets. Both a Pet and a Mount will have inventory for you to store your items. Mounts on the other hand, can be land-based, or have the ability to fly as well.- Rebirthing"Rebirth" is something unique this game offers. You can Rebirth every so often up to level 1000 Total, from there onwards you will actually need to Rebirth every week or purchase character cards to use to Rebirth.Rebirthing a character will give you the option to change your character appearance, level, age and even gender!- LevelsThere are two variants of levels in Mabinogi.Your level, which is basically your "combat" level. Everything you do will earn you exp, which will contribute to this level.There is also Exploration levels. To level this up, you basically have to do Exploration Quests, or go out into the Wilds in Iria (Elves and Giant area), and search for unique hidden objects and items, which you can trade in for EXP and Gold.To level up anything, you will need AP which can be granted upon every level up.The higher your ranks go in a skill, the more AP it will require to level up.- RanksSkill ranks go from the following order (worst to best)NoviceFEDCBA987654321 - Max RankAnd now, to my favourite part...- Non-Combat SkillsNon-Combat Skills are extremely variable.Want to spend your time Cooking tasty treats? Become a Chef!Feel like crafting your own Clothes? Become a Tailor!Want to laze around and spend your time Fishing? Then do so!There are many non-combat skills to find and master.The one unique one which makes Mabinogi different than other games, is simply my favourite.Musical Instruments & Composing.You can re-create songs inside of Mabinogi.Want to play Skyrim Theme? Done.Want to play Game of Thrones theme tune? Done.Pokemon Battle Theme?

Nexon;Hyper Universe;None;None;A great game from a crap publisher. But all publishers are crap nowadays, so that's nothing new. I recommend at least trying it out and see if it's to your liking. Better to play this game for free than throw away your money by buying a game from EA, a remarkably worse publisher.Pros:-Fun, skill-based gameplay-Relatively balanced so far. big (and satisfying) comebacks possible-No pay-to-win elements currently-Good variety of characters on launch (around 40)-Nice variety in items to compliment or change how a character plays-Items are not set in-game. no need to sit at base deciding what to get-Excellent controller support-Good artwork and satisfying sound design-Well-written character backstories for flavor reasonsNeutral:-Gameplay is somewhat akin to fighting games like Street Fighter-PvP matches last 15-25 minutes. An investment, but shorter than most MOBAs-Serviceable in-game graphics/visuals-Decent voice actingCons:-Infamously greedy and uncooperative publisher (Nexon) known for ruining and/or shutting down past games-Somewhat grindy (sometimes impossible) to get skins and emotes unless you spend money.-The game trailers are pretty trash-In-game currency accumulation is ABYSMAL. You can barely afford to pay for cube dismantling and equipment without going in the red. I could only imagine how long it would take to get a single character through earnings alone. The "GP Boost" event going on currently does not help very much, and only serves to accentuate the problem in the first place.Hopefully I didn't forget anything. I will edit in more points I have as I play.Edit: Before I said to not give money until Nexon proved itself worthy. Now that some time has passed, I am retracting that statement. Nexon hasn't really done anything for the game yet, but neither have they degraded the game since launch (No comment on occurences prior to launch). As of now the game is worth spending money in depending on your investment into the game, just remember that Hyper Universe is still in its prepubescent stage right now.;Recommended;168.6;21/01/2018;50;3

Nexon;Hyper Universe;None;None;I seldomly write reviews but I felt compelled to for Hyper Universe. I have never been a fan of side scrollers. I've played them here and there but that's about it. I've put 24 hours into this game in the last 4 days. Yes, I know, my life is a sad one. But beyond that, the game is actually a lot of fun to play. Take a MOBA, a fighting (lite) game, put it on a map like donkey kong, and have at it. It's not p2w but beyond level 10 there is definetely a slow down in hyper (their term for character) unlocks. Via the tutorial and leveling up your account you get 4 pre-determined hypers and 2 or 3 free choice unlocks. You'll also get roughly 90k in gold. Each hyper unlock is 15k. Beyond this, it's mostly just gold gained from matches and that seems to be about 100-500 with various quests you complete that award 500g. TLDR: Fun game, colorful and retro art style, challenging but not too hard, doesn't seem to be p2w, I've had fun with it and I'm an MMO player so you know I'm miserable and always chasing the high of the next game.;Recommended;44.6;4/02/2018;32;4
Nexon;Hyper Universe;None;None;PLEASE GIVE THIS GAME A TRY!It really is a good game. You can tell a lot of love was put into it, and the developers give it so much of their attention. The action is very satisfying, and you don't need to spend a single dime to have fun: you can unlock characters and buy equipment with in-game currency. the only thing you absolutely have to use real money to buy is some skins (and if you're willing to wait for skin coupons, you can get those free, too~).Hyper Universe's biggest problem is that there just AREN'T ENOUGH PLAYERS. We need you! If you want to know what to expect realistically, wait times for AI matches (4 people vs. 4 AIs) are about 1 minute, and wait times for Regular matches (4 people vs. 4 people) are about 5-10 minutes. Not too bad...but wait times for Ranked matches and other game modes are insanely long, simply because we NEED MORE PEOPLE! Please give this game a chance, and spread the word! HU is young, it's good, and it has potential! It's even on Xbox now! Don't let it perish for something as silly as lack of attention!;Recommended;381.4;8/08/2018;28;4

Nexon;Hyper Universe;None;None;A lot of people post negative reviews about this game based on a few things, so I'll refer to those first:1. Censorship - HU is primarily a fanservice MOBA, and although changes have been made, it's really just people exaggerating over the matter. It remains a fanservice MOBA and the changes were negligible - ChaosD1, aka the MMO grinder has put it the best way in his review of the game.2. MOBA clone - with triple digit hours into the game, I call BS. HU is one of the most innovative MOBAs out there, with actually interesting skill kits and a gameplay that supports teamwork! No more steamrolling through an entire team with a fed 1-man army.So, on to the good part: it's a game that is genuinely fun to play. Its 2D nature makes it feel more like DFO than Maplestory, but its dedication to the tower defence module is there to be seen, following the bright tracks of HotS. I, for one, recommend it for every player out there who wants to let off some steam. Feel free to judge after playing.P.S: The community in this game rocks, join the discord if you're into HU.;Recommended;386.9;17/01/2018;78;5

Gameloft;Asphalt 9: Legends;Racing;R$ 00,00;Edit 1: 2/22/24There is now 4 kinds of season passes, 2 of them only covers half the season.Should you want to get all these passes, you're looking at around 50 £€$ every 28 day season. Latest pass gives selcted cars 1 extra rank boost, making it an even harder pass to skip.__________________________________________________________________________Since this game is a newish release on steam, it does not reflect 3 1/2 years and 1000s of hours played on my part.First of all, do you have a_lot of time, or 10.000£€$ to spend on a game, you may enjoy this Arcade of a racing game.The first year or 2, this game was fairly accessible, even to new players. The past 1-2 years, this game has taken a huge turn for the worse, and it's all due to the devs makinging the game P2W and at times, even pay to participate.If you want a top 10% car, you should expect to spend 100$ easely just to get it, and a 1000$ more to get it at a rank that make it useful in MP or events. Just the One car.You can, if you don't mind spending 6-8h daily, grind your self to some competitiveness in the lower leagues f2p.At first, the game appear very accessible, cars come easy if you grind, even in game currency, if you make sure not to spend any of it for a long while. You see, this game is designed on purpose to get you hooked, much like Drugs. Your first hits are free, and you get some feeling of progression. This will very soon come to a hard halt, as you've face the 90 degree pay wall. You may feel some progression after this if you are f2p, but only if you spend tons of time doing repetetive races for prizes with an average 8% droprate. 8% droprate on a single blueprint, you typically need 150 or more of to max the rank of a car. These aren't even the best cars mind you.Should you feel tempted to spend real money on the game, keep in mind, drop rates are in fact drop chances. You could spend 50$ on a pack that could give you a very small part of a car, but drops aren't even guaranteed.I am writing this review in hopes to spare my fellow gamers the agony of getting this game. If you want further insights into the daily life of an A9 gamer, browsing A9 sub reddit will confirm much of what I have written in this review.All I can say is, if you let this game pass on into obscurity, you will be happier for it;Not Recommended;188.6;6/03/2023;82;2

Gameloft;Asphalt 9: Legends;Racing;R$ 00,00;This game is Pay2Win. It features a large amount of micro-transactions.BUTThe core actual game?Fun. Iv had, at time of review, 7 hours of actually enjoyable fun gameplay for $0. If there comes a time where I feel I cannot progress without money, thats when ill uninstall. For now, the game is fun.Im recommending this game under the guideline that your an adult who can resist microtransactions.EDIT:So, im now notably further into the game, another 16 hours and iv spent about $8USD.Im still enjoying the game and that $8 was spent on a battlepass and a couple $1 start bundles.So my dollar to hour ratio is less than $1 per hour.The game is still very enjoyable but im starting to feel the grind. I did read somewhere else that completing the Career mode as a free to play player takes about 12 months and thats fine by me. Knowing that, I will no longer spend any additional money on the game. $8 for a mobile game is about the right price point for me.EDIT 2:This game slaps. The career mode is fantastic and I love the amount of progress you make from doing the weekly events.EDIT 3: Its been another 12 hours and im still enjoying the grind of this game. I really enjoy how the Career mode and Showcase mode regularly intertwine if you want to progress the fastest.EDIT 4: Its been 7 real life days since the last edit, I have still not spent a penny more than the original $8 listed above and im still having a blast with the game.EDIT 5: Another 2 weeks as past and I just got the steam acheivment for staring up 30 cars. I have 27 cars in total. I play a little less now mostly because at my level, its hard to find a club. All the top end clubs dont want me and all the newbie clubs are beneath me and full of players who quit after a couple days.So I login, do a few daily things, few attempts at where im at with career mode and maybe ill play some multiplayer while watching youtube. Its still fun but the initial hype is dying down for me.EDIT 6: THE FINALok, I got all the steam acheivments, bye bye.

Gameloft;Asphalt 9: Legends;Racing;R$ 00,00;Asphalt 9: Legends (Steam Version) by Gameloft** MY PLAY TIME ON WINDOWS STORE VERSION -> 100+ HOURS **-=[PROS]=-__________- Fun arcade racing, similar to Burnout series of games- Very nice graphics, the game is decently optimised and will work on lower-end machines with smooth framerate- A lot of cars to collect and customize*- Small install size (~5GB at the time of this review)- Somewhat addicting- Car models are decent- Accesibility options. Auto-drive, auto steering and braking. You can just sit back and give commands to your car.-=[CONS]=-__________Here is a perfectly fun and good game ruined by corporate greed gone over the roof. This game is a mobile port, which in itself isn't a bad thing except that it brings the worst mechanics of mobile games to the PC.- Energy System for Cars: Every car has it's own amount of Gas, allowing you to do a few races before you need to wait 15 minutes before being able to use that car again. But wait! Higher-ranked cars have refuel time up to 8 hours!!! Add to that that some races can be finished in LESS than 30 seconds. That's right, a car that you probably spend 100s of euros to obtain, you can only drive it for a few minutes PER 8 hours. - Energy System for Events: The greed doesn't end with gas system. In addition to your cars losing gas after every race, doing events costs you event tickets, of which you only get 10 of. One ticket is replenished every 10 minutes, and a single event race can require up to 3 event tickets.- Does this game have your favorite car in it? You can't buy it. In fact, You cannot buy any car. You must grind for car "cards" to unlock cars.- Everything is a Lootbox aka "Card Pack" with very low chances of giving you anything good.- Cars can require more than 50 cards to unlock, and further 100+ cards to max out. You can't choose which cards you get, they are random from Card Packs, which can contain 100+ cards for different cars.- As if Car Cards aren't enough, if you unlock some of the best cars, you also need to buy a car key to use them, and I don't mean buy with in-game currency, oh no, there's card packs for that.- Car customizations are also locked behind card pack lootboxes.- Physics are animated poorly. The car wheels do not steer when you do, and your car is visibly floating on the track in some races.- Forced joining of Clubs or else you miss out on "many" rewards. Problem is, clubs are limited to 20 players max, and they only want Pay-To-Win players in them, so you will get kicked out. A lot.- AI is rigged. AI cars will always catch up to you no matter how fast your car is, until you reach 90% track completion, then, they slow down and allow you to win, if the RNG favors you.- For a game using real-life cars, none of them have any real-life stats. All the stats are fake and made up. The cars don't even have a manufacture year.- Upgrading higher ranked cars will annihilate your credits in two or three clicks. If that's not enough, each car has unique import upgrades, just for that specific car, with abysmal droprate from the card pack.- Career races will require you to own hard to get cars.- Game is extremely grindy even without the double energy system.- Multiplayer is pay to win to the very core of what Pay to Win means.- Most tracks are very short, less than 1 minute long to complete.- What are laps?- You cannot restart the race if you mess up, gotta burn that gas! Oh and your event tickets will be wasted too. You literally can't afford to mess up unless you have a credit card nearby.- Car ranks make no sense. a Rank D car can and will be as fast or even faster than a Rank C or Rank B car, however you cannot use a Rank D car to race against Rank C or Rank D cars, unless it's a career race, then the game will happily throw Lamborghinis and Ferraris to compete with your Dodge Challenger.- Gas recharges automatically once per day, which means unless you click to manually refuel your car before you quit the game, you can leave your car at 1 out of 6 gas left, come back after a few hours only to have your car still at 1 out of 6 gas left. You have to do this for every car.-=[MY OPINION]=-A very decent arcade racer, ruined by pure uncontrolled corporate greed. The game is fun, plays like a Burnout game, kockdowns are neat, car models are great but none of that matters because you only get to experience this for around 10 odd minutes, per hour. People have begged Gameloft since 2018 when this game came out to at least remove the gas system, to no avail. If you are a car enthusiast this game will infuriate you with inaccuracies and rigged AI that constantly checks if you car is "eligible" to win according to it's performance score. Why do I have 100+ hours in this game? Because I thought it would get better. Does it? No. It gets worse as you get decent cars that suck because you can't upgrade them without spending a lot of time or money on lootboxes to obtain parts to do so.P.S.: Gameloft execs, you can improve this review by watching an ad.

Gameloft;Asphalt 9: Legends;Racing;R$ 00,00;A9 is a TERRIFIC CA$H GRAB ...which isn't just P2W but also Pay to Play!  Pros ** Pretty colours** Decent car variety and design** Mostly works with a controller** Works on Linux with Proton enabled** Achievements exist Cons ** Doesn't respect your time!** Doesn't respect your wallet!** Main menu songs get repetitive, fast!** Interface designed to constantly remind you how much worse off you are as a regular user vs if you had the "Legendary" pass or Bundle pass.** Progress saved in the cloud, AKA someone else's computer. ** AI designed to punish you if you have the wrong car and lack upgrades.** Gameplay is simplistic, which could've been interesting, but here it's to the point where even if you do most things right, the AI will almost always catch up and overtake you, seemingly out of nowhere. ** Flow and progress interrupted and ultimately halted by microtransactions. Neat!** Cars need fuel. You pay for fuel by waiting several minutes for each car that's being refueled, during which you cannot use any of them. Gosh, how I do positively love waiting for no reason... ** They have a 0.99$ bundle that's great to lure you in but gives almost nothing of real value when compared to every mechanic in the game that's designed to frustrate you into buying your way out!** Player briefly rewarded with trinkets for playing on different days in order to promote daily log-in habit. Very rewarding, indeed.** Multiplayer and several other features are locked behind a paywall. But, you see, the progression system can be *ahem* tweaked with a bit of real world currency.

Gameloft;Asphalt 9: Legends;Racing;R$ 00,00;Look. It's complicated.The game can be fun - I've made memorable experiences. It looks alright. I made good friends through this game. But if I look past the nostalgia and look at it for what it is now, there's no way I can give this game a positive review. The game is freemium. It's free so you can download it and hop right in but if you want to progress you have to pay with money, ads or time. And lots of that. Pricing is abysmal and Gameloft keeps finding ways to increase the money you have to pay to actually have an enjoyable time. You progress via a gacha-system where you pay premuim currency to open packs and hope you get something useful (with low odds of actually getting what you want).Gameplay-wise the game is meh at best either. The game's physics are absolutely horrible. And although that's probably the most fun aspect to me, it's absolutely infuriating and punishing to get fudged by the game even though you're not doing anything wrong. The game isn't challenging either and Gameloft removed any additional challenge you could oppose on yourself by changing the "recommended" car rank you should have to a required rank you need to have to even play. Because of that none of the races are actually challenging - you have to have no idea what you're doing to have a chance at losing. You're basically stuck in a loop of grinding for upgrades/new cars so you can progress and get new ways of grinding. As soon as you hit that point where you're locked from playing if you don't grind the "fun" part of the game stops. Sure multiplayer can be fun but you need a good account with competitive cars and you won't get that if you start to play now.Cross-platform isn't a thing. By playing on steam you're using the same leaderboard as the windows store version. So you can transfer your account from windows to steam, but if you played/want to play on mobile you would have to ask customer support and you can only transfer your progress once so you can't play on PC and phone at the same time.The graphics look decent but you have to remember that it's a mobile game port so you won't get breathtaking eyecandy. The soundtrack is made up of licensed music. The songs are pretty good but there aren't that many tracks so you'll get tired of them after 10 hours max. The car engines sound horrible. There are some fun features like the Club Clash where your in-game club competes against another club but for that to be fun you need competitive cars you probably won't get as a new player for maybe 2-3 years if you don't spend money (I played for 4 years and don't have a lot of competitive cars).If you played on windows (or xbox?) before and want to switch to steam for whatever reason, you can go for it. I didn't notice anything different from the windows version. But for people who never played this game before, I can't recommend it at all. You'll have fun to play for an hour, maybe two. If you get too hooked, you'll lose hundreds of dollars on this game and regret it later. You won't get much more from this. Unless you can travel back to 2018, you won't ever be competitive (except for if you're given a good account by someone else, which is technically against TOS). Do yourself a favor and play a fun arcade racer like NFS Hot Pursuit or Trackmania. Or watch paint dry. That's also more fun.;Not Recommended;127.8;29/09/2022;49;3

Gameloft;Asphalt 9: Legends;Racing;R$ 00,00;There is a beautiful alternate universe out there where I worship this game as the second coming of Burnout 3: Takedown I've wanted to play for a literal decade of my life, because what is here is really good, it's got the hype ass soundtrack, it's got the grippy controls that are easy to understand, it's got takedowns, it's got nitro, it's got the V I B E I want to see so badly in more racing games... ...But instead we live in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkey's paw wish granting universe where this came out as a F2P game where AI regularly rubber bands to cheat you into thinking that you need to take part in the frankly obnoxious monetization this game has. The UI is also obnoxious, there is like a near-computer virus ridden website level of popups telling you to do ♥♥♥♥ and buy ♥♥♥♥ and the fact that they don't have a retry race button without leaving the race itself sucks. Granted, I do intend on getting into this game, because of everything in the first paragraph of this review, but I immediately can tell you that the only reason I'm gonna play more of this is because it is my taste in racing games down to a bullseye and I am starving for racing games like this, but that's not going to be enough for me to give this game a thumbs up considering you won't even let me play it at my leisure because of the car gasoline timegating.Gameloft, I wish there was like a "Get everything in the game pack" where I can hand you $60 (which I would be willing to do, right now) and not have to deal with any of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you put in this game. Because you DO have an excellent game here hidden underneath all this monetization, but you are actively strangling it's potential in a disturbingly violent fashion as one of the most fun arcade racers ever made because you want this to be a mobile F2P game with aggressive monetization. I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.If they JUST removed the gas requirement timegate then that would be enough to recommend this albeit begrudgingly, but, respectfully, ♥♥♥♥ you if you won't even let me grind my way into making this game playable.;Not Recommended;5.0;20/08/2022;98;6

Gameloft;Modern Combat 5: eSports FPS;Action, Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer;None;I wanted to wait until I beat the campaign to make a review, and I have -- under great frustration. First off, this game is pay to win. There is no reasonable way to get a weapon better than Tier 4 other than paying. We'll come back to that later.The campaign is alright -- I personally liked Modern Combat 4 better, it felt less silly. But where the story may be lacking, the progression is definitely far worse. In order to progress to new areas, you have to obtain a certain number of stars -- Three stars to a level based on objectives, with a minimum of 1 for completion. Let me say now that the campaign is absolutely an extra accessory of the multiplayer -- you are forced to play multiplayer matches in order to progress. If you play league matches, you're mostly fine -- You're placed with people in your level range with weapons that match yours (until later, will get to that). Bronze and Silver league are the good spots where you'll find even and exciting matches. However, the campaign makes you play unranked matches in order to obtain stars, and so you'll find yourself, a Bronze player with low tier weapons and low armor, playing against Platinum players. It honestly sucks. It is as if they are forcing you to use other means to progress -- why it took me the 16.9 hours that it did (my time at the publication of this review). I had to pay for the last area with in game currency that took days to accumulate because some of the campaign stars are pure unobtainium, unless you got lucky with multiplayer matches. And if you did, what happens when the game doesn't save your progress because of server errors?I had my recent progress not saved a few times, which lost me a ton of in game currency and weapons, and I lost access to an area and multiplayer mode because of it. There's no way to manually save to the server, and sometimes Gameloft's servers don't work. It also makes it so you can't redeem daily missions or unlock crates.Once you move up in the multiplayer league, you better have Tier 5/6+ weapons, or you're screwed. Gold league is the limbo point, where you are matched with players with ridiculously better gear, and the more you lose, the more your team loses, even if you join in the last minute, your score goes down and you risk being kicked to Silver league -- Which might be nice. I find that I'll be the top player on my team with 10 kills and I'll still take negative league scores, damaging my rating. It is demoralizing. The answer is simple: Get better weapons. The method is where it turns complicated, or actually even simpler. pay for it. You get "Combat packs" for free, which give you low tier weapon blueprints, and once you have all Tier 4 and below weapons, it turns into almost worthless diamond dust. If you want weapon packs, you need to shill out a high premium. Pay for credits, get VIP status, get new weapons -- Pay to win players are treated as royalty and forget about everyone else.Lastly, Gameloft has load screen messages, one of which I find hilarious. "We love talking to our players, get in touch with us!"This is a feat in of itself. I tried very hard to contact Gameloft regarding my progress not being saved and losing tons of items and in-game currency. Their support page didn't have my laptop, a Dell Vostro, so I couldn't select that when sending my message, making it impossible unless I lied about my device. Their forums wouldn't let me post after I signed up, so I couldn't report it there. Finally, when I did get through to their support, they only addressed my comments about gameplay, and not my actual technical concerns.To conclude, I will say this -- I will continue to play, because I have invested so much time into it already. Does this mean that you should play it? No. There are far better F2P games that aren't mobile ports.EDIT: After writing this, I tried to play more but the game was just so boring and broken that I couldn't make it past another full hour without the campaign to give me something to do.;Not Recommended;17.8;21/12/2018;50;1

Gameloft;Dungeon Hunter 5;Action, Adventure, Free to Play, RPG;None;If torchlight and Diablo 3 had a baby and turned that baby into a glorified phone game..... this is what this game would be. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't a port. I tried reviewing this as a F2P game but even then it's pretty mediocre. The tutorial is tedious and an obnoxious set of tasks that you are forced to do and, you can't even equip the items you earn during the tutorial. Basically, the tutorial is made for people who are completely clueless.The game is set just like a phone game. You have gems you earn from completing tasks or buying them. The same goes for energy, you must gain over time or buying them. You collect daily rewards like signing in daily or completing certain tasks. You can evolve or fuse your gear to upgrade them. This is not the kicker. I honestly could be fine with all this since it's F2P if the gameplay was great.The game focuses on you playing with another player but, "solo play" is you teaming up with a random player lol. The combat is very simple with only 3 skill attacks, 2 equipped weapons, and a roll action plus health potions. The actual combat feels smooth and I am a fan of the Torchlight and WoW-type graphics. The kicker is that each mission/round is only 2 minutes long with 15-20 enemies max. Also, the 2-3 items you gain are instantly inserted to your inventory. Besides the smooth combat and decent graphics, it lacks everything you'd want in an aRPG. If you judge this against POE, it's laughable tbh.

GungHo Online Entertainment;Let It Die;Action, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;Good bits- Aesthetics and music are top tier. Tower radio in particular is genius and somewhat helps against the numbness of grind. All the songs from different artists also seem to be tailor made for the game, so they really put effort in there. The introduction, the tutorial videos, characters, the arcade, all that jazz is pure gold. Weapons in general are imaginative and fun to use: trying out something like Motor Psycho’s charge or rage attacks for the first time was amazing. Aesthetics is the main thing that carries this game through its less stellar bits.- Some clever emergent gameplay gimmicks like cooking animals with fire weapons or dropping poison slugs to poison yourself and heal through a decal that turns poison into HP gains. Mushrooms in general are very fun to use due to their powerful and varied effects.- Few great boss fights. First proper boss at 10F is truly ass clenching due to first having a platforming / enemy challenge, second one also has nice gimmick as well and third also manages to shake things up.- Speaking of arseclenching, later areas with limited access to elevators become very intense treks when you’re on your last legs in terms of remaining gear and trying to do with what you can to finally get to a checkpoint without dying.- I’m one of the people who suffered no bugs or slowdowns whatsoever (apart from endlessly scrolling news at launch which apparently was patched) and I don’t even have a good rig, so for me this was a great PC port.Bad- On the other hand there’s a problem with recycled bosses and enemies for the duration of the entire game. In the first area you’re introduced to basic human enemies named Screamers and various type of robotic Tubers and a handful of mid-bosses. Hope you like them a lot since the entire game will be using them forever: 1 human enemy type, 5 robotic enemies and 4 bosses. Even major bosses are recycled mid-bosses. That’s very little content to stretch into one game taking dozens of hours, hundreds if you get roped into post-game grind. Granted, in new areas the basic screamers have different locale specific gear and the robots or mid-bosses sometimes get new moves, but it doesn’t change the fact you’re essentially fighting the same foes over and over again with only minor variations.- The game also has bit of a poor tutorial that usually dumps everything on you at once so many beginners don't know basic stuff like how to best spend the low amount of premium currency they get at the start or seldom as login or other bonuses (upgrading the ridiculously small starting storage should be top priority) which kind of forces you to constantly look up guides or discussions which takes you out of the game yet again. You'll start drifting towards the "meta" in order to not waste the premium currency and rare metals you got by pure chance or grinded for hours.- It would be falsehood to claim the game doesn't have any P2W aspects since some premium boons are rather ridiculous, most notable of them being 10 more inventory slots on every character class. This allows you to carry plenty more weapons, armor or consumables in a game where DURABILITY and INVENTORY MANAGENT are always salient issues. This essentially removes the main downside of non-Collector classes or makes Collector an even better hoarder. Instant revives for premium currency are tiny in comparison. Sure, if you're bad or lacking in gear and items you're going to get your shin kicked in regardless, but even a half-decent paying player gets so much compared to any free players if they pay for certain key “conveniences” and use them intelligently. Are they required for game completion? Absolutely not. Are they extremely powerful? Very much so.- Decal system that essentially acts as stat boosting character upgrades: you normally lose decals on death if you don’t pay for revive (normal or premium currency), but the more expensive premium decals that you can also buy with in-game currency act as permanent upgrades since they are never lost on death, even if you use the much cheaper normal recovery mechanic, i.e. personally hunting down your previous character. In addition the premium decals stack with non-premium versions of themselves, say for example two 40% HP increases stacked together. The premium decals you get are also completely random so you might get stuck with bad ones and duplicates or receive one of the game breaking decals by chance. It's lootboxes that you can buy either with in-game or premium currency, and purchases with latter also come with guaranteed minimum rarity for the decal you get. Lootboxes in form mushroom stew that is!- What eventually killed the game for me was not the lack of variety, or the difficulty reducing P2W mechanics on their own, but the absolutely ludicrous mid-late game material grind, which is the single worst motivation killing aspect of this game, as later on it turns areas into gear checks and proceeding forward becomes very, very difficult if not outright impossible until you luck out on blueprint, rare material drops or a handful of the completely gamebreaking mushrooms like time slow or invisibility / invincibility. Or just look up online where you can farm stuff. The game doesn’t so much have a semblance of balance as much as progression being near completely gear gated through tiers. At one point you’re struggling against basic enemies doing no damage and dying in a hit or two, but once you break the magical character or gear tier threshold you suddenly mop the floor with everything you come across. For example the Tier 2 Iron gets a massive 5x DMG increase the moment you manage to upgrade it to Tier 3. While relying on enemy gear works in early game, later on you realize you can only truly work with items you create at the blacksmith: both because of their much higher damage output and durability / ammo count, important not only for more easily dispatching enemies and making you beefier, but because few good weapons and armor use much less inventory space than many bad ones. Built gear also gets very expensive from mid-game onward, meaning that even if you decide to recover a dead character manually without KC payment, you have to still grind KC for the gear of the character doing the recovery. Imagine every piece of weapon and armor costing around 10k. I got to 30+ floors, which apparently is the final area barring post-game, and lost all motivation to play after realizing just how much time I was wasting on running back and forth from spawn to certain spots in order to have a chance at receiving materials I was looking for (loot only resets after returning to main hub) so I could finally break into 4-star gear tier, or doing repetitive and easy TDM between actual runs for money to kit my characters again at the blacksmith or in hopes of lucking out at good decals (from Mushroom Stew) and unique bag rewards. KC rewards from normal exploration are tiny in comparison to the game’s PvP mode, but the latter is just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetitive and easy until you hit Diamond rank.ConclusionsIf you want something with Soulsy combat or other vaguely similar gameplay elements that you can leisurely grind to your heart’s desire for better modifiers and bigger numbers, but without an economy built around a cash shop there’s Nioh. Or Diablo-likes such as Grim Dawn. If you want roguelikey elements with a semblance of permanent progression regardless of failures there’s games like Everspace, or for strategy FTL, Darkest Dungeon and Invisible Inc. for that as well. When LET IT DIE manages to be fun and unique it is peak entertainment, but the great parts are few and far in between of all the menial grind and farming you have to do, which also gets worse as you get more invested into the game.

GungHo Online Entertainment;Let It Die;Action, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;this game has been a repeated victim of unfair representation in the mainstream gaming media due to surface level understanding of how it actually works. it's unfortunate because what let it die accomplishes is really unique.let it die, on its surface, is a live service game with premium currency paid revives, with clumsily implemented "souls-like" combat and a focus on grinding for materials and resources. if you only played for about 3 hours, this is honestly a very easy and not entirely unreasonable opinion to arrive at. however, these things are all only half truths.let it die is a live service game, however - barring the fact that progression might accidentally be artificially extended if you did - this game could be played as a fulfilling and unique singleplayer experience if the servers were shut off tomorrow. in the game, you ascend what's called "the tower of barbs" which is the games entire singular location. it has over 100 floors, however what is considered the main base game is floor 1-40, after which defeating the final boss on floor 40 entitles you to post game content.for posterity, at the time of this review i have just ascended to floor 30, with the 3rd major boss out of 4 total to still be defeated when i feel prepared. this is over the course of about 100 hours of gameplay. i think to beat the first boss on my original first play attempt on PS4 during release, when information was much more limited, it took about 15 hours of gameplay. a LARGE majority of my playtime has been spent still in the base game, and other than buying a monthly pass for free elevator rides maybe twice in the 100 hours across 2 years of playing on PC on and off, i've never spent money on reviving my character a single time.the player revival mechanic costing $0.50 cents has been a hot button topic when this game was discussed in games journalism when it was new, and from release til now one thing has remained consistent if you have played to at least the first boss. this is an unbelievably bad and unnecessary noob trap and is not encouraged by the game other than completely ironically through tounge-in-cheek "insurance sales" pitches from a pretty lady.to break it down, when your character dies, your character turns into a "hater," a husk of your former self that will now roam as an AI controlled NPC in other players' games when they enter the floor you died on. in order to gain use of this character again, you have a few options. you can either, immediately on death, spend the 50 cents in premium currency to resurrect on the spot, OR you can salvage your character back. this can be done immediately from home base by using the in-game currency called kill coins that you naturally accrue through regular gameplay, or for free by using another character to ascend back to the floor you died on and killing your own hater. more often than not, the price in kill coins proportionally to how much you can consistently earn by playing and NOT dying is easily worth the saved time and energy of manually reviving them. reviving them manually can also be a benefit on occasion, as you get to make the same run you just made, therefore earning all the things you earned before your death, and now again as you ascend back up to your furthest reached floor. this is one of many "noob traps" the game has that *seem* like powerful ways for you to spend real money in order to get an advantage, but in reality often only to serve whale players a way to skip some minor occasional tedium or waiting time. fast forwarding R&D/buy timers/upgrades, buying upgrade materials from the daily vending machine, even the non-event cosmetic blueprints they occasionally offer for sale are all ways to trick players into spending money they don't need to if they are willing to actually interface with the systems the game has very carefully put into place in order to keep you from doing that at all.combat, initially is clunky. i felt this when i first played, and even now i can absolutely concede that it has nowhere near the depth or skill expression that combat in any dark souls game has. however, the game does make up for this by providing a very unique and very wide array of weapons to play with that not only suit many play styles, but also provide valuable niches and benefits to counter specific armor and/or enemy types. certain blocks of floors in the tower will be fraught with a certain kind of armor that all the regular enemies happen to wear, encouraging you to experiment with weapon types you may have not tried yet as they will be increasingly strong against that type. the combat being shallow is almost deliberate in order to allow this sort of rock paper scissors equipment system to shine, feeling rewarding when you master a new weapon type both literally by maxing out its mastery score, and figuratively when you learn how to play with it effectively.the game is, without a doubt, interested in making you grind. however, i think this reputation actually unfortunately gets perpetuated by players who eithera) got way too impatient either before beating the first boss, or AFTER beating the 2nd boss and experiencing the games first extreme difficulty spikeor b) are players who are well past the base game, having defeated the final boss long ago and have spent the bulk of their playtime grinding in the post-game "tengoku" floors, where upgrading your weapons and armor a single time can require materials that require hours just to have a chance of finding, as well as "uncapping" your fighters with a tertiary currency that must be intentionally hunted down.the grind element of the game is absolutely present, the game will throw enemies at you in waves after making certain benchmarks in the tower that are sufficiently spiked in power compared to the enemies you were used to. you will need to upgrade armors that fit the area's most common weapon types, as well as weapons that will counter the most common armors. however, i think a lot of people find this to be a harsher wall than it is due to an understandable neglect of game systems on their way to the first initial difficulty spike. before around floor ~25, you hardly, if ever actually *need* to use mushrooms (the buff spells, essentially, of the game) in order to overcome any major challenges. you can often brute force your way with properly upgraded weapons and armor, which at this point are not difficult to upgrade as the threat in the first 10-20 floors is relatively low. however when you hit that first midboss of the 21+ floors, there is a serious numerical spike. enemies hit much harder, can take more blows, and start carrying more difficult to deal with weapons like flame-elemental items. this problem, i learned recently, is alleviated drastically if you use your mushrooms when you need to, you take advantage of the rotating floors of the week to target farm useful materials and money, and you plan ahead. before this point, you practically never have to do so.overall i have a lot more thoughts about this game, and there's so much more to say, but i think what's most important to me is that i clear up a lot of misconceptions about this game and that if you're even slightly interested due to it's engaging aesthetic (like i was), definitely give it a shot and if you're not hooked after beating the first major boss, then you can at least say you gave it a fair shake.;Recommended;152.2;16/12/2023;78;1
GungHo Online Entertainment;Let It Die;Action, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;I wanted to recommend this, I really did. The game has a lot of redeeming qualities, but it's negatives are far too great. Pros:Great wacky yet gritty themes and charm, very Grasshopper.Decent yet slightly clunky soulslike combatFun and diverse weapons, running around killing people with a yoyo in one hand and a clothing iron that blasts steam does not get oldAmazing SoundtrackInexhaustable progression*Decent challengeCons:Insurance lady designed to guilt trip you into paying real money to reviveSlow and painfully tedious progression that you can pay to speed up significantly. It hits a wall that's beyond ridiculous. Progressing past floor 40 once you get there will take probably about as many hours as it took to get to 40 itself, and its all of pure grind for materials doing the same crap over and over that isn't even a challenge for you anymore. it's not worth it.Good premium decals are insanely hard to get without paying and insanely hard to get when paying too, you could drop £300 and not get what you want.Inexhaustable progression* its a con too because it's not done well.Conclusion: My goal for this game was to complete the main 40 floors and then maybe play around with the floors above it for a while depending on how fun I found them. However after finishing floor 40 and seeing the grind ahead just to progress a small bit. I think I am done. It's not worth it.In hindsight, part of me doesn't think completing the main story of the game gave me the payoff I had hoped for, it was underwhelming.I looked past the negative reviews, and predatory monetization model because of the Grasshopper name, and that sense of achievement after completing something "difficult". I also looked past it because of the percentage of players who have played this game and not beaten the main story.I would advise anybody who feels the same as I did going into the game to stop what they are doing and just put the time into another game that deserves it more. The best parts of this game can be experienced in the first 10 hours of play, it doesn't get better than that, only worse. I don't advise investing the time I put into it, there is no payoff.EDIT - DUE TO CRITICISM OF HOURS PLAYED I put this much time into the game because of the reasons I outlined, I started with a goal, and then by the time I wasn't enjoying the game anymore, I was hit with sunken cost fallacy (both time and money that the game managed to pull out of me with psychologically manipulative tactics), and continued on. The game didn't change through a patch that ruined it for me, I just woke up to what the game was.The real measure is not how much time I put into the game, but how much of that time was enjoyed, even frustration can be enjoyable mind you. Think of the first time you ever played a souls game (assuming you like the genre), those intend to provoke your frustrations into conquering the game, it's not real negativity, the challenge is the enjoyment. Though once you strip them down and understand them, they aren't all that challenging to most people.To say you do not put stock in reviews with a good sum of hours is interesting. Maybe you have gotten so used to reading and viewing reviews from people who barely scratch the surface of games? There are no shortage of people who make their living off of playing a game for an hour or two and judging the entire game off of that small bite. The number one criticism of those people? They didn't give the game a chance, they don't know what they are talking about, they are wrong about half the mechanics and systems within the game because they didn't play long enough to understand that almost all their qualms are nought but their own ignorance or things that would have been remedied with an unlock after the first chapters boss.I played this game until the completion of the main story, I played a little further to get a taste of the post-story content, Tengoku. Honestly, had I played any less of this game, I am not sure my review would actually give all that full a picture. You can see what this game is about within a couple of hours, but I played until those feelings were confirmed.Do I think my review is "the correct take"? No. I think it's my take. I think it's my opinion of a game that I deem predatory, a game developed (at least in part) by one of my favourite studios. Anybody is free to dismiss it or heed it, or take it into consideration, those are their rights. I felt it right to type up my thoughts on the game, I rarely write reviews unless I have strong feelings one way or the other.There will always be reviews that get dismissed for playing for either too long, or for not long enough. There is no goldilocks time for writing a review.If you enjoy Let it Die, and don't believe that the monetization is grubby, full of noobtraps and scummery, that's your right. I recommend writing your own review, praising the game.;Not Recommended;233.8;12/04/2020;222;15
GungHo Online Entertainment;Let It Die;Action, Free to Play;R$ 00,00;Disclaimer: I actually love this game, but I also love many other games and lying is possibly the dumbest thing anyone can ever do, so I'm offering you my completely honest and objective opinion about the things at hand, which comes from an experienced player and someone who plans on continuing to play this game. Also, if you like this game, check out the "Elminage" series, "Elminage Original" and "Elminage Gothic" are on steam and you're going to love them.---Do you play games because you want: to have a good time/you enjoy a cool story/some "fun" gameplay/like a good challenge?You may find that experience with this game up to a point, play exactly until you reach Floor 10 (First boss) and then uninstall forever and never look back, you might be tempted to play more, but you shouldn't.You can watch the rest of the bosses and cutscenes on youtube, trust me.If you liked what you saw or if you like Suda51/Grasshopper, consider buying one of the DLC packs just to support the developers.Despite what you might have read this game is NOT "Pay 2 Win", or anything like that, but it's also not for everybody, if you want to read more about this scroll down further.Do you play games because you want to try to overcome some grueling challenges, hardcore stuff that only you and a select few will ever care about?Don't play this, go play a skill based game like a shoot-em-up/STG, rhythm game, or basically anything else, this game is actually very very easy, *insert your favorite "hard game" here* is most likely harder than this by a long shot.This game only gets a little bit difficult once you reach floor 100, which depending on how you play, will take from 300 to 500 hours of grinding if not much more, and no, I'm not kidding or exaggerating. If you play this up to floor 40 (Where the "story" ends) with the mentality that you will quit after floor 40, and not bother with the "End game" content, you're just wasting your time.Do you enjoy mindless grinding and you are also a hardcore masochist?Well, you're right at home and let me explain why.This is a game where progress comes in tiny increments, you cannot sit down and experience a considerable amount of content without grinding.This game is not "Pay 2 Win". at first glance one might think it's possible to pay for a certain things in game, however, the reality is that there will always be a GIGANTIC forced grind for you to do, and no amount of in-game currency is going to fix that.The in-game currency (Death Metals/DM) allows you to do two things, you spend 2 DM for 10 storage slots, which are CRUCIAL to all the insane grinding you will be doing OR you can waste them on reviving a character once.Here's the thing, if you spend DMs on reviving your character in order to hit a boss for 1 damage for 5 hours straight until you kill it after spending 1000 DM, All that is going to happen is that you're going to advance to the next floor, and get completely obliterated again.All this game boils down to is a series of "gear checks", what this means is that the floor after the boss or whatever floor you just wasted DM trying to brute force, is going to be much more "difficult" than what you just got past, so it's a situation where you will not progress.This game has some very obvious walls for gear checks, where most people experience them are floors:16, 21, 23, 30, 33, 36, 38, 40, 50You might look at this and think "That can't be so bad, that seems like a normal difficulty spike in any game and makes sense", What you don't know yet is that the spike from each "wall" is comparable to the sum of all previous walls, in other words, The amount of time you spent getting from 1 to 30, is more or less the same amount of time its going to take you to go from 30 to 40 and so on.Let It Die is not a game to be "experienced", it's a game to be endured.If someone thinks that "Hernia", the in-game currency "material"/"item", shop is "Pay 2 Win", I have to say that I personally would have LOVED if it actually allowed you to pay to win somehow, but what Hernia actually is, is an equivalent to buying a Team Fortress 2 Rocket Launcher for 10 USD on the "Mannco. Store", you just don't do that.Hernia has a randomized stock of items which updates every day, and the stock of the items it carries is LIMITED, which means you can technically only buy 1 piece (or 5 if you are extremelly "lucky") of whatever Materials are in stock.You really don't have to be a genius to realize you will need 200 of this material, not 1 or 5. So trying to pay for items is ridiculously ineffective, the forced grind is inescapable.A ton of games have those little "scams" thrown around, it doesn't matter where you look, Warframe, Overwatch (People actually buy Lootboxes), TF2, etc. but if you somehow fall for it, it's 100% on you.You can also buy premium decals with 10 Death Metals OR 50,000 Kill Coins (non purchasable, in-game currency), but same thing, if you spend DM on this, you're throwing your money into the garbage, the drop-rates are so bad you will never get the decal you need, so it virtually makes no difference if you spend KC instead of wasting DM.DM should only ever be used for "Event" premium decals, like the current "No More Heroes" decals (at the time of writing), but once again, you will only want 1 or 2 out of all the possible decals you may get, and if you aren't wasting your DM, you should naturally have enough for a couple of those decals just from daily rewards and missions.Now that the economy is out of the way, if you still want to commit to this game, make sure you check the wiki so you can start min-maxing the items you will craft from the start, it will really make a big difference, I didn't use a guide until floor 30, because I wanted to know why I couldn't damage the floor 30 boss, just to find out I should've been upgrading the "Iron" weapon just for this scenario.A Wiki will also help you understand how the mechanics actually work and to not waste any of your resources, which seems to be a common trend for people who are new to this game.Also, properly playing this game and using all the advantages it gives you (Like learning how to farm TDM early and using "Gyakufunsha") will improve your early to mid game grinding vastly.Let it Die is very interesting, it might as well be a turn based RPG instead of an action game in a lot of scenarios, to give you an example, you might struggle with this boss due to the natural progression of the game, only to come back to farm it later and find out it dies in 1 hit to your newly upgraded gear.This is something you will encounter consistently, usage of mushrooms, decals, upgraded weapons, will turn almost any fight into something you will get through completely untouched."Difficulty" is very much like an MMO, you just see numbers go up until things actually have enough health in floor 100 for you to not be able to 1 shot them that easily (Though still possible in some scenarios)If you think of the game it is a "carrot on a stick" metaphor, the grinding never, NEVER, gets better, I'm dead serious, at no point it ever gets more enjoyable, more "fair", nothing. If anything, when you're grinding for Materials that only appear on floors 100+ and it takes hours to reach floor 100 in the first place, you realize that the grinding has only got worse.The RNG behind drop rates is soul crushing, you will be farming for MONTHS for a single decal you want thinking you might finally get it this day and it won't happen, you can spend 8 hours straight farming a boss (Shoutouts to JIN-DIE) and get 0 drops of the "Metal" you need, which you need 5+ pieces of for a single upgrade (Out of 4 individual upgrades within 4 tiers total (so, 16 upgrades where you have to farm for materials for each individual upgrade)You may think you've experienced masochist games before, but you haven't tried to reach floor 250 in Let It Die.;Recommended;857.4;2/05/2019;67;4

And I loved every second of itthe game had a wonderfully crafted story, awesome characters, a battle system that until now is one of the, if not THE best Real Time/Turn based hybrid system I have seen and a Soundtrack to die for. I do believe, this is where I started embracing game OSTs, too.now, the old PC version had its share of bugs. a few only immersion breaking, a few only mildly annoying and one game breaking. But since this is based on the ol' Dreamcast version, those should have been dealt with.the only thing missing right now is the Game Arts Jingle at the Start, that always brought a smile to my face in anticipation of whats to come.I'd say if you are a fan of old-school RPGs, and you are up for some wholesome fun, get this.;Recommended;15.1;24/08/2015;187;4

GungHo Online Entertainment;Grandia II Anniversary Edition;Adventure, RPG;R$ 36,99;Short Version:If you played oldschool JRPGs but never played Grandia II, get this game!If you like RPGs and look for an interesting turnbased/realtime combat-system mix, get this game!In my opinion, this is one of the best JRPGs ever made, with quite certainly the best combat system.Longer Version:My gametime doesn't tell, but I played through this game multiple times when it was originally released, so bear with me.Pros:Awesome Storytelling: There are multiple voiced dialogues and this version actually comes with the original Japanese voices, a great plus for me who only knew the sometimes a bit wooden english voiceovers.The story itself is pretty awesome and told in some kind of episodic format with the characters on your team rotating throughout the story, you get to know these characters not only through simple cutscenes, but, what for me at the time was mindblowing, through conversations around the campfire when they are resting. Yes there are multiple games that use this mechanic, but for me Grandia was the first I ever experienced, so it made the whole thing even more enjoyable.The Characters:While all of them are to a certain part classic JRPG tropes like the damsel in distress, the revenge driven clanleader, and the grumpy sellsword, each of them has facettes to their character you would probably not expect on the first glace. Each character has an interesting backstory and evolves a lot during the remainder of the game.The combat system:Ohh boy, where do I start. This system is in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, that has ever been created, the perfect mix between tactical turnbased and realtime combat.Okay nostalgia aside, I still believe this is one of the best systems I ever had the pleasure to play, it builds a lot around tactic instead of pure damage dealing and overlevelling your characters like a ton of other JRPGs. Instead of grinding it's just as effective to wrap your head around positioning, not just of your characters but also your enemies, and timing.While on first look quite simple the system has a lot of depth, with crowd control, animation-cancels, AOE-spells, a counter and a combo mechanic. There are so many different utility items it melts your brain considering the possibilities.And the bossfights are just a blast, the mechanics they employ to make the fights different are amazing. And because of the emergent complexity of the combat system there are multiple ways to kill bosses as well.Gearing and customization:As I said in the combat section already, this game is deep. There are multiple ways to build each character depending on what you are looking for. In the game you can find so called eggs. Think of them as power-items that give your characters special magical abailities. Some are build around healing, others around damage, yet again some around meele and afflictions.While there are the obvious choices some fairly interesting and highly effective combinations are possible.Different weapons in this game can actually affect how a character fights and what he can do, it's important to think about your current team composition as well as their gear and skills when fighting, especially in the bossfights. Oh and do not sell your resistance gear, you will need it.Cons:Yes the game is not perfect, here are some things that people might find annoying:Overpowered Items:I think this is something the new hardmode will (hopefully at some point, when it's more than just 20% more hP for enemies) fix, but there are a few Items in the game that are just insanely powerful. While the maximum damage per attack is capped at a certain level those items can reach those amounts already early in the game and oneshot a lot of enemies and make bossfights significantly easier.Annoying character tropes:If you do not like a Damsel-Priestess and a Tsundere as your main female characters, you are probably going to have a baaaad time. While their characters get deeper later on, especially in the beginning they can be annoying.Slow start:The first hour of the game is dialogues and some 1 or 2 serious fights (there are other fights but you pretty much 2-shot everything). Give the game time, as soon as your party is full and the story gets going the combat system becomes extremely rewarding.Combat camera:This... thing... was/is the only letdown about the combat system. It's not that it makes the game unplayable, it's just annoying, because sometime you do not see everything. But as soon as an enemy acts the camera usually zooms out and shows you what you need to see to make a decision, sometimes it can mess up your tactics though, if you "forgot" there was another enemy.Visuals:I'm glad they took the "HD Remake" off the title. It looks slightly better than I remember and runs on 1920x1080 (with black borders because of 4:3) on solid 30 FPS, but well it looks very, very dated. Also no 60fps, 4k, or widescreen... but... well, it's still pretty damn beautiful!So yeah, do I recommend this: Hell yeah! If you like oldschool JRPGs and never Played this, get it right now.;Recommended;1.1;24/08/2015;125;2

GungHo Online Entertainment;Grandia II Anniversary Edition;Adventure, RPG;R$ 36,99;Grandia is a great game.  Now that I've completed it again, I can tell you it's not just the nostalgia speaking.PROS:- The game has aged surprisingly well.- The combat is fast paced and has light tactical elements- The story is phenomenalCONS:- The Hut of Trials mini game is beyond annoying- There is an issue with playing FMVs, after the fmv has completed the game will hang for about 10 seconds- As with most JRPGs the special attack animations wear out their welcome rather quickly- There are various graphical and animation glitchesFurther explanation of the pros and cons follow.This game has aged well, much better than other classics in the genre.  The graphics are much easier on the eyes than the release date would imply.  The combat is very fun, not until the very end of the game was I skipping fights.  The story has a decent pacing to it.  The third act does outstay its welcome though.  The game just does not seem to know when it should end.  Overall, it's an excellent experience.The Hut of Trials mini game is the worst part of the game and it's not even remotely close.  Let me begin by saying this, I've never enjoyed mini games in JRPGs, so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.  The whole structure of this mini game bewilders me.  You have to talk to someone to get into the Hut, at which point you walk up some stairs and into the hut.  Once inside you're greeted by another dialogue box which then leads you into the cavern where the actual mini game is.  But it doesn't stop there, no, you have to read a stone tablet and then wait for this furry thing to go open the mini game door.  Once inside the mini game, it's a pretty run of the mill JRPG mini game, nothing special.  Once you complete the mini game you go outside and what is your reward?  You get to watch the furry thing(s) dance for ten or so seconds before it opens the exit.  Once you proceed, you must walk to the end of another cave and then be sprung out of the cavern.  You're then greeted by a manimal that gives you your actual reward.  Now, if it was just a one time thing to get all of your rewards from the mini game, that wouldn't be awful, not ideal but certainly not awful.  Nope, you have to go multiple times to get every reward from the mini game.  It's a time consuming, poorly thought out exercise in frustration.  It takes longer to enter and exit the mini game than it does to play it, meaning, you'll never get successive tries, even if you fail.  Another frustrating issue with the game is the bug that causes the game to hang after playing FMVs.  Which only seems to occur after a bit of playtime, it's not going to happen on your first few fights.  It's a huge issue in the later game.  I would honestly say the fights last on average 10-20 seconds longer than they should.  However, the boss battles will last minutes longer than they should.  It's easily fixed by closing the game and opening it again.  The problem, however, lies in the fact that there are set save locations and exiting is not always an option.The special moves outlive their welcome just like any other game in the genre, the problem is compounded by the brief hang after every move that has an FMV in it, which are quite a few.  Nothing surprising here, typical gripe about games in the genre that came out around the same time as this game.The graphics for the most part are solid for the age of the game.  I did, however, notice many instances of the camera clipping through the scenery during cutscenes, animation hangs during cutscenes, and like one or two instances of z-fighting.  Honestly, pretty solid game even given the handful of times these issues occur.Overall, I fully expect the FMV hanging issue to be resolved, the Hut of Trials mini game is only mandatory once, the specials will be fixed along with the FMV bug and the graphical glitches aren't anything to get worked up over. The pros far outweigh the cons.Verdict:  Buy this game!;Recommended;26.6;29/08/2015;73;2

People said all you had to do was disable 60fps in settings, which is true. however after an update that was made, that option was taken away for SOME ungodly reason...maybe Valmar didn't want us to have fun or something. i don't know. AAAAAAANYWHO. the ssolution is simple in these 5 easy steps.Step 1.Go into your Library in steam and either right click grandia 2 on the side tab, or scroll through your library and find the game and go to the cog wheel icon.2.

One of the best games from my childhood that were fortunately ported by GungHo America to Steam. Originally a Dreamcast title released in 2001, ported later to the PS2 in 2002 and later to Steam as the Anniversary Edition in 2015, this classic JRPG still holds well even after 15 years of it's initial release, mostly for it's memorable story and innovative combat system! The story in Grandia II revolves around Ryudo, a Geohound (a sort of bounty hunter in the Grandia universe), moved around from place to place, taking requests the normal folks would generally despise. One day, he received a letter of invitation, or a job request, to escort a band of Sisters of Granas for their usual prayer ritual from the nearby village. Things unfortunately went south and from a basic escort job, Ryudo is now stuck in a potential catastrophic event that may decimate the world. Before moving on to the pros and cons, I would just like to mention that I may be bias in recommending this as this game is held dearly by me as one of my favorite titles ever but I'll try to point out all the positive and negative aspects of this port.PROS As I've mentioned earlier, this game has an absolute BRILLIANT story! The plot itself is captivating with a mind bending plot twist occurring at the second half of the game. I've played a lot of RPGs and I can firmly say that Grandia II has definitely one of the best ones! Every playable characters are surprisingly lovable! From the sarcastic and no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ryudo to the calm and wise Mareg, every character stands out on their own and their lines perfectly matched with their attitude that Game Arts portrayed them to be. One more thing about the characters are their lines. Seriously, read them all if you can! You can find tidbits of Ryudo and Helena's love-hate relationship, Mareg's pearls of wisdom, Millenia's flirty-but-chaotic tone. Even talking with NPCs will net you awesome dialogues between the characters! (PRO TIP: Make sure to talk to everyone at least TWICE. There's always 2 or 3 different conversations you can have each time you talk to anyone)  Innovative and dynamic combat system! I think this one is what separate Grandia II with the other RPGs at the time. What I mean by dynamic is that everyone moves freely in the battlefield during their turn. Instead of the usual turn-based battles (a la ATB from the Final Fantasy series), once the character's turn is reached, they will run forward to their enemy to land the blows. This makes it interesting since the character, implied to both friendlies and foes, can miss or evade just by moving a bit. Also, another interesting mechanic in combat is the Cancel system. Every character have the basic Combo or Critical attack to use each turn. The Critical is weaker from the pair, since it only hit once, but when used when an opponent's turn, it will cancel the said turn, shoving the said opponent queue lower and allows for tactical comeback. Great character's customization via skills and magic equip. In Grandia, magic comes from an equip Mana Egg you'll find across the game. Each have different spells, whether offensive or defensive, and can be equip by anyone, in AND out of battles! So basically, any character can be a healer or damager, with the limiting factors comes only with the mana pool and the character's stats. Same goes with skills, where upon finding and leveling up skill books, you can equip skills to boost the character's ability on what build you decide to use on him/her. Basically an all around decent port with a few minor quirks (I'll list them down in the Cons). During the whole 40 hours of my playtime, the game never crashed on me once. There's also an option to turn on VSync and Anti-aliasing via an external launcher. The game supports both Japanese and English voice over. I used the Japanese voices most of the time since I forgot how cringey the English voice actors sound in the game (still good compared to the other JRPGs at the time though). I switch to English only when there's a plot heavy cut scene comes up because they don't have subs for it. The option is available via the said external launcher. Full controller support (I used the standard XBOX 360 controller) with customizable buttons. An option to play in Hard Mode right off the bat. I suggest going for this since the game is quite easy once you got the hang of the mechanics. A perfect 100% game is moderately easy to achieve in one play. I took a little bit over the 40 hours mark in Hard Mode to complete the game with all the achievements unlocked. Surprisingly, it only took me a a little grind to get the 2000 enemies killed. Of course, you have to look in very nook and cranny for hidden treasures to ensure you didn't missed any specific ones, namely the "Bling" and "Put A Notch in it" achievements.NEUTRAL In combat, the HP bar for ALL enemies is shown clearly to you, even bosses! Bosses with > 9999 HP will be shown as ????/???? but with the bars shown, you can estimate when he's going to die. It's useful but I think it dissolve the suspense that the usual RPG boss fights have. CONS The biggest pet peeve I have with this game is that it doesn't support a native widescreen support. Sure, you can change the resolution and toggle the widescreen option but what it does is just stretch the aging 4:3 camera, making the game unbearably ugly. If the widescreen toggle is turned off, you'll have to settle playing with a letterbox resolution to the end. The Japanese voice over is not sync with the English dialogue. The voice get cuts over prematurely if the text advances way faster than the actual voices. It doesn't happen when you're using the English voice though. Camera controls in the fields and dungeons are frustrating and dizzying at times. Since the developers tend to hid items behind walls, you have to rotate the camera nonstop to spot it and it's annoying. Also, the camera zooms in on Ryudo when you stopped moving even for a second. Some text glitched out passed the text box.  30 FPS-locked. Yeap, it's still there. It's nothing major really but the characters does seems floaty at time during walking. Good thing is that battles runs in fully glorious 60 FPS! That's why it feels fast and frantic at times. Although the game runs smoothly at 30 and 60 FPS, there's a few area (namely the snowy mountains) where the FPS drops a bit. Not really important but I supposed I should mention it. Opening the save and loading screens took ages!  The field interactions are unnecessarily and painfully SLOW! For example, when you're climbing a ladder, everyone will take turns to slowly navigate the ladder and you CAN'T move until everyone's done. Missed something up there? You might as well go and order takeouts in the meantime. Textures sometimes glitched out and you can see through walls (whoa) In combat, the game shows exactly what your opponents will do, even when it's not their turn yet. Even though it does make things simpler, I think it just ruins the difficulty. (Oh, the boss is using his ultimate move after this? Let's Cancel it!)To conclude, even with the minor technical quirks and aging game engine, I give Grandia II Anniversary Edition a nostalgic and epic 5/5! Truly a masterpiece of a JRPG! To the fan of the series and also JRPG fans, I can assure you that the money spent is well worth it! I would also recommend to use Leandro Eidi's HD Mod where it adds a few nice little HD touch to the apparently aging game.;Recommended;40.4;28/03/2016;44;3

GungHo Online Entertainment;Ragnarok Online 2;Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 00,00;I have been playing this game for since it was released on Steam.Seen everything this game has to offer with a max level character, level 85 (ML35.)[ATM] With the new content being released soon, there will be more adventure's and areas to explore. I am addicted to this game with nearly 30 characters scattered throughout various accounts and have experienced every single class available in the game. Seen the ups and downs of the game. I've decided to stick by this game for better or worse.Everyone that has reviewed this game in the past has experienced some unfortunate bugs that have been long since patched. If you haven't given this game a try and are going by the reviews, judge this game for yourself. This review might get a ton of thumbs down but whatever.________________________________________________________________Due to numerous people asking for me to go more in depth with this review, here we go.---HISTORY---2 years ago this game was released as Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second, a wonderful & more challenging time. Everything was kind of difficult to do and most of the time people rejected you because of not having a specific amount of health for raid dungeons. September 12, 2013, they released the Noel class. December 2013, (can't remember the specific date like the previous one) this game was renamed to Ragnarok Online 2: Advent of Valkyrie introducing Master Level. ***[Side Note, master level is pretty much rebirth on RO1 but ONLY your display level is reset back to 1 (51).]*** With master level, the older content became easy to do. Until the ramped up the difficultly on the raid dungeons, still soloable if you have the right gears and junk. That same year, the korean server closed.October 2014, the SEA server merged with us making the game iRO2 (International Ragnarok Online 2) and a sperate server called "Freyja."July 28, 2015, the TW server merging with Freyja.---UPDATE---The last major update was the remake of Forgotten Payon and boosting the level cap to 85 (ML35). In August they will be releasing Jawaii, the honeymoon place from RO1. Awhile back they said that a marriage system would not be added with Jawaii but according to the "Will you marry me?" event on the forums, it might be added. (Ovvvvvver jooooooyed)---GAMEPLAY---***People have complained that it just a clone of WoW. I have not played nor will ever play WoW so I do not know about that. There are folks on the forums here on steam saying that the camera and movement is terrible. Everyone will exerience different things according to their machines and their connection to the server.***The basic levels, 1-50 are so easy to fly through combat level and professional levels alike. There are EXP events every weekend and sometimes during the weekdays to help players with grinding. Level 51-85 aka ML1-ML35, is just grinding of course you can do the Morroc and Dayr Desert quests to boost for MP this could be the main questline or all of the Daily Quests. This is where the EXP events mentioned before comes into play making grinding so much less painful. The current end game gears is Eddga, the "powerful" gear which was specifically designed for PvP. Most of my friends and myself, have stuck with the previous end game gears Cazar & Himmelmez. Now for the what you can do after reaching the max level, anything that you want to do. PvP in WoE (Guild vs Guild, located in Prontera & Morroc), helping low leveled players, collecting items, taking part in Trivia for prizes, farming for items, gears or pets and so on.If this is not in depth enough for you, just say so. With so much experience in this game I just picked key points and just touched on specific topics. I apologize if this is unorganized, this is my thought process.;Recommended;757.5;3/06/2015;285;19
GungHo Online Entertainment;Ragnarok Online 2;Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 00,00;I've never experienced another MMO with this many bugs. First, in order to log in with  Steam there is a separate launcher from the game. This only works half the time and there is no way to manually log in. After every update it stops working or sometimes it just stops working for no apparent reason. Second, quests are bugged. I've had a main storyline quest just break with no way to recover it and no other quests available, effectively making the entire character useless. Google revealed that there are several quests in particular that have been broken for years without anyone working on them. Third, the prices for items are different depending if you are on the Warp Portal website or if you're on Steam. The best deals are on their site. Also, some items expire after a couple of days (which is bad if you can't log in half of the time.)The game has been doctored so that Warp Portal can make more money. In the original Korean servers, there are quite a few Tiger mounts that you could purchase for in game money. All of these have been removed and put in a cash shop were you have a CHANCE at getting them permamently in a box. (There is only one mount available that does not require real money.) Costumes are not permament either. Most costumes expire after 30 days and you need to buy extenders to keep it. Both these items cost real money. If you want a permament costume the only way to get it is by more chance items, or by getting a lot of rare stones to play a pyramid game (which has an extrememly low chance of getting an item.) Inventory / Bank space is severely limited. Only 'medium' bags are dropped / purchasable which hardly have any slots. You will get these at level 10. If you want actual space, you need to buy bags from the cash shop. RO2 may not be a 'pay to win' but it sure is a 'pay to do anything fun' sort of game. Server population is pretty low. No one seems to be socializing. In fact, all the social interaction I had was a creepy guy hitting on me. So, if you play MMOs in hopes of finding some new buddies to talk too, you won't find them here. If you insist on plaything this game, do not do it through Steam. Go to the site itself, or better yet find another company / private server. Warp portal is not doing a good job integrating RO2 with Steam. If the game actually worked as intended I might suggest it for someone looking for a casual game to play with friends (if you don't mind old school rpg grinding) but since Warp portal provides such a terrible service, I suggest trying one of Aeria Games' anime MMOs instead. They have a cash shop too, but they are more fair about what they give you. Overall RO2 is a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT and I am not saying this because it is different from the first game. I am saying this because of the bugs, Warp portal's poor choice of business model and all the issues I've been having. I've played a ton of f2p mmos and none have quite been this bad. You have been warned!;Not Recommended;43.7;8/10/2014;162;9
GungHo Online Entertainment;Ragnarok Online 2;Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 00,00;Ragnarok Online 2: The Extremely Generic MMO Experience.I remember the good old days of Ragnarok Online, with its cartoony top-down anime art style, cool spell/skill animations, and overall fun appeal. So naturally, when I heard there was to be a sequel, a 3D sequel at that, I was ecstatic.-Insert several years of waiting here-Then came the day when I heard Ragnarok Online 2 was available for play. I was stoked. What followed was roughly 45 hours of the most generic game I've ever played and refused to finish. Where do I even start? I can safely say that I've played my fair share of MMO games, reaching into experiencing roughly 30+ different games. In the ones where I could make a character specific (Such as Mage, Warrior, etc), I would choose to make the healer. The most sought after, rarely played, and hardest to solo of them all. I also had a few other friends who were playing RO2 alongside myself. Well, over the internet of course. The whole time we were playing, it just felt like a tedious run here, do this, run back kind of game. At first, I wanted to give RO2 the benefit of the doubt, but after hitting the 2 hour mark, I could see, and sadly admit to myself, that this game was just not that fun, even with other people! During solo play, I found myself just mashing the 1 key to do my basic "Holy Light" attack, or whatever the skill was called. I barely gained another useful attacking skill for practically the entire time I played. Playing with the group however was a more enjoyable experience. At least then, I was able to use my Heal, Revive, and Buff skill.One of the cool things this game did have was the Card System. Almost every monster in the game would drop a card. These cards could be equipped. up to five. Certain sets would give you bonuses, and it gave the game a somewhat Pokemon-esque feel.While the quests were generic, there was always a plentiful amount. Story, Side, Dungeon, Monster Hunters, and more. You never needed to worry about needing something to do.Something Ragnarok Online 2 does that I absolutely LOATHE is having items, equipment, and mounts that had time-limits. Yep, you read correctly. Time-limits. The worst possible feature a game can have. Oh, and the class change in this game is nowhere near as awesome as the first game. You finish the quest and the person just says: Congrats, you're now a X, whereas in the first one, you had a light beam down on you and your clothes would change.Eventually I just got to a point where I said "I'm done." RO2 eventually becomes more of a chore than a game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Quests: As basic as they can get. Split into the trio of: Go Kill X, Talk To X, Gather X.Character Customization: Limited. Pretty much just Hair, Face, and Eyes.Graphics: While it's a nice touch to have Ragnarok venture into the 3D world, it lacks the detail of the original. From character models to environments to monsters, everything is very, VERY, bland and lackluster. One thing I will give RO2 is that it is quite colorful.Gameplay: Auto-Attack or Mash 1st Skill in HotBar.Monsters: RO2 definitely took the easy way out with its creatures, having many of the same monster models with varying color schemes.Sound: Nothing really stands out as bad, yet nothing stands out as great.Fun Factor: 4/10----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bright and Colorful settings, A unique card system, and some interesting boss fights just aren't enough to save this overly generic, bland MMO.~3 out of 10~;Not Recommended;45.1;26/11/2013;355;1

GungHo Online Entertainment;Ragnarok Online 2;Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 00,00;Stay away from this game.  It had a lot of potential when it first arrived here on Steam despite early showings of a pay2win model.  Unfortunately, despite all of our hopes, the game did indeed decide to milk us for all we're worth.  The classes were extrememly unablanced the last time I played and other than my own guild, the community was possibly one of the worst I had ever had the misfortune to play with.I wouldn't touch this game again if they paid me.;Not Recommended;64.8;26/11/2013;257;3
GungHo Online Entertainment;Ragnarok Online 2;Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 00,00;This game brings shame to the original Ragnarok, which gave many of us MMORPGers our very first taste of what it is to play an MMORPG. Comparisons aside, Ragnarok Online 2 is still one bad game. Stay away from it.RO2 is ridden with a horrible pay2win system. bugs that never or take hell of a long time to get fixed. unbalanced classes. a ridiculous amount of grinding to earn enough money to catch up with those who can buy from the cash shop. and endgame content that is almost impossible to get through unless you use glitches. The staff regularly release new content and events but leave a lot of the game's problems to the side. If you check their Facebook page, people still complain about bugs and other problems with the game all the time.The community is also pretty toxic since there are a lot of immature players who are super competitive about the silliest things, including sitting space in town. The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was because I had an awesome guild and really good friends who still played, so I was able to do endgame dungeons with a decent party. But when a majority of them moved to other MMOs, there was nothing left to do but leave as well.Just... stay away.;Not Recommended;394.5;16/12/2013;158;N/I

GungHo Online Entertainment;Ragnarok Online 2;Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, RPG;R$ 00,00;I can't, in all honesty, recommend this game. Although the early game aspect is fun and exciting, that facade quickly slips. Despite easy and quick leveling in early game, late game content is still severely lacking, and heavily unbalanced. Constant gamebreaking bugs, pay-to-win events, poor server optimization, lag and latency issues, incredible graphical defects and compatibility issues with regional settings on your computer make the game nigh unplayable at times, especially after big patches. The Pay-to-win model breaks balance between free to play players and paying players, and the gap between them is offputting to say the least. The biggest problem I have with the game is the ridiculous amount of RNG uses in places where there shouldn't have to be random attribution. Random chances to get an item that once opened up, gives a random chance for an item, and combines with other items with a random chance to get a good item. So many recursive random chances that player advancement is purely luck based, rather than progression based on player activity is unbearable to say the least.There are many good things about the game, but honestly, it's hard to talk about them, when the first thing you think of after a long session of raiding dungeons or grinding was: that was pointless.;Not Recommended;1,244.6;15/12/2013;161;1

Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;If you like Left 4 Dead style co-op, that's good. This game has similarities. The melee is much cleaner than Left 4 Dead 2 and where this game shines. The ranged combat certainly works but the emphasis is placed on your ability to balance out the hard hitting ranged with the melee weapons that go wide (long sword) or go deep (spear or axe), combined with the unique skills and abilities of the characters make this game quite fun.The voicelines, level design, hidden items, and scaling difficulty are icing on the cake. Most of the combat content is included, but a few powerful careers are locked behind DLC. There are also some DLC maps locked up, but if your host has the maps, you can play them without issues.The loot variety is mostly a 'power level' just to scale to higher difficulty and has less impact than perhaps it could. Weapon styles do make a difference and high level gear does often have traits that increase their utility to the team or have interesting effects such as generating ammo for a headshot, potions partially healing your friends, or reducing stamina loss when blocking hits.Overall, a very fun game that has remained fun for a long time. Shines with players, but beware of the whiny brats that run ahead leaving everyone behind. These people will sprint forward for some reason, not enjoy the ride, then get ragey when they end up getting picked off, blaming everyone else but themselves in a co-operative, team-oriented game. Don't lone wolf, be a team player, especially if there are some new players along the way.

Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;A great game with a great future Honestly I played this game too much to not recommend it. The combat is great, the maps are fun and the community is really friendly (I had maybe two toxic people in my time playing). So am I recommending this game? Yes of course, this is the greatest bang for my buck in my steam library, but I don't know if you can stick with this game for long. If you find the combat to be fun and want to see everything there is in this game you can spend like 120 hours to do all things which I would recommend doing, if it's really fun you can play this game for well over a thousand hours (I'm still not finished with everything). If it doesn't click with you in the first few hours, just refund it. Still I think everyone should at least try it, if a first person diablo set in the Warhhamer Fantasy universe sounds appealing to you: this is your dream come true. If you're not sure about it I will say this: try it and when you're happy with it stay for a few months and then run! You don't want to be around for as long as I am. So now let's get into the actual review part.  Why am I still here? So to start I think it's important to know where my opinon of this game comes from, I remember when the first one came out, I was initially interested but didn't buy till I had already put around 500 hours into the second game, so I'm not a veteran of the series by any means. I played both games and overall I think the second is better. When I bought this game on launch I was actually still playing with two friends, it was supposed to be gap filler for when Monster Hunter Worrld came out, but then I liked this game much more and played it for the next few months and suddenly the game was celebrating it's first anniversary, I would say this was the best time to be a fan of Vermintide 2. Then Winds of Magic hit, I was among many of the early beta players. I won't say that I think the game got worse after this expansion, by any means right now it's the best it's ever been, but something changed and I will tell you what changed later: For now I will recommend this game again. Right now you probably get the most fun with it, since there are now 15 maps and not just the twelve of the main game.  The Game Vermintide 2 is first person hack and slash set in the Warhammer Fantasy Universe. Further it's set during the End Times, so as always in this lovely universe: everything is ♥♥♥♥, ohh and the world is ending, but not to worry Lohner has a plan. Lohner is an innkeeper in the small town of Übersreik (the birthplace of SIGMAR) and throughout the first game we somewhat save the city with his help: We are Victor Saltzpyre, Markus Kruber, Sienna Fuegonasus, Bardin Gorekson and the noisy elf. In the second game our band of heroes has left the small town of Übersreik (or better said has been captured) and made it's way towards the mountain fort of Helmgart. There the Skavenclan Fester has allied with the Rotblood Tribe of the norscan Chaosworshippers, it's now our objective to destroy their armies, leaders and equipment. And while we're at it: we also travel to the Castle of Drachenfels, where yet another Aids... uhm I mean Chaossorcerer is threatening the area. So as you can tell, this game has a story, which in my opinion is one of the many reasons this coop-game is superior to many of its competitors. Four out of the Five characters are exremely likeable, they're all well developed and have nice banter with each other. Fortune brought them together and it shows. Even though they insult each other a lot the contrary is true, they need each more than they know and it shows. I would recommend this game for the characters alone, but again there's also the actual gameplay.  The good The gameplay is incredible in this game, it's a fully fleshed out combat system with many miniscule details you will learn while playing. The skillceiling is near endless and you can always get better, if this appeals to you, I again recommend buying it. Starting out you will play one of five characters, while you play you gradually unlock careers for each character, in total you can unlock 15 careers. All of them are similiar yet on the higher difficulties they will work different depending on which task you have to fulfil in a given career. Each character has his/her own set of weapons, all the weapons are good, there is  no s tier, they are all viable. So again this is a lot you can do and on top of that there are different tier for each weapon, grey being the worst, then green, then blue, then orange and then red. You get weapons by completing a level and getting a loot box, if you collect items on the map which make the game harder you will get a better loot box at the  end and therefore better loot, problem being, this is very random. The weaves system is better (but we don't talk about that). The main core of the combat is pushing, blocking and dodging while slashing at hordes of enemies. The enemies are all varied, there are as of now: Skaven, Chaos and Beastmen. Each Faction has a unique miniboss which you will encounter (Skaven and Chaos have two I know). There are also specials which you should snipe because they're are really dangerous and then there are elite enemies for each faction: Blackrats with spears and shields for Skaven and Chaos Warriors and Marauder for the Rotbloods (we don't talk about Beastmen). Add to that five Boss maps, there you can beat the Rotblood tribeleaders, the greyseer of Clan Fester, the Warlord of the Skaven and a Chaossorcerer. These maps are normal maps with the same gameplay, however there end event is a boss fight, if you bring the right careers these can be really easy, if not they will be a fair challenge. Again if this sounds good to you, then buy the game, it's on sale very frequently and even the normal price is pretty fair.  The Bad So I'm not reluctant to recommend this game, I think it's good and everyone should try it, however: If you want to stay here for as long as me, you should go. This is not elitism, the developers of this game are just really bad at handling it and it hurts. New content is handled really poorly in this game, I've been saying it for a few months now: this game isn't dead, it's being starved. There are night maps in this game, but the only time you'll see them is around halloween, there are actually 16 free maps, but one you'll only see during the anniversary, I find this to be harmful to the game as a whole and not really something special to celebrate. The latest free content for this game were three new maps, they're are among the best maps in the whole series and they are my only hope that this game will become better. This also ties into dlc management, the biggest dlc (and the one which had a beta) was a disaster and it's incredible that this game is still alive, in other words this really shows how good the actual gameplay is. They don't do big dlc anymore, now you can buy cosmetics, which seems to work for them. I hope that in a few months I can come back here and delete these sentences, but as of today I will not. We might also get one new career this year but if we're being honest this is not enough content. Here's hope they add more maps and finally release the content they already have, if not I don't think this game is gonna last the three or five more years they are aiming for.  Edit 1  It's been two freaking days since I wrote this review and it's already outdated, I will now fullyrecommend this game for a few reasons: 1. They announced an update for june 23 2020, this will feature new weather effects, this makes the game more replayable. 2. The new career is coming on june 23rd, this is much sooner than anticipated and gives me hope, that we will actually get two careers this year.If you have any  more questions feel free to ask me here or as pm. Happy slaying everyone.;Recommended;1,684.2;11/06/2020;427;7

Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;The game is incredible. I've played it since before launch. It has unparalleled melee combat that is impactful and satisfying. There are a bunch of weapons and classes and all feel unique. The maps are fun and challenging. No two runs are ever the same even on the same map thanks to the AI director. Things can be going great one second and you've wiped the next, but only if you aren't paying attention. The skill ceiling is incredibly high and even with all my hours I am nowhere near as good as the best players. And that's fine, because you don't need to be a great player to enjoy the game. Another highlight is the voice acting. Top notch all around. Being that the game is relatively small, I also found a great core group of friends. The game is much better when played with friends. I cannot recommend this game enough. Buy it, slay rats, and have a good time.;Recommended;3,030.9;19/04/2021;220;4

Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;(old review, might be outated in some cases - be aware...)Is it good? -YESIs it good for everyone?-NO... - depends!Why?...well it's a good mixture of: - L4D game mechanics (4 players vs AI with those special enemies, swarming hordes, but no PVP)- Chivalry: Medieval Warfare melee combat style with charged attacks, parry and dodge- Kinda pure ranged combat is possible with mage class, limited ranged capabilities due to ammo with others (might change with good loot luck)Features atm:- Good graphics (GTX770, i5-4x4.2ghz, 16gig RAM here playing smoothly on high settings – and I know folks that run the game on a first gen i7-860 with a gtx460 on low but are able to play ok'ish)- Responsive and smooth game engine if the hosting player is in the same region and has a decent connection (play with friends!)- Nice and atmospheric maps so far- Random map events you need to deal with keeping the same map re playable (as there where only 3 later 4 maps in beta)- On the run adjustable difficulty (Grimoires to pick up or not - more loot but group debuffs)-Team play is key – all loot improving items are shared at the end of the round no matter who carries them home!Stuff to be aware before buying this game:- The game play features getting permanently swarmed, little room to breathe or mistakes, it's hard survival after all even on normal difficulty. this is not a game to chill out and snipe some AI's off on a cake walk... no no no it is not!- Playing the game public may be kinda frustrating due to some players still have no clue what to do at all, run off and get killed quickly so having friends playing the game is a big difference to difficulty and success in general. You should join/form a group/clan in the long run or just be fine with those random dudes in public games – it's not impossible to master higher difficulties in public games but it's less likely for sure in WH:Vermintide.- 1st person melee combat may not be liked by everyone - but I was surprised how many of my friends who disliked the combat in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare now enjoy this game as it is PvE not PvP. A big difference!- hard difficulty means HARD DIFFICULTY atm, epic and legendary loot tiers require high game difficulties to get any chance at all rolling them ... you need a team of capable FPS/Chivalry players to proceed to those nice and shiny loot things! (I hope it stays this way... good loot should always be a challenge to get not only a matter play time and pure grind)- "head bobbing" can't be turned off yet so ppl with motion/simulation sickness be aware of this (or avoid 2H-weapons to minimize the shaking effect)- No color blind mode yet- Just one master volume slider meaning loud music all the time or low game volume... I got used to it but meh- No dedi servers yet (but promised)- Once again: playing public games is not ideal as some ppl (as like in any game) may not care about team play that much or have (yet) no clue how to react to certain events - I recommend to play it with friends or to quickly make friends with good players along your runs to master that learning curve together! Individual player skill is one thing, to form a successful permanent team needs time but it's very rewarding.- The loot system is very very random atm. If you're unlucky you won't get a good item for your preferred class after days of game time.State of game development: -The game has still some flaws with stability that might need treatment by the user...for e.g.: GTX680/GTX770 users might need to down clock their GPU by 40mhz with nvidiainspector.exe to avoid crashes (common problem in a lot of games these days...)-The game does not feel finished and polished balance and hit box wise, but it's playable - good luck finding another good COOP vs AI game those days so it's ok for me :)- The game Devs seem to care and fix stuff kinda quickly - so that's promising for existing and future issues.To sum it up:This game is an awesome TEAM CHALLENGE!L4D and L4D2 PvE are a cake walk compared to this.Like it or not, you will first fail, then hopefully learn, group up, maybe give up (!) or succeed through higher tiers of swarming PvE COOP madness!Or you don't care about good loot, (get drunk) play it on easy with friends and have a good time for some hours - totally fine too .) ===*edit  2015-10-26th :Situation in public games has slightly improved since more and more ppl are kinda experienced and the Devs set the in game VoIP to “ON” by default so others can at least hear you talk to them.I'm still missing some tactical shout outs like in Killing Floor or Insurgency like “follow me!”, take cover here!” (best with 3D marker) etc. to improve basic and quick communication.The random special enemy spawns make any run on any difficulty very unpredictable as you might encounter a Rat Ogre plus a Scaven swarm plus 2-3 special enemies at once! I have to say I like this randomness because if you master that … that's just awesome!On the other hand this means any run “only” on hard difficulty with 4 experienced mates in Teamspeak can end in a disastrous wipe – you never know!However, this is quite rare on lower difficulties so plz don't nerf this too hard... it keeps the same map tense like any small village you enter in DayZ - like you never know what's waiting for you around the next corner. A possible adrenalin rush and that feeling on a successful comeback - not many games aside from close competitive league games may trigger this on me:)Some helpful links and tips for beginners to break that hard learning curve:- Tome and Grimoire locations: http://www.vermintidedb.com/missions.php- Tutorials on the official forums: http://forums.fatsharkgames.com/categories/tutorials- New player advice on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/3oujwq/new_player_advice_thread_odoom/If you start the game for the first time you should set your FOV to 90 (*read edit down below) and the “Player Outlines” to “always on” so you won't be hitting the dwarf and elf all the time like I did in the fist hours of game cause you may confuse them with Scavens … no offense .)Also I recommend to rebind “Target” from “T” to “F” or something as marking special enemies and equipment is very helpful and the T-key feels to be too far off as you should need it a lot. Also enable/bind push to talk for public games and you may increase the gamma by a good bid to see what's lurking in all those dark corners waiting to back stab you... Many thanks for your nice replies guys – have fun slaying those rats!=====> * update 2017 (well, better late the never...)Consider this when changing FOV - haven't tested it but sounds legit:"Schwartzy 18 Apr, 2016 @ 10:45pmThe FOV setting in this game is for vertical FOV instead of the more commonly used horizontal FOV. So a vertical FOV of 90 is like 120 horizontal. Strangely it doesn't cause any fish-eye effect even though in other games a setting of 120 FOV usually would cause some so it's hard to tell that something's off, except you'll notice the rats hitting you from very far away with their melee attacks (and vice versa) which certainly doesn't feel right.So the actual setting for a horizontal 90 FOV should be around 60. You can bump it to like 65 FOV to make it a little wider but the higher you go the more the melee attacks will appear out of range."===Please consider that this game might have changed in some ways since I've posted this very review back then balance and perfornance wise .);Recommended;96.5;23/10/2015;1,202;71
Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;So after 2,634 hours of hunting rats, carrying tomes and inhaling poisonous green gas, I have still not written a review. And it is somewhat too late. There is probably no readership anymore since even this game's successor is years old by now. Many players have retired and I have too. enduring problems with my wrist made me prefer turn-based strategy. Otherwise I would still be roaming the streets, cellars, and squares of Ubersreik, and the depths below.There is just no experience comparable to the thrill, the immersion, the horrors and the triumph of a Vermintide run. Especially in a good team. In my years of playing Vermintide I have met the best, friendliest and most competent players you could ever imagine. This game had - and I'd assume still has - a fantastically creative, cooperative and supportive community, and there is a good variety of mods improving the experience in many ways.I've been playing all kinds of video games, for about 25 years now, and I can say with absolute confidence that Vermintide is the single best of them.;Recommended;2,859.0;10/04/2021;161;9
Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;I should have written this much earlier, but I was too busy playing this game I guess. I'm currently 379 hours in and played 50+ hours during the last two weeks. I'm in the middle of my exams as a vet student...Although I never was really interested in the Warhammer universe, mostly because the games that it featured weren't really my cup of tea, this game really sparked a flame. The setting is fascinating, the in total hours long dialog between the characters really tells the story of these 5 heroes, the rats look awesome and the maps breathe a great atmosphere. The gameplay is a melee focussed version of Left 4 Dead and feels very satisfying, it's easy to learn and has so much depth that I'm still looking in awe at those guys that are running the maps on the highest difficulty, without any bots or friends and with the worst weapons you can get.  On the topic of weapons: there is a great variety in weapons to pick from and your play style is highly customizable through 3 weapon traits and 3 personal trinkets. Vermintide also has an unoffical modding community, which in my opinion really improves the game, so certainly check that out. When you have enough of the story line maps, you can play against endless waves of rats in the "Last Stand" game mode (something I really enjoy a lot). And then finally: yes this game is still getting updated quite often.While I love this game, there are things that I think could be better. Compared to L4D2, the two game modes offer less variety and might get boring quicker than you expected. I did check however and it looks like I only have 144 hours in L4D2 and for Vermintide... well you can see my time played up here, which started counting since april 2017. What keeps people playing (and I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing), is partually due to the grind for better loot.  The modding community has added lots of improvements, so I don't see why the devs couldn't have added these things themselves yet (however I must say they improved the AI recently).Summary:(+) Brings the Warhammer universe and the ratmen alive, great cosmetic design and dialog that supports the lore(+) satisfying combat and gameplay mechanics, easy to learn and extremely hard to master(+) Great variety in weapons and playstyles(+) The modding community ads great improvements (although it's not officially supported and you need to download them from outside of steam)(+) Last stand game mode is great to add some variety if you are bored of the story mode maps(+) Devs regularily update the game and add new content(-) Quite a few maps, but only two game modes(-) There is a great element of grind, if you don't like that kind of stuff. I personally enjoy it.(-) The mods are great, but some of the mods add stuff that the devs should have really added themselves already.(-) New content is through paid DLC's (although some are free).  I think they are quite fair in what they offer though and you can play the DLC content without owning it (by joining someone who does).;Recommended;629.6;26/06/2017;276;17
Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;Have you ever sat down and thought to yourself:"Boy, wouldn't it be great if there was something like Left 4 Dead only about x10 as difficult and set in the Warhammer universe"?Because that's basically what this is.;Recommended;31.8;4/06/2017;950;82
Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;At 525 hours, I finally feel competent to give a decent review of this game.First of all, you don't spend 525 hours playing something that sucks, so this is a thumbs UP review right off the bat.ParticularsSOLO PLAYYes, it's good as a solo game - but while you can have a lot of fun with it, you're seriously missing out on the core of the game's teamwork regarding the utility of other players and things that can be learned by sharing knowledge of gear, maps, tactics, playstyles, trinket combinations, buff uses, terrain quirks, and every other aspect of a game whose play area covers the equivalent of several square miles in several scenarios.  It's also fairly impossible to know how good (or bad) you really are until you have seen people better than you are carry a whole event by themselves, then rescue the rest of the party, then carry the scenario finale solo again, then politely tell you "gg"... or ruthlessly tear you up and down for your many, many deficiencies.Regarding Steam achievements, while you can complete every scenario in solo play (except finding the Trials of the Foolhardy. that simply requires four players to unlock), there's no such thing as getting even close to all of the achievements because several of them require events in different areas of the map to happen at the same time.MULTIPLAY COOPFirst of all, YES there is friendly fire - and it's not very friendly!  That said, it's not usually very bad, either.  New players will be infuriated by being hit in the back and spinning around to see what's behind them, only to be hit from the opposite direction by the rat your ally was aiming for.  Learning with friends and as a team will minimize this aspect of frustration, and is much better than PUG groups as a rule, but you can always meet some amazing players if you're willing to go out there and play in the open.  Privacy settings allow any player to do either, and open lobbies (for those who choose that setting) allow players to choose groups in the scenarios they desire to play.I've run the gamut of encounters with the community, from juvenile delinquents essentially performing a hit-and-run leet no-scope flameout because they are in it for the lulz (rare, in my encounters), to the adult, mature gamer who is willing to stick with you and take a couple of beatings just to carry the team through for new cata players.  It's a mixed bag, but usually it seems people just want to have fun.  Since there's no versus mode (other than getting drunk in the inn, and fistfighting for bruises - which is hilarious, since the characters curse at each other while doing it) there's very little rq or angst, other than someone abandoning a group.Coordinating a group to use various abilities and buffs is a big part of the game, since a healing focus character with appropriate trinkets (gear) can keep a whole party healed IF the rest of the party allows them to pick up healing packs and draughts - and a potion sharing character with a chance to not consume the potion can share it again (and again, and again...) if they have access.  Same with bombs.RANDOM/OTHERAs compared to L4D2 I find VT to have far superior melee options, which for me is the deciding factor in what makes the game better.  In many other regards, the specials, hordes, and Rat Ogre are all analogous to their counterparts and provide challenge based on their number, spawn and direction of approach, and of course, difficulty setting.Each character has a selection of weapons that are effective at range and up close, and each gear has between 0 (basic gear) and 3 (elite gear) traits that can be unlocked.  These include things like push without using stamina, projectiles split into two shots, and does more damage from behind, and there are a lot of good guides explaining the strengths and uses of good combinations.The only outstanding point regarding characters is that many noob players like the elf because she's basically artillery.  Word to the wise: learn a different starting character. you'll find more groups.  Anyone can learn the elf later because... well, she's basically artillery.Great job on this game, Fatshark - I look forward to VT2 in the future.;Recommended;598.3;31/08/2017;142;8

Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;Well what can I say? I've played over 1800 hours at this point and I'm still playing until Vermintide 2 is released.People compare this to left for dead and whilst it's it's similar it's so much more.It's the kind of game you could drop in and play casually with friends on the odd occasion and have a blast. It's also a game you can keep progressing at with ridiculously indepth mechanics that reward high level play.CONS :  The loot system is too random for my tastes and doesn't reward losing. So you can play the highest difficulty and lose a ton but someone who plays nightmare casually and wins a lot will end up a higher level. Level means nothing really.If you want to play with bots I suggest the QOL mod but they're still a bit derpy. If you're a good player you can happily carry the bots through the hardest difficulty on full book runs with a bit of baby sitting.PROS :Skill level is insane. You can progress from teamplay to playing the game solo as in without bots. The game mechanics are solid. The combat feels visceral and satisfying and rewards skill over "hold w and mash lmb" style play. There's a lot of nuance you won't pick up on until you practice yourself.Storywise it's done really well. There's no real "story" but the voicelines and banter between the characters really paints a picture and makes pertty much every run satisfying.It has a more mature community where a lot of people are willing to help you out with tips and guides. Avoid the steam forum for this game though as it's the same 10 idiots giving bad advice and trolling each other. Stick to r/vermintide.At launch the game was a bit of a train wreck from what I heard, I started playing a year after and I've been really impressed with it.The devs, fatshark are really cool and are tight with the community. Their DLC policy is top notch.If you play with someone who has the dlc you can play the map and get the weapon drops for free. If you want to host the maps yourself and get the completion banners and do DLC contracts you need to buy them. Really fair. They have skin dlc which is pretty much about supporting the devs and I've been more than happy to do that.So all in all I highly recommend this game for people looking for indepth game mechancis with skill based progression. You might want to hold off for V2 but since it's always cheap and on sale I can tell you from from playing the closed v2 beta myself, any skills you gain from playing this will be directly transferable.Buy game, kill rats, become a hero of Ubersreik!And yeah I'm going to use this to shill my twitch.tv/distance9 so come see me on vermintide 2 :);Recommended;1,900.8;13/02/2018;175;10
Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;Yes it's Left 4 Dead with Skaven instead of zombies.

Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;It's been said before, (by Arch Warhammer, I believe), that Vermintide is the only good thing to come out of the Warhammer Fantasy Battles "End Times" lore. I can agree with that.I went in to Vermintide as something of a doubter, thinking, "How much fun could killing rats be?". As it happens, the Skaven are fantastic foes and Vermintide, while fairly straight forward, is a very good game.The Pros:-Combat is Meaty and Intense.-The Dialogue, both from the Skaven and Heros, is masterful: both in writing and delivery.-Learning how to play is nuanced and based in rhythm and skill, as well as map familiarity.-The Skaven are both comical and monsterous, with a sort of Lovecraftian overtone, providing satisfaction in their destruction.-The Hero Characters have distinct personalities and secrets, with many of those stories being suggested instead of explained plainly. Their interplay and banter is superb, delivering both lore and hinting at unusual personality traits. Furthmore, they're believable, with temperment changes based on circumstances- the normally boastful elf can be forced to plead for aid if downed, the normally polite Sergeant can become short-tempered if injured, etc. For a horde game, the characters are nuanced in a fashion that Bioware struggles for these days.-The visuals are excellent in a sort of Gothic Horror-Gone-Renaissance fashion. While not the most high resolution in texture, you won't likely have time to notice and performance is relatively clean and fluid.-The audio is good with solid musical scores and sound effects: you really feel that shield smacking skaven skull.-As of this date, (4/25/17), the game is largely bug free. There are some, still, however.-New In-Game Lore Book is a handy way to learn Warhammer Fantasy Lore and gives additional incentive to play.-DLC is either free or allows non-owner players to join DLC owners, which doesn't lead to a map bottleneck. DLC owners will still exclusively have access to DLC Bounties, weapons, and starting DLC map games. -Special Vermin force the players to mix up tactics.Cons:-Certain map features can hinder player movement, like cobblestones and debris sticking up. At best, this is an irritation. at worst, it can get you killed.-Occasional crashes, (fairly rare)-Skaven transitioning terrain, (climbing up over ledges, and such), do not react to croud control which can royally screw your team over, should said rats attack immediately upon standing up-Weapon stats are far more complicated that shown in-game, forcing the player to either find other sources of information, (i.e., YouTube), or discover by trial-and-error-Gameplay is heavily team oriented and there are a remarkable amount of garbage players. I guess you can't blame the game for this, but it is still a reality of Vermintide. -Player numbers are not amazingly high, so some hours will have player shortages, (like Weekday early mornings), while other times will have high numbers, (Weekends).-Only 2 gameplay modes and new weapons are the only real incentive for playing, limiting gameplay longevity.-No real class systems to enrich the game. just weapon types.-Skaven physics can glitch out. -Not worth the full price IMHO.-In-game voice-over-IP could use additional options.Note, while I have a large list of Cons, they are large in quantity, not quality. Would I recommend Vermintide? Yes, but primarily when on sale. With only two game modes and loot being the primary incentive to keep playing, the game can grow stale faster than most. Still, it's a unique experience and what is there is extremely well crafted.;Recommended;71.0;25/04/2017;115;1

Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;A lot of discussions have been going on about Krater. While some players praise the fresh rpg setting and the challenging quests, others critisize the imbalanced powers of the monsters.Here is what I experienced:Pros:- easy to get started, self-explanatory game mechanics, well-made learning curve- a solid story about abusing power, elite leaders and supressing the masses, set in a post-nuclear Sweden, with a good sense of humour- long-time motivation for those who love challenges, as there are perfect builds to find, the limbo (a 45-level-dungeon) to raid etc.- Nice graphic style, clean and fitting sounds and soundtrackCons:- Disastrous balancing: Some enemies are way too weak, others will bring your team down in no time. It takes a lot of time to find a good build for the final battle - but it does not depend on your own skill, but more on puzzling together different boosters (that improve strength, defense, stamina etc)- Boring quests, standard rpg loot & collect tasks- The coop mode is only three levels - well, for a game that calls itself a coop game, it's sparse, to put it mildlyIn the first ten hours of playing, I was about to tell friends to try out the game, as it had this fresh setting and things went on pretty well, absolving quests and looting dungeons. But then I was stuck more often due to strong enemies, no money to buy upgrades, and misspent boosters. The final battle got pretty frustrating as I did not find a build good enough to beat the final boss. Also, until today, I never found a single player in the coop lounge to join a game.Concerning that, I would not recommend to buy this game until one is going for a challenging rpg.;Not Recommended;31.6;19/06/2014;189;1
Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;Krater is a game which can neither be wholly dismissed nor whole-heartedly embraced. The tactical team-based RTS/ARPG hybrid battle-system is exciting, innovative, and well-implemented, while various tweaks to the typical ARPG formula show the thoughtfulness of passionate game design.  The graphic design is consistent and thematically appropriate throughout. Sadly, Krater plays like a concept demo - a few hours of fun as you acclimate to the control scheme and unique design elements, followed by a steep drop-off in variety. The crafting system is essentially a grinding-incentiviser, and character progression is bizarrely limited in ways which are obviously designed to conjure up more grindplay. While the four classes do allow for some interesting combinations and teamwork, each class has only two skills. Although these skills can be tweaked in a variety of ways thanks to the unique augmentation system, the actual gameplay is largely unaffected by these tweaks and runs together in a wash of habitual button-mashing. In many ways Krater succeeds - the writing is quirky, the world interesting, and the graphics stimulating. Unfortunately at the core of it all is an exceedingly repetitious experience. If your love for grinding or your desire to explore outweigh your distaste for repetitive gameplay, there is a unique and rewarding experience to discover here. Otherwise, avoid investing yourself in Krater: its innovation is only skin deep.;Not Recommended;4.6;4/03/2015;76;1
Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;The first impression is that it's a Fallout-like (the original Fallout that is) RPG with an interesting world, and great atmosphere, but once you play for a while you realize the story is unimaginative and the quests are like they were copy-pasted from some MMO.

Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;Krater: Shadows over Solside is a Top-down, Action-RPG developed and published by fatshark – pushed out of the gate in late-Spring 2012. Its reception was largely mixed – due to bugs, unfinished content and a lack of any sort of co-op mode. But how does it hold up five years down the line?StoryThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Sweden after the ‘Untergang.’ You take control over a bunch of mercenaries looking to make their mark on this new world. Their misadventures take to us to Solside – which perilously hangs over the Krater – a seemingly endless abyss that draws those from all over to seek its riches and possibly their demise in the process.    GameplayKrater conspires to deliver a smooth and diverse gameplay experience using various Action-RPG mechanics as its base. What differentiates Krater is that you can control up to three mercenaries at once – providing the tools to micro-manage each member quickly and efficiently.At first, you start with only three mercenaries but you can recruit others at recruitment NPCs on your travels. Mercenaries can be lvl’d up and enhanced through implants, boosters, weapons and gadgets – which provide a host of different possibilities and interesting combinations to tinker and experiment with.  There are a total of four different classes – Bruiser, Regulator, Medikus & Slayer. Each class has a mutant variant which possess radically different models and skills. Mutant variants have to be recruited. There isn’t any way to transform your base class into its mutant variant or vice versa.  The game will propel you forward in the form of both primary and optional quests, slowly opening the large map up for exploration. There are many neat references through various dialogue and item descriptions that will hint at the world pre-apocalypse.CraftingCrafting in Krater does not sit passively in the background. Recipes – obtained from drops and various receptacles – will grant you the ability to create a host of weapons, implants, boosters and gadgets allowing you to negate much of the gold cost from buying items from NPCs outright. And gold can be scarce for much of the early to mid-game so crafting becomes invaluable. Graphics/EnvironmentThere are a large of number varying environments – which all conspire to immerse you in the post-apocalyptic setting – from bunkers, swamps, deserts, caves and more. There’s a lot here for the eye to see to keep things fresh.In-game graphical options are limited – offering a small range of customization. You will notice the occasional flickering texture here and there. It is noticeable but doesn’t occur often enough to cause an annoyance.Music/SoundKrater’s soundtrack is exceptional in its range in tonality to fit any given moment. You’ll often stop and just sit back to listen to its complexity and ambience. In addition to the sublime OST, you have crisp animation sounds and various spoken commentary given by each mercenary throughout your adventures. For example, if stationary for a period of time, that fact may be noted by a mercenary. There are many different scenarios that’ll prompt a host of comments. The cut scenes that divide chapters are also brilliantly voice acted. Co-OpThe online co-op portion was a later addition to the base game and comes in the form of three multi-lvl missions – which add new areas, bosses and a good way to get loot. It’s important to note, the standard campaign story cannot be played in co-op. While the added co-op missions themselves are fun. The net-code is quite buggy and crashes have been known to occur frequently. As of writing this, I strongly recommend playing the co-op missions only in solo-mode which can be done by hosting your own game. The reason for this is that there is a bug present that can reset your characters completely to their base configuration if the host of a co-op game crashes. The last boss in the co-op mission Electrified!, Electro Bert cannot be killed at this time, due to a crash that always occurs about a minute into the fight.DevelopmentKrater: Shadows over Solside was initially planned to be the first part of a three part saga. Because of its mixed reception, the two other parts were never completed. The end of the current game ends on a cliff-hanger and the story may never have a proper resolution.  AchievementsBecause of the crash that occurs in the Electrified! co-op mission, there is a single achievement that cannot be attained at this time. For those looking to accrue the other 40 achievements, you’re looking at around a playtime at the bare minimum of around 50-60 hours. ConclusionWe’ve just eclipsed Krater’s 5-year anniversary. Despite all of the updates and additions in that time-frame which have been few and far between throughout, what we have is a game that still garners very mixed sentiments from those that experience it. I feel that Krater: Shadows over Solside will be remembered as a game that could’ve been exceptional but fell short of the mark in the end.;Recommended;130.8;15/06/2012;73;1
Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;This is one of those "maybe" games but I'm erring to "Not Recommended" just so people are aware of the issues it has.Most obvious - it's clear they intended this game to be large or even multi-part story but that never happened so it doesn't feel like a completed thing as-is - that doesn't mean it's not fun at times, it just means it's not "all of a piece".I've had issues around alt-tab since Beta and they're STILL THERE even now.  Alt-tabbing will almost certainly leave the game in an immovable/hard-to-interact-with window - it may cause the game to just stop responding entirely - it's almost never a good idea to do it.Saving is limited - you always restart from the nearest quest hub - and I've lost progress after a hang/crash a few times - I've lost progress after exitting properly a few times too - add that to it's dislike of alt-tab and you have a recipe for frustration which has led to me stop playing more-than-once.Difficulty varies WILDLY - you'll spend a lot of time doing really easy stuff and then hit something REALLY hard - often just a random mob which is super-tough or whatever - it clearly needed more polishing.All of that is a real shame because I like the setting, music, voicework, concept, playstyle, itemisation - it had a tonne of potential and ever time I come back to it I enjoy it for a while before I hit yet another pothole/crash and quit again!tl.dr lovely idea about half polished/finished and just a bit too crashy to recommend as-is.;Not Recommended;7.0;9/12/2015;61;N/I

My perk was never fulfilled, and they barely had any support. There were multiple different tiers of backing, including one for 10,000$. This company is among the most dishonest in the business. The game had a ton of potential, and it was just abandoned, like they do with literally every other game they release.

Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;Krater is a game I really want to like, although it has some shortcomings. First, the postitives:+ post-apocalyptic, yet "fresh" setting (a krater in future Sweden)+ nice art style+ doesn't take itself too serious (also some nice pop-cultural references)+ very cool system to modify skills and chars (via boosts/implants)+ crafting system+ "meaty" crits and nice fx+ teleport to world map from everywhere+ good loot is scarce (a plus in my book)+ great name generatorNow the not-so-positives:- booooring dungeons (only a few tile sets and it gets repetitive fast), almost no interactive objects or surprises and only a few rare special bosses- much back-tracking if you want to explore the whole map- opponents are just static groups in regular intervals in the dungeons - not much tactic involved, more like button-smashing- chars aren't really unique (with the exception of the DLC chars), they are randomly assembled and you can hire them in many towns- chars have limited levels, which you can expand with money to a max of lvl 15 (which you can reach in maybe 2h per char), after that there is no char evolution other than gear/implantsThat being said, this game would have had huge potential. Better maps and more interesting battles would have helped much. It just feels too generic as is.Imo, the best thing would have been, if the game had had turn-based or rtwp-combat with a deeper skill system. I'm sure it would have been a  (indie) success with that.I'm giving this a thumbs-up, although the devs didn't realize the potential of the game. So far I have fun.

Fatshark;Hamilton's Great Adventure;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 32,99;After first few levels you have seen everything this game has to offer. Nothing really changes, the stages just get longer and more frustrating. The gameplay boils down to trial and error. Even one misstep will make reaching the goal impossible and you have to keep starting over until you memorize the path perfectly. Sometimes a failure isn't even your fault as enemies can break the path too, even if you tried to keep them at bay with the otherwise completely useless bird. (Local co-op, yeah right.)If this were just a calm, slow-paced puzzle game, I could have lived with that. But no, there are "timed" puzzles as well and they really irk my nerves. For example, there was this one stage in which you have to keep a snowball rolling so it will eventually reach a button which opens the gate to the exit. You have to keep opening gates and eliminating enemies from its path, but over half of the time you can't even see, where the snowball is going, no matter how you try to turn the camera. So besides learning the right path, you have to have almost pixel-perfect timing too.Utterly boring game with unlikable characters and a story that nobody cares for. I paid about 1€ for this and still I think I got ripped off. Not recommended for anyone.;Not Recommended;16.7;31/12/2013;82;6
Fatshark;Hamilton's Great Adventure;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 32,99;I'm not sure whether to call this a puzzle game or not. All you have to do is to get to the goal, hitting switches, dodging environmental hazards and the occasional "enemy". Once you found the correct path to take, you can finish a level without much trouble. Collecting coins is optional but to unlock more levels you'll need a certain amount.Dont bother with the DLC since all it does is add 3 additional levels which arent too interesting nor challenging and you'll be done with those in no time.I guess this is a good choice when you feel the need to take a break from other games that piss you off.On a side note: Whenever I start this game and the splash screen "Plays best on Alienware" shows up I just cant help myself and I have to laugh.;Recommended;11.1;29/11/2013;42;7
Fatshark;Hamilton's Great Adventure;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 32,99;This is a rather long review, so if you want a quick summary of why I recommend this title just skip to the Results section and read from there.Fatshark created a fantastic little puzzle game which puts you to the test. Hamilton’s Great Adventure pushes out levels that pose mysteries and threats around every turn. Story:Hamilton’s Great Adventure starts you off telling the stories of your great exploits to your granddaughter. You relive Hamilton’s glory days as you try to get the parts for a machine required for a purpose you will learn if you beat the campaign. You and your bird, Sasha, must complete puzzles from Brazil, Egypt, India, and the Secret Islands. As the game progress Hamilton gets further into his tale and new characters are introduced. The game includes hilarious dialogue, with an interesting story that keeps you guessing, and levels that keep posing new challenges. As you progress through the game you obtain answers to the mystery and you learn all about how the story began. Gameplay:Hamilton's Great Adventure is a puzzle solving game which knowing the answer is the key. Unlike some puzzle solving games where you can see the solution but be unable to complete the challenge because of a simple annoyance in clicking a button at exactly the right time. This game puts your mind to the test to solve puzzles by completing challenges by using the correct answer. It’s fun and rather simple, yet some puzzles are a little more difficult than others. The games graphics are not the best, but they are crisp and the story is pleasant. Sasha can be difficult to control and managing two characters is rather difficult if you are not on your toes. Menus:One of my major gripes is that the in game menu is annoying to navigate. They tried to make the menu look like a book, but this is not very useful as you don't actually know what information is on what page. Ultimately you may have to flip through the whole book if you are looking for a simple answer. Hints:The pink vials are used to power up Hamilton’s special abilities. You can play as Sasha at the start of the level before activating the timer, so if you want to you can gather lots of the pink vials before even technically starting a level. You can also scare off the flying blowfish that attack Sasha by using a taunt when they are about to hit Sasha (it causes them to blow up and float away).Result:Hamilton's Great Adventure doesn't pull you in keeping you on your toes from level to level. yet, the game offers fun puzzles which you can solve during your spare time. I would like it if they had checkpoints. I don't play too many puzzle game so maybe they all don't have any checkpoints during levels. If you like to solve puzzles and you're tired of traditional puzzle solving games that challenge a user based on luck or precise click timing then this is for you. Pros:+Simple gameplay without too many commands to learn+Smooth movements+Fun and rather complex puzzles+Fantastic difficulty curve, the puzzles get gradually more difficult rather than exponentially+Nice art style which makes the games simple graphics seem rather elegantCons:-Very difficult menu navigation-Not a very riveting story (though it’s a puzzle game so you're here for the puzzles not for the tale)-Can be infuriating when you have solved the first part of the puzzle, but have to keep resolving to get to the second part of the puzzle;Recommended;8.0;22/02/2014;22;N/I

I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. The game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. I love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…The sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. The truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.I’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.Every now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was.

Hello Games;No Man's Sky;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;EDIT, 6 Sept 2021: No Man's Sky is no longer 'mixed'! Congratulations!Original Review:Don't let that "mixed" up there under review scores fool you: this game has changed SO much from its disastrous launch back in 2016. When this launched it was, as one commentator put it, "wide as an ocean, but shallow as a puddle." But Hello Games did something remarkable: instead of devolving into pay-to-win bullsh*t like we have seen time and time again, they sat back down, got to work, and have spent nearly five years releasing free update after free update, transforming the game in such a way it makes the launch build look like an early access beta.Want to be an explorer and just find as many planets as possible? Go for it. Want to be a space pirate and just steal all the stuff you need instead? Go ahead. Want to stick to just a few planets and build a mega industrial complex that prints more money than 1920's Germany, then realise that you're way in over your head and need to build a money farm just to build your money farm? Have fun. And if any of this is too boring alone, toss down a portal and invite your friends to play. If you bought this back at launch and felt like it was boring or shallow, I say to you, give it another go. I did, and I can say wholeheartedly that I was not disappointed.Bravo, Hello Games.

For that, the team got my respect for their commendable attitude.

Hello Games;No Man's Sky;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;I was one of the many people who pre preordered this game at launch. I bought a second hand ps4 just to play this game, i was fully aboard the hype train. After 30 hours in game at launch..  I wasnt angry, just disappointed. But thats so much worse isnt it? I turned off that ps4 for the final time in august 2016 and never turned it on again. I ignored every update they released, assuming at its core the game was the same. My little gamer group decided to randomly give it a chance last week on steam, and oh boy is this game different. Imagine the hype you felt at this games announcement, imagine all the things hello games promised coming to fruition. Now imagine they added more stuff in... just because. No mans sky has quickly and vehemently become my new obsession, the gameplay is engaging, immersive, fun and full of "wow" moments. Its buttery smooth, so well optimised and cross play pretty much sets itself up.You play it for a bit, hit up the wiki for an answer to how to find a good ship, then you spend 4 hours deep diving into the lore, which is where i got fully hooked.  The lore is incredible. This is the game i always dreamed of, and i imagine the game sean and the team originally thought up in their caffeine fueled manic state. And, they are constantly updating it with major content additions. For free.No loot boxesNo dlcFree. For anyone asking "should i give NMS another chance?" The answer is hell yes, DO IT NOW. For anyone seeing this game for the first time, prepare for something very, very special.;Recommended;273.5;29/05/2021;2,225;22

Hello Games;The Last Campfire;Adventure, Indie;R$ 46,99;The Last Campfire is a lovely puzzle adventure that brings an inspiring story about hope. This story is lived by Ember, who in a very kind and compassionate way tries to help other characters in the game, called forlorns, to have again hope and a purpose to keep moving on.In addition to the heartwarming story, the game also features very cleverly designed and creative puzzles that will always bring a pleasant satisfaction for solving them. The art is wonderfully inviting, and the soundtrack is a treat to the ears. It has no missable achievements, and the collectibles, while not necessary for completion, add a lot to the game's narrative.I finished the game in about 8 hours and I'm glad I explored every bit of it, because it was definitely worth it.

Hello Games;The Last Campfire;Adventure, Indie;R$ 46,99;The Last Campfire is a visually gorgeous game about the quest for the meaning of life and what defines home.  It explores the need for hope in our lives and has a touch of melancholy when it dives into our human frailties.  It is very cute and colorful, but there is a dark side to it that may frighten children under the age of 8.The whole game has a relaxing feel to it.  There is no pressure other than what you put on yourself.  There is no violence, no fighting.  Just a lot of brain teasers and some delightful characters along the way.  Be prepared to be touched now and then by the dialogue as you can relate to how the forlorn feel.The story is about Ember who gets lost and has to travel through forest, marsh and caves to find his way back home.  On his quest, he meets fantastical creatures and spirit guides who are at each campfire.  It is from the spirit guides that he discovers about the forlorn…embers who had given up or who had lost their spark.  Ember carried the light of hope within him and his compassion and love for the forlorn really strikes the heart.Many of the forlorn are us when we are drowning in sorrow. when we lose hope and our confidence. when we feel abandoned or lonely. when we feel confused or discouraged. when we are full of doubt or regret. when we feel a failure and want to give up.  All of us need an Ember in our lives and some of us are an Ember to others.  We stir others up to try one more time and that is the story of friendship and community.  These are the topics that come out in the narrative of this game.  Very deep and sometimes sad because not all forlorn want help or to move on.The narration is by a woman with an English accent and she voices the emotion that each forlorn is feeling at the time.  When Ember touches a forlorn, a puzzle is started.  These puzzles are easy to medium level, with a few hard ones thrown in.  These include mirrors and blocks and require some strategy.  Graphics are crisp and colourful.  Each environment is crafted beautifully and the music compliments this.  It is never intrusive, but is enough to enhance what is going on.  Game play is simple.  You can use the arrow buttons (I used keyboard) or just click the ground in front of Ember and he runs to the spot.  His motion made me laugh because he always looked like he was drunk as he rolled side to side!  You also control lights deeper in the game and use WASD to rotate them.I struck no bugs in this game.  The small developer team did an excellent job here and delivered a very meaningful game.  Achievements are easily obtained by just completing each environment.  There are hidden boxes which hide messages and notes from The Wanderer who preceded Ember.  Not finding all of these won’t affect your achievements.Highly recommend.  9/10.   This Ember is now heading off to put a bonfire under someone’s backside!!  Keep shining your light of hope to others.Postscript:  At the end of the game, go back to the main menu and click on puzzles.  There were 5 puzzles that weren't in the game, so a little hidden bonus for us!;Recommended;13.5;17/05/2022;57;1
Hello Games;The Last Campfire;Adventure, Indie;R$ 46,99;The game surpassed my expectations with its charming and well-crafted design. The puzzles, while relatively straightforward, contribute to the smooth pacing of the game. Surprisingly, the world-building and narrative are fleshed out, despite the game's short length. The beautiful artwork, featuring vibrant colors and clean lines, evokes memories of my favorite game, Journey. Moreover, the narrator's presence adds a nostalgic touch, making me feel like a child being read to.While the puzzles provided a good challenge, I only needed to seek help once. I highly recommend this game, especially considering the additional enjoyable puzzles. It's a fantastic game that skillfully explores themes of hope, grief, death, and moving on, all wrapped up in a cute puzzle game with delightful music. The puzzles strike the perfect balance between being challenging and achievable, stealing a piece of my heart along the way.Beyond its stunning visuals and smooth gameplay, the game boasts an intuitive interface. The emotional depth of the dialogue and story caught me off guard, as it warmed my heart and showcased incredible empathy and depth. The captivating aesthetic offers a relaxing experience, accompanied by a mysterious story and a wonderful message. Although the puzzles are generally straightforward, the sense of accomplishment upon completing them remains satisfying.This polished game gem shines with remarkable storytelling, featuring a simple yet meaningful narrative filled with metaphors. Despite the initially pushy narration, it contributes to the fairytale-like experience. The excellent gameplay introduces fresh mechanics, and the puzzles strike a perfect balance of challenges. Overall, I highly recommend this game, especially considering its price. It's truly a worthwhile investment.And if you need a helpful walkthrough guide, I've created one specifically for this game.

Not much to say about it so i'll probably keep this extremely short.Gameplay is very simple – you run around solving puzzles. You get few huge areas to explore and a bunch of collectibles to find. Each area has sub-areas with its own puzzles, characters or quests. The story is told without words.The main focus here is obviously puzzles which are mostly different and require different approach. But none of them are too hard so don't worry, you won't get frustrated, you'll have fun.On top of that you're presented with a very nice heartwarming story and melancholic atmosphere so you want to progress further to unveil the whole story and see how it ends.It's also a very chill and relaxing game, there's no pressure, you can just sit back, relax and enjoy.Graphics are very cute and the game in general looks wonderful.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger 2 improves upon the first game by adding more vehicles and other ways of transportation. I don't know what to tell you about it really. If you played the first one this one is very similar. Yes, the different vehicles add more variety to the game, but it's still all about collecting stars, letters and other collectibles, while performing as many stunts as you can. Except this time, the whole game is set on a movie set. Even the graphics look the same, with just slightly more variation. Also, the game performs much, much better than the first one. The first one had some annoying frame drops, but JD2 runs at a solid 60FPS at all times. But this Joe occasionally has some frustrating levels with not enough checkpoints.In the end Joe Danger 2 still isn't very long if you don't like to collect stuff, but if you do you're in for a treat. It's a great game, just don't expect too much new stuff. However, if it's your first Joe you have nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the ride ![Rating: 77/100];Recommended;4.2;6/10/2013;45;2
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game is not bad. It feels like ExciteBike at times, and in good, good ways. The controls are good (keyboard at least) and the feel of controlling is pretty much right-on. The style, graphics, and general components of making a game come alive are all there.But there's one big no-go for me, which is the presentation. The concept is fine. A bit dull, but fine. However, there are insufferable cut scenes that are neither helpful nor entertaining, that cannot be skipped. These go on for far, far longer than they need to. This is a game about riding a vehicle, jumping or ducking, and trying to spin as much as possible before you hit the ground again. The story (really, not much going on in that department) is such a thin, forgettable thing, that there is no need for a single cutscene, let alone several.There are tips and tricks screens and bubbles throughout the game, but they are often shown at the tail-end of a cutscene when you are already either frustrated or have tuned out, and after several minutes of irrelevant blather, the useful information is displayed just long enough to recognize what's happening. But before you can read the part about playing the game that could end up helping you, it is gone. It's the Keyser Soze of a hint-screen.When I finally reach the gameplay, there is a fun, balanced, entertaining game underneath. But the shiny, overdone, obnoxious, and person-who-invited-themself-over-and-hasn't-figured-out-it's-time-to-go-home-already atmosphere of all the parts of this game that are not actually the playing of it, really, really sour me on it.I would heartily recommend this if you like the ExciteBike gameplay and don't mind making a sandwich while the cutscenes play. But instead of waiting for my game to let me play it, I'll probably just move on to something else.;Not Recommended;1.5;2/02/2014;66;7
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;I quite enjoyed this game. I've played the main for 100% completion in about 11 hours, having done all the challenges in the game. I really like the music they have in this game. While I'm personally not really a completionist at all, this game did get me motivated to collect all there is to collect.If you are really into speedrunning or score attack games, than this game offers you that and you'll probably really enjoy this game. It offers you ghosts from other people and your own best run to use a reference. I recommend using a joypad though, because keyboard controls just sems a bit too confusing (or at least, for me that was the case). You race through an obstacle couse with some challenges (like doing a whole combo for the full length of the level or collecting all the collectables in the level), you have a nitro to give yourself a speedboost and to some arial tricks with and you can do some simple stunts to fill you nitro meter up again. You can race in various vehicles: a minekart/buggy, motorcycle, mono-wheel and a jetpack, each with their own handling (althoug the 4 wheeled and 2 wheeled vehicles feel a bit similar in my oppinion).Don't get fooled by the multiplayer aspect of this game. They are probaly referring to the leaderboards. There is actually some form of multi-player gameplay, but it's just bad (and only local, not via LAN or the internet) and I strongly recommend ignoring it exists or is mentioned on the store page. Neither should you get fooled by the 'many characters' in the game: they are just skins (and some with some voiceovers) and the game does not always remember which one you used the last time. And sadly, the ghosts are not available in the skin you've played with: they are just orbs of magical stuff in various colors.There is also a level editor and it seems easy to use. I haven't really bothered with it too much, because it's not really my kind of thing. But for people into challenging games and wanting to create a challenge for other people to enjoy: this is it! One thing though: the dev's decided that it was a good idea to force the level editor tutorials down your throught in order to get 100% completion. A decision I frown upon...Nevertheless, I really enjoyed myself with this game. And I think a lot of other people can do to.;Recommended;11.8;11/12/2013;22;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Probably my favorite sidescrolling runner game. The stuntman setting is cute and funny, and it allows you to explore a bunch of different enviroments by going through various "movie sets". There's a good amount of variety in the missions you do. like the classic Trials style single track courses, to multi-track courses, there are even jetpack courses where instead of riding something, you fly a jetpack! The missions are challenging enough to not be too hard/easy, and there's always the bonus objectives if you want more. All in all, it's a really solid game that I believe stands out among the crowd of all the other runner games.Worth checking out?: YesLikeliness of being bundled: LowPrice you should pay?: ~$3;Recommended;1.5;2/01/2016;10;2

So if you're into that (and why would you be?) i guess this game is for you.  I would still recommend this even with its fundamental flaw, based solely on its charming aesthetics.  The name of the levels are punny if not satirical. and the different vehicles and collectibles keeps the gameplay interesting enough to keep you playing the game, at least until you don't have nearly enough stars to unlock the next level.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger 2 is the same basic concept as the previous game in the series.  Instead of only riding a dirt bike, now you can ride a quad, a snowmobile, a jet pack, and more.  The obstacles are very similar where you have to maneuver through each level avoiding bear traps, spikes, and other deadly obstacles while also trying to accomplish your level goals such as beating a time, doing tricks 100% of the level, or hitting specific targets.The game starts off real easy and progressively gets harder.  The game is an absolute blast and should be played by all.  This is what Excite Bike should have been and the developers have truly attained an astonishing level of fun with this game and the entire series.Don't miss this game if you haven't had the opportunity to play it.  Of course, it does come with a couple draw backs.  One is that some achievements are broken unless you know how to download a previous version of the game through Steam Console.  There are some good guides out there to help you go to the original DLC version before the update when the achievements worked.  Also, if you want to play multiplayer with multiple controllers this will not be an easy feat on a single computer.  You will need to download a 3rd party controller program to help allow more than one controller to play at once.However, now with Steam Remote Play this game is easily accessible for multiplayer purposes and it kind of gets rid of the issue that was detailed above.  Still though, regardless of these downfalls in the game, the overall gameplay, graphics, and fun factor of this game makes this a very highly recommended game.;Recommended;75.4;4/03/2020;7;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game makes me wish Steam had a neutral rating. It's not bad, but it's not really good either. The screen is often too cluttered with explosions and various other moving parts, making it easy to lose track of your stuntman. Check out the original game first. It's the better of the two.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Try as I might I can't seem to find the fun.I'm normally a fan of this style of game but Joe Danger 2 just seems to never quite get fun. I think its biggest problem is that its just too messy. Details are well and good but this game just plain has clutter. Then its just not presented in a way that's interesting or cohesive. Which compounds the problems of the convoluted rewards system that is never rewarding. And finally the gameplay itself isn't fun. Again, its messy. They avoided the "endless runner" approach since some levels require reversing or braking. But then there's boosting, tricks (which are required to be done throughout a level for certain rewards), tilting/flipping, as well as a priming duck/jump. Its just like one thing too many for the extremely short cluttered levels. I don't know what to say other than it just plain doesn't work. Even attempting to get all the goals on each level and go for the 100% doesn't provide an extra incentive. I just couldn't find any fun. Only played past the first few levels just to say I did and give it a fair chance to open up into something better. It never did. Easy one to skip.;Not Recommended;2.7;3/11/2017;5;N/I

Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;I purchased this game for my son. I  read some reviews and watched the gameplay videos and figured that the game would be appropriate for a 6 year old. While the game is more than satisfactory for my son it is also hours upon hours of fun for myself. I play a lot of FPS, flight sim, and TF2. Most of these games have excellent gameplay with great graphics  and serious story lines. This game was a fun and lighthearted change of pace. I have had fun playing maps over and over finishing level accomplisments and laughing at the cartoon daredevil crashes. The graphics are fantastic cartoon graphics, the controls are easy to learn and with a control that fits his hands my son easily plays this game accomplishing levels and stringing together combos of stunts. This game belongs in the library of anyone young or old that plays games because everyone wants to have some relaxing fun occasionally. The levels are chanllenging enough to be interesting without it being too hard for a child to play or too easy for an adult to enjoy. Excellent game.;Recommended;5.5;3/07/2014;124;5

Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game is a lot of fun. Think Excitebike, in terms of how it plays. Basically, you’re attempting to reach the finish line, while racking up as much points as you can, and completing as many objectives as you can. Because there’s three lanes on (almost) every track, there’s always an objective or two (or more) that you can’t get in one go, so there’s always an incentive to go back and replay the level. Perhaps I never sat down and studied the moves, but it does feel like you can just mash buttons and get a really good high score, so I don’t like that necessarily, but on the other hand, it is a good game to mess around with. The game includes a level editor that you can create your own tracks with, but I didn’t get to mess around with it too much. The one thing that I will say that’s negative about the game is that there’s a certain track that comes out of nowhere and is just down right infuriating. it took me hours and hours to beat. Still, I would recommend this game, and while I haven’t played the second game, there’s a bundle that includes Joe Danger 2 for very little extra.

Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game has it all.  It's got fun gameplay for both single player and multiplayer (couch co-op) and a whole lot of laughs.  You take on the role of Joe Danger who goes through crazy obstacle courses over close to a dozen different worlds with multiple levels in each world.  The amount of races is beyond what is expected of a game who doesn't rehash the maps and just to a mirror version of them.  These are unique maps on each level.Each level offers a variety of achievements that you can get such as doing tricks the whole time, hitting certain bulls eyes that are littered over the level, collecting coins, beating a specific time, and finding special stars, and more.  This not only gives you an obstacle course to overcome, but once you beat it and have learned the level, then you get to try and accomplish the sub goals of each level, which is fun.  Some of them, in order to get the pro-medals you must beat all the achievements/goals in one run which can be pretty difficult.The graphics are fun, very cartoony, and perfect for the type of game where you character will get beat up constantly from your failed attempts.  This is where you laugh out loud while racing as you see the end results of your failures.  The game is played in 2D, but the graphics are 3D and sometimes when you fail an attempt and get launched, you'll get launched into the world rather than on the 2D track you were following.There are different modes of game such as you being the bowling ball with you bike and trying to take down all the pins, racing, beating an obstacle course, or editing the level on the fly while racing in order to beat the level.  The editing levels are quite different, but are welcome, especially as you get to the end where it really shows you what you can do with the build up.In fact, it's a great way to get your appetite whet for making your own levels from scratch.  Joe Danger offers a huge amount of community levels, some of which are quite difficult and others fun.  Unfortunately, there are also a lot of horrible levels out there from people who uploaded a simple design just for the achievement.  I'm guilty of this too.The reason I have so many hours on this game is that it's incredibly hard at the latter levels.  There is so much happening in a single level that even when it is memorized, the physics of the game work well enough that simple bumps on the road can alter how you jump or drive, so it keeps you on your toes.  I finally just unlocked the last of the achievements and those last few levels were truly difficult and quite the challenge, but more the reason to love this game.Definitely pick this up if you get the chance, I've had so much fun playing this by myself, with my kids, and this simple Excite Bike type game is truly highly recommended, worth every penny.;Recommended;47.1;17/02/2020;12;N/I

At 120 fps the game is twice normal speed and although I am sure their are some crazy skilled players that can play at this speed for the rest of us mortals 60 fps lock is recommended)/;Recommended;14.2;12/06/2024;4;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger reminds me of the NES days of Excitebike, mixed with the modern Stuntman series.  It's a simple lighthearted game that follows Joe Danger through his stuntman career with levels slowly increasing in difficulty.  At its core it's a simple game: Drive through courses gaining score by doing tricks and completing objectives.  The game throws a lot of obstacles at you however, and it can be quite a challenge completing all of the objectives without crashing and while maintaining your score multiplier.The game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Excitebike or Stuntman, or just anyone who likes a challenge.;Recommended;11.6;24/02/2014;8;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Fantastic game and just as much fun as it was a decade ago when I completed it on iOS. In that version, reaching 100% displayed a "secret" email address to write to for celebrating being part of the "100% Club".

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger 2 improves upon the first game by adding more vehicles and other ways of transportation. I don't know what to tell you about it really. If you played the first one this one is very similar. Yes, the different vehicles add more variety to the game, but it's still all about collecting stars, letters and other collectibles, while performing as many stunts as you can. Except this time, the whole game is set on a movie set. Even the graphics look the same, with just slightly more variation. Also, the game performs much, much better than the first one. The first one had some annoying frame drops, but JD2 runs at a solid 60FPS at all times. But this Joe occasionally has some frustrating levels with not enough checkpoints.In the end Joe Danger 2 still isn't very long if you don't like to collect stuff, but if you do you're in for a treat. It's a great game, just don't expect too much new stuff. However, if it's your first Joe you have nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the ride ![Rating: 77/100];Recommended;4.2;6/10/2013;45;2
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game is not bad. It feels like ExciteBike at times, and in good, good ways. The controls are good (keyboard at least) and the feel of controlling is pretty much right-on. The style, graphics, and general components of making a game come alive are all there.But there's one big no-go for me, which is the presentation. The concept is fine. A bit dull, but fine. However, there are insufferable cut scenes that are neither helpful nor entertaining, that cannot be skipped. These go on for far, far longer than they need to. This is a game about riding a vehicle, jumping or ducking, and trying to spin as much as possible before you hit the ground again. The story (really, not much going on in that department) is such a thin, forgettable thing, that there is no need for a single cutscene, let alone several.There are tips and tricks screens and bubbles throughout the game, but they are often shown at the tail-end of a cutscene when you are already either frustrated or have tuned out, and after several minutes of irrelevant blather, the useful information is displayed just long enough to recognize what's happening. But before you can read the part about playing the game that could end up helping you, it is gone. It's the Keyser Soze of a hint-screen.When I finally reach the gameplay, there is a fun, balanced, entertaining game underneath. But the shiny, overdone, obnoxious, and person-who-invited-themself-over-and-hasn't-figured-out-it's-time-to-go-home-already atmosphere of all the parts of this game that are not actually the playing of it, really, really sour me on it.I would heartily recommend this if you like the ExciteBike gameplay and don't mind making a sandwich while the cutscenes play. But instead of waiting for my game to let me play it, I'll probably just move on to something else.;Not Recommended;1.5;2/02/2014;66;7
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;I quite enjoyed this game. I've played the main for 100% completion in about 11 hours, having done all the challenges in the game. I really like the music they have in this game. While I'm personally not really a completionist at all, this game did get me motivated to collect all there is to collect.If you are really into speedrunning or score attack games, than this game offers you that and you'll probably really enjoy this game. It offers you ghosts from other people and your own best run to use a reference. I recommend using a joypad though, because keyboard controls just sems a bit too confusing (or at least, for me that was the case). You race through an obstacle couse with some challenges (like doing a whole combo for the full length of the level or collecting all the collectables in the level), you have a nitro to give yourself a speedboost and to some arial tricks with and you can do some simple stunts to fill you nitro meter up again. You can race in various vehicles: a minekart/buggy, motorcycle, mono-wheel and a jetpack, each with their own handling (althoug the 4 wheeled and 2 wheeled vehicles feel a bit similar in my oppinion).Don't get fooled by the multiplayer aspect of this game. They are probaly referring to the leaderboards. There is actually some form of multi-player gameplay, but it's just bad (and only local, not via LAN or the internet) and I strongly recommend ignoring it exists or is mentioned on the store page. Neither should you get fooled by the 'many characters' in the game: they are just skins (and some with some voiceovers) and the game does not always remember which one you used the last time. And sadly, the ghosts are not available in the skin you've played with: they are just orbs of magical stuff in various colors.There is also a level editor and it seems easy to use. I haven't really bothered with it too much, because it's not really my kind of thing. But for people into challenging games and wanting to create a challenge for other people to enjoy: this is it! One thing though: the dev's decided that it was a good idea to force the level editor tutorials down your throught in order to get 100% completion. A decision I frown upon...Nevertheless, I really enjoyed myself with this game. And I think a lot of other people can do to.;Recommended;11.8;11/12/2013;22;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Probably my favorite sidescrolling runner game. The stuntman setting is cute and funny, and it allows you to explore a bunch of different enviroments by going through various "movie sets". There's a good amount of variety in the missions you do. like the classic Trials style single track courses, to multi-track courses, there are even jetpack courses where instead of riding something, you fly a jetpack! The missions are challenging enough to not be too hard/easy, and there's always the bonus objectives if you want more. All in all, it's a really solid game that I believe stands out among the crowd of all the other runner games.Worth checking out?: YesLikeliness of being bundled: LowPrice you should pay?: ~$3;Recommended;1.5;2/01/2016;10;2

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;it's a glorified runner with what amounts to a Quick Time Events-based gameplay.  So if you're into that (and why would you be?) i guess this game is for you.  I would still recommend this even with its fundamental flaw, based solely on its charming aesthetics.  The name of the levels are punny if not satirical. and the different vehicles and collectibles keeps the gameplay interesting enough to keep you playing the game, at least until you don't have nearly enough stars to unlock the next level.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger 2 is the same basic concept as the previous game in the series.  Instead of only riding a dirt bike, now you can ride a quad, a snowmobile, a jet pack, and more.  The obstacles are very similar where you have to maneuver through each level avoiding bear traps, spikes, and other deadly obstacles while also trying to accomplish your level goals such as beating a time, doing tricks 100% of the level, or hitting specific targets.The game starts off real easy and progressively gets harder.  The game is an absolute blast and should be played by all.  This is what Excite Bike should have been and the developers have truly attained an astonishing level of fun with this game and the entire series.Don't miss this game if you haven't had the opportunity to play it.  Of course, it does come with a couple draw backs.  One is that some achievements are broken unless you know how to download a previous version of the game through Steam Console.  There are some good guides out there to help you go to the original DLC version before the update when the achievements worked.  Also, if you want to play multiplayer with multiple controllers this will not be an easy feat on a single computer.  You will need to download a 3rd party controller program to help allow more than one controller to play at once.However, now with Steam Remote Play this game is easily accessible for multiplayer purposes and it kind of gets rid of the issue that was detailed above.  Still though, regardless of these downfalls in the game, the overall gameplay, graphics, and fun factor of this game makes this a very highly recommended game.;Recommended;75.4;4/03/2020;7;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game makes me wish Steam had a neutral rating. It's not bad, but it's not really good either.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Try as I might I can't seem to find the fun.I'm normally a fan of this style of game but Joe Danger 2 just seems to never quite get fun. I think its biggest problem is that its just too messy. Details are well and good but this game just plain has clutter. Then its just not presented in a way that's interesting or cohesive. Which compounds the problems of the convoluted rewards system that is never rewarding. And finally the gameplay itself isn't fun. Again, its messy. They avoided the "endless runner" approach since some levels require reversing or braking. But then there's boosting, tricks (which are required to be done throughout a level for certain rewards), tilting/flipping, as well as a priming duck/jump. Its just like one thing too many for the extremely short cluttered levels. I don't know what to say other than it just plain doesn't work. Even attempting to get all the goals on each level and go for the 100% doesn't provide an extra incentive. I just couldn't find any fun. Only played past the first few levels just to say I did and give it a fair chance to open up into something better. It never did. Easy one to skip.;Not Recommended;2.7;3/11/2017;5;N/I

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;Terraria's latest major update, Journey's End (1.4) Labor of Love (1.4.4) is here. And it's great! I'll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the game is essentially complete and is full of content (and thanks for all the feedback on my review! It's much appreciated).Intro:If I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.Building:When Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. So many creations made in this game are incredibly good.Difficulty:Overall, Terraria with a Classic (AKA Softcore) character and Classic (AKA Normal Mode) world is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you’ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert Mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master Mode, giving you more loot than Expert Mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could create a Mediumcore character (drop all items on death), Hardcore character (permadeath), or use a world seed such as For the worthy. There is also Journey Mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can’t go to Classic, Expert Mode, or Master Mode worlds). Personally, I think playing a Classic character in Expert Mode is the most fun way to play.Music:Terraria’s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.Connection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I’ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player(s) can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.Performance:Terraria runs very well. On my gaming PC, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my over a decade old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.There are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.Price:Terraria is very inexpensive. It’s one of the few games I’ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.Struggles:Terraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you’ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn’t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can’t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don’t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don’t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won’t get every item in the game, if that’s what you’re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it’s possible to get every item in the game, but it’s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it’ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it’s not fun to abuse these).Tips:* Organize and name chests ASAP* Place rope down a Hellevator* Coral Torches are waterproof and Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) are liquidproof, making them ideal for being placed on bridges and Hellevators* The Smart Cursor, toggled on or off using Left Ctrl by default, is extremely useful for digging straight tunnels, building structures such as bridges, removing large areas of walls, and other functions. However, don't forget to toggle it off when you're not using it since things can go out of control* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can infect the Jungle biome over time* Go fishing. It’s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 1 in 3 chance to not consume potion ingredients* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms* Use Warmth Potions while fighting cold/ice-themed enemies (Deerclops, Frost Moon, etc.)Conclusion:I've played this game for over a decade now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after well over a thousand hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.;Recommended;1,571.2;5/05/2020;2,96;64

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further. Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime. After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on. With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me. Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors. Sincerely,Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen;Recommended;1,821.6;21/12/2020;973;23

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;You feel an evil presence watching you... This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10;Recommended;891.4;28/05/2017;917;25
Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria: - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements- It has an incredible amount of content to it- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!- I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTINGCons? Hmm.- Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!- Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. Other thought: - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is.

The addition of new features is a pipe dream that will likely never come true.  Over a year ago the original devs were promising all sorts of things ("Both seamonsters AND weather are already on the drawing board. Expect them within a month or so!" - December 2013).  None of these things happened and were lies.The game has Three locations and that is it.  Islands, where you kill anyone on it.  Sea battles, where you just board a ship or shoot it.  Town islands, where you buy things and hire new pirates.  At the start the game is pretty fun until you realise this is literally all there is to the game, the mechanics do not develop, new things are not introduced.  You will do the same thing you did in hour 1 in hour 100 (Other than shoot cannons).  Cannon fights are ridiculous, you could spend tens of hours collecting a crew, training them, equipping them and yet in a single cannon fight many of them will die, making all your hard work pointless.There is no real plot.  No real characters.  The music is average.  The graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same.  The gameplay is basic (You order your entire crew with 1 click..you cannot individually select) and it does not develop.  Frankly, the Devs should be ashamed for cashing in on an idea and then abandoning it, breaking hundreds of promises they made and hiring some random guy to do little more than take the blame.  Don't buy the game, the developers don't deserve the money and it sends out the wrong message if you do so.Edit: After announcing they were making a new game and seeing the negative reception it got, they announced a "free redux edition" for the game a week later, in an attempt to win back fans.   This doesn't change my review.  The game is still currently poor, was released unfinished and it's taken the dev 6 months of silence before announcing anything.  A games review is a review of the game. not future promises.;Not Recommended;9.8;11/10/2014;1,772;28
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Lots of fun for a small indie game. Not fully completed, but the dev is back and releasing updates after 7 years away and I'm thrilled to see where it goes!;Recommended;13.9;30/01/2023;177;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.Anyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here: -Pirates -Roguelike -Customizeable crew and ship -Characters level up, have equipment and skills -Freeform explorationBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of "early access" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad: -Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best. -Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting ♥♥♥♥ off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship. -Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so) -Multiple crew with the "cleaning" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it. -Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger. -"Animals" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded. -Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please. -It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders. -Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely "rinse and repeat". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs. -Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example. -The sound effects get old real quick. "JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER." -The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying. -Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a "quest", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly. -Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295086852 -Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross "destroyed" tiles. -I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't "beat" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.Most of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game. don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly "difficult" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of "early access", but that's not the case.I'll update this review as things change.;Not Recommended;6.7;1/08/2014;933;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Most of these negetive reviews were from many months ago, but I feel like a lot of progress has been made in this game. I for one find it very fun. + I really enjoy how you get to build your own pirate ship out of parts you plunder or buy. It is very fun to do that and you can take pride in your ship, but also you can capture other ships you find and abandon your creation. + Another great aspect is how you get to hire your own crew. There are tons of randomly generated people on the islands to hire and it is basically like having a follower in an RPG game, but you control them at the same time. The exploration is pretty great and very enjoyable, through finding peaceful islands to ones swarming with hostile natives, or attacking enemy ships on the seas. You can find great loot almost always which is a good incentive to keep exploring, so you can upgrade your ship more.+  A cool aspect is food management, so you have to make sure you stop by some main islands every now and then to get food for your crew. It keeps things realistic and there are times where you can be in a pickle, having to get back fast for food in the beginning. Later on though you can be able to keep a large amount of food on ship so it isn't as much of a problem.+The areas are rated on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty, so you know where to explore and where to go if you want a challnge. A bigger challenge means bigger rewards, like getting better plunder from an enemy ship (or you could just capture it). However it would be difficult to defeat the enemy pirates and natives to get to that point anyway, so it is mostly just a good way to see how the difficulty progresses until you get to the final 4 (ranked 10).However, there are some negetives to this game, but nothing major stood out. - The controls and how to play weren't explained very well, but it isn't that hard to figure out and a quick google search every now and then in the beggining could fix my problems, like how to feed myself and my crew.- The combat is pretty weak. I personally don't mind it, but you just click on enemies and your people attack them. It can be a little boring combat wise from just having your crew do thigns on their own with no input by you, by you can control who they attack and if you want them to go somehwere during fights.- There isn't much depth to the game other than to explore and plunder to get a bigger and better ship and more crew. The journey to get there is fun, but once you get there and clear all the enemies, you probably have to start a new character to continue having a challenge.Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It is worth the $10 I'd say, but I would reccomend holding out for a sale or using one of those coupons. It is very fun to explore and battle and customizing your ship and crew is something I really enjoy.;Recommended;10.1;6/01/2015;205;8
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned in an uplayable state. -DO NOT BUY-. A game breaking bug exists whre the Captain (player character) will get stuck and unable to move, meaning no further progress into the game. This happens arounf level 9. The developers have been silent on this issue long enough to assume the game has been abandoned in its current state. -DO NOT BUY-;Not Recommended;39.3;11/12/2016;92;2
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Very unfortunate to recommend against purchasing this game. The developer put a lot of love and work into it, and even recommends and facilitates people downloading the game via torrent first before buying. He put forth a rather ambitious development schedule and stuck to it. People who are saying he abandoned the game are not STRICTLY correct.That said, there are just too many game breaking bugs. The game was not left in a working state, and you will not be able to play it from start to finish without needing to load a save to avoid a bug. Most catastrophic from the state I currently see the game is pathfinding issues, specifically when landing on certain islands - this results in your characters either becoming stuck motionless on land until they are told to board the ship - at which point they dive into the ocean - or your captain becomes permanently immobilized on land. This is a very, very - very common bug, and you should expect it if you purchase this game.While I certainly support a developers decision to move on, especially when they were clear about their  games' development timeline, and love that the developer encouraged people to download the game and try it before buying it - I simply cannot under any circumstances advocate leaving a game that people payed for in such a broken state.Sadly, I do not recommend you purchase this game.;Not Recommended;99.6;31/08/2016;69;N/I
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I'm surprised this isn't Early Access, as it feels incomplete as-is and suffers a few game-breaking bugs. Skills and items, like Ship Repair and Chicken Nests, are obviously not finished/implemented into the game. There are also a few odd design choices that affect the game balance. Certain buffs are able to be applied to all crew members and stack, therefore making the game an odd one where it gets exponentially easier as it goes on. The first island should not feel more difficult than the final boss(es), imo.Gameplay wise, it's surprisingly similar to FTL. The ship combat and map, at least, have a lot of the same feel. You hire crew (which you have to keep healthy, happy, and fed), and you sail around plundering. There are three location types in the game - islands, towns, and other ships. Within those three, there are a few different flavours (cannibals or hags on islands, big ships or little ships, towns wih differing supplies). With the exception of a few bounty hunter fetch quests, and an option at the beginning to toggle a plague (which I didn't), there are no other events or surprises in the game. It starts to feel remarkably similar after a while, but more content should be on the way. The goal is to beat up progressively tougher opponants for progressively better loot, until you fight the final four bosses (conveniently spread WAY OUT across the huge map). Defeat them, and you get a cute song and the ability to continue playing. I'd suggest watching the cute song on Youtube and buying FTL.About 14 hours to complete Campaign mode on Beginner settings. I'd say around 3 of those hours (at least) was spent sailing - ie browsing the web in Steam's overlay, and closer to 8 hours if you don't count restarting after bugs/crashes (e.g. reloading caused my first mate to become captain while my captain was still alive, neither could progress).All that said, it's not a BAD game. I enjoyed it, but have no desire to play it any longer as is. When it's done, it'll probably be a pretty fun open world pirate sim. It definately has charm and personality. Certainly it's not worth the price right now, in Oct 2014. Check it out in a year and see where it's at.;Not Recommended;14.7;11/10/2014;283;6
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;So normally I would write a more concise review analyzing a game, and looking at all the good parts of it but also all of it's faults. Pixel Piracy is this special case where I absolutely adore the concept it delivers and the gameplay, but the execution is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful I can't bring myself to play it anymore, I wanted to play it to the end and explore everything, have a massive powerful crew that would dominate the seven seas. Instead we're left with a game that, to put it simply, is badly made. It doesn't work, and yet it 'released' mere days ago. Anyway, here's a list of about everything wrong with this game that will ruin your experience. Some issues may not seem important but do realize that all of them create unfair situations where the player is not at fault and yet the game will end up punishing them anyway or worse, just straight up giving them a situation they cannot get out of because of the god awful AI. So, here's the list.-Crew members acknowledge orders for maybe 1 second before ignoring it and going back to doing something that will probably get them killed or worse-Categorizing Crew members doesn't help much because giving them orders is a waste of time when they continue to do whatever the hell they want anyway. This can lead to crew members with no combat experience or health running out against high level pirates for no good reason. The above point also means that no matter how many times you try to move the low level crew member away from combat, they'll still just run back in and get themselves killed.-Your designated cook refuses to cook because you gave him a secondary job role and he's decided that's more important than cooking food for the captain or any of your crew which leads to the unfair death of you or your crew for no good reason other than the fact your cook decided that patching up the tiny bit of damage the ship took is more important than keeping the crew alive. The same goes for the cook having other jobs like Fishing. The same also happens if they're using interactable furniture like a Card set or Set of Swords. Apparently getting that straight flush is more important than helping your captain not starve to death. The same issue can also occur just from having your ship docked at an island, I don't know why it just bloody does.-Crew members who refuse to eat even when he's starving to death and you do actually have supplies of food. This relates to the above problem, if they have any kind of job or they're interacting with something menial, they will refuse to eat even when they're low on health because of starvation. This leads to numerous deaths.-Having multiple people who use cannons and multiple cannons and yet all of the crew members will use the same single cannon which makes it completely redundant, also half of the time a person who can use cannons simply won't for no reason-Crewmembers in combat refusing to target the enemy you picked for more than a second before choosing their own choice, which most of the time is the enemy with the most health instead of focusing down the person you just spent the last 30 seconds wittling down.-Ultimate skills are trash, it's impossible to tell when they're actually being used and that's because most of the time they're never being used, they're pointless and in 30 hours of playing I have only seen a crew member use one once, and it was useless-Selling cargo is useless and yields such a pathetic amount of gold. This is a game based around piracy, where people stole cargo from others to explot for themselves or sell for riches. In this however, you can steal hundreds of weapons, food and all sorts of other stuff and your reward for doing so is 1 gold per weapon no matter how powerful it is.Pixel Piracy is one of the most annoying games I have ever played. It doesn't listen. I don't think I've ever had to complain about a game not listening to me, where the AI is so brain dead that the simplest of concepts is beyond them, and it always ends up punishing you, for the developers misgivings. I can't recommend this game, please don't buy it in it's current state.

Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;I won't tell you if you'll like it or not. I'll tell you what you're getting so you can decide for yourself.Here's the major points most other reviews are missing:1. This is a sidescrolling RTS, not a platforming Terraria/Starbound clone.You do not modify your surroundings. There is no major recipe-based crafting. You don't WASD to move your hero. you drag a box around the group of units you want to control and right-click to perform move/attack/skill commands. This will not scratch that 2D sandbox-world itch.2. If you don't like the deck-building process of your favorite trading card game, you won't likely enjoy this game.You choose/enhance the characters you want, then their classes, then their tech tree bonuses, and then finally their gear and abilities before every "level." This is literally half the game, and it's akin to the deck-building portion of your typical TCG. You then pit this "deck" of characters against a random series of enemy-filled rooms and hopefully find pride in the outcome of your well thought out preparations. This inevitably results in a couple dozen more items (read: "new cards for your deck") with which you rinse and repeat endlessly. How this comparison is being missed until now is beyond me, but it's an incredibly important aspect to understand before you sink your teeth into this game.3. Your first couple hours can be hard to enjoy as your decisions/mistakes will not feel meaningful/consequential.You won't start off with much of anything to do beyond selecting all of your units, right-clicking bad guys, and waiting for everything to die. Fortunately, this isn't the case after your first hour or two. You'll also eventually realize the significance of your resources as soon as you run out of one for the first time (e.g., the currency for shopping, the currency for cloning items and reviving, the currency for your tech tree, or the fuel for exploring new levels). Much more importantly, however, you'll discover (on your own, after the tutorial) that the difficulty of each individual "level" can be scaled through the roof as you see fit. there's no need to bore yourself to death versus enemies that require no thought or effort to defeat. And before you ask, scaling the difficulty up does reward you with better loot drops accordingly, so it's a satisfying choice instead of an arbitrary, self-imposed challenge.4. The amount of content is appreciably greater than most "loot 'em ups."Each class feels uniquely important with a wide variety of sub-specialties to choose from within each class. The active and passive buffs and unlocks you'll have to pick from in the tech tree are mostly all interesting. The random item modifiers on your gear range from the typical +stats, resistances, and status immunities to auto-casting unique spells on weapon reload and ensuring a chance to drop consumables on kill. The art for each world feels rich and engrossing. The enemies you'll encounter are varied enough in behavior, ability, and art that you likely won't think to complain. The random NPCs and quest-givers you'll come across frequently have distinct personalities and charm. There's also a decently-lengthed story-focused quest line, procedurally generated side missions, unexpected random encounters, and your typical market fare (buying and selling from stores, shipyards, blackmarkets, etc).Update 1: The notable May 2017 patch added new content, bug fixes, more useful tooltips/labeling/hints, and relative UI scaling (i.e., no more unreadably small text).Update 2: The developer, Quadro Delta, went bankrupt on September 4, 2017.

Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;The game has some nuances, seemed a little short to me, and the difficulty was a little odd (the first big boss of the game nearly rekt me, yet I was able to face tank the final boss in the game barely taking any damage).  But otherwise, I had quite a bit of fun and safely recommend this game.Pros:+Sense of Humor+This is not Pixel Pirates in space.  Made by the same author(s), there are some small similarities..  but the game plays completely different.+A good selection of unit types, and multiple ways to set up your platoon+Tons of random loot+Space booze+Vanguard Mecha-Suits+Giant Bosses+I liked that every class seemed to have it's own niche, although there is some overlap.Cons:-Too much loot causing too much item management.  Others have mentioned it, and it's true.  I ended up cranking my auto-recycler up to the highest level, and still had plenty of loot to equip and sell.-NO AUTO ATTACK!  This game could desperately use it, as you're forced to micro every single enemy in every single fight, even if you choose to not use abilities and pick equipment with passive bonuses.-Kinda short.  I have 25 hours at the time of writing this, beat the game (as far as I know, don't wanna spoil anything), and did a lot of side fighting for the lulz along the way.  And I've played 2 play throughs, one hardcore that I lost, and one normal that beat it.-Control system and menus take some "learnin'".  The tutorial does a decent job explaining it, but lots to remember/figure out.-Can't kill the flying bunny-Can get repetitious.  Gameplay consists of doing missions on planets (that are always kill missions or item pickup missions) with occaisional random events in between.  It's not terrible and didn't bother me much, but the last 1/4 of my playthrough I found myself skipping missions as much as possible and wasting money on fuel, just to go for main objectives.Edited for typos and a couple things I forgot to add;Recommended;27.2;5/06/2017;281;10

Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;A great concept, rough around the edges.    I am writing this as a family man with very limited time to sit down and immerse myself in games. As such my leanings lately (2015 - 2017) are games that follow this criteria (This is not exhaustive but I hope I can convey the gist)1. Inexpensive but with good value. pricing is subjective, but some games need the base game plus 4+ extra DLC in order to 'enjoy proper', I avoid this more often than not.2. Playable for minutes or hours but feels like I'm making progress no matter what. Open World games usually suceed at this, MMORPGS however not so much. When I can play in long bursts, Its because I'm enjoying the game not because I need to in order to, Save or progress. Interesting aside, I love Soulsborn because progress happens everytime you play, even if it is minute. 3.  Ability to Pause for long periods while I chase my toddler down, cook, run an errand etc4. Production Value, Mobile games and free to play usually lack this. there are exceptions like Warframe. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The above mentioned list demonstrates my situation fairly clearly I hope, I need a game that I can play within my hectic life, a game with quality that doesn't demand 4 hours at a time minimum in order to feel like that game session was worth it. Pixel Privateers fits this bill for me perfectly. It's playable in 8 hour bursts of for a quick 20 minute mission. So for my lifestyle and if you are in a similar situation to me, it's a candidate for Daddy's 45 minute breathing time until Saul, Underwood and Bojack come back... -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As a game does it hold up??I love the idea. It's a little bit of a few genres I am endeared wtih. I love the ability to name my squaddies. My kids love hearing the stories of their little pixels saving the group or wiping out the bad guys with that new flamethrower. The gameplay is fine, but I find that larger squads require a bit micro management that I am simply not good at. There is a quality of life issue I have. My squad won't attack unless I order them to. I've had situations where I'm in a fight and my squad fights the boss, once the boss dies or explodes into a horde, I have to manually target the lesser enemies, which are small that feels like an extra step that isn't fun. The larger engagements are usually fine, but my squad not defending itself because I can't find the enemy or I'm looking up from my screen for real life issues. It's nothing major but is apparent.The style and presentation are good, Tongue in cheek full of references and I must say, almost obligatory nowadays. There is also alot of downtime between missions as you consider resources, fuel and weapon loadouts. I love it, each mission yields a surplus of items that you can sell for credits, which are used for ship upgrades, having more control on the loot you have via being abe to purchase from the shop or buying more squaddies. The other options are like the Kanai cube/Hordordic cube from Diablo to reroll 4 item types, rarity for different items or rarities and finally broken down into matter, which is used for teleporting your squad to missions and reviving the little buggers should you die on normal mode. All in all, this game is fun, engaging and with its own flaws (That could be patched out easily.... please turn on auto fire!) Thank you for your time in reading this;Recommended;9.4;26/02/2017;55;1
Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;Pixel Privateers is in no way a bad game, however there are issues with the gameplay and mechanics that let it down as a whole.Disclaimer: I do not hate this game, I actually quite like it, however I feel that 87% is too high for what this game offers so I'm writing a review explaining my opinion.Pros:+ART: Some of the pixel artwork is pretty lovely, the bases and planets are well detailed and beautiful+WORLD: The world and concept is nice, it stays pretty consistant with races and characters. There are cyborgs in this galaxy that have spread out over countless worlds, as well as a race of bio-monsters that want to turn all genetics into their fleshy masses of DNA, and you're trying to get technology from these worlds for The Company. It gets a bit more advanced later on, but stays at the 'passable' stages and never quite overtakes a lush and consistent sci-fi world like say FTL+LOOT: There is plenty of Borderlands-esque loot. I also like that what look you equip determines their class. Every character has 4 slots and you can spend ages just fitting out your guys after a couple missions of loot.+TECH TREES: I like the researching mechanic in the game, despite its simplicity. You just pick up items and they gain research points over time which you can spend on identifying rares or upgrading a crew-wide research tree.Cons:-BUGS: Could not use an elevator and had to force quit the game. Melee units would not attack certain enemies. Units would sometimes walk back and forth in the middle of combat and doing nothing. Hold position button does nothing. Right clicking to attack enemies as they beam into your ship causes all your units to move to it. Can cheese losing situations by quitting the game and everybody gets max halth again. Game breaking framerate at some boss levels. Sold all my inventory, went back to crew tab and it was still there. That's just a handful of the ones I remember right now.-SIMPLICITY: At the start, when you have 2-3 guys, combat requires thought, and pausing it with the spacebar. However, late game is just a grind of taking your 8 man squad of level 26 guys with guns, selecting them all, and right clicking every enemy in order until they're all dead. This plays into my next point...-NO AUTO ATTACK!?: Yours guys do not auto attack. This is a huge, huge problem and reduces incentive for using strategic attacks, and encourages just using your entire squad to attack one enemy. Say there's a group of three enemies. if they kill the first one, if you do nothing they just won't attack. they would all die before attacking by themself. This seems to also include turrets and drones. This can be fixed, I'm sure, but it's a massive gaping problem that encourages zerg rushing, and unfortunately the game is still very possible using that strategy. Another problem with this is there is LITERALLY A HOLD-POSITION BUTTON that says "Will attack enemies in range" and it just doesn't! They still suffer from the same auto-attack issue.-VARIETY: There are plenty of enemy types in this game, don't get me wrong. But, as a whole, there seems to be 3 races: Two robots and a zerg-equivalent. The problem with this is that, using the zerg rush tactic explained above, they all have the same tactic to kill them, select everyone, right click, zerg rush, win. Very rarely do you need to, for example, move your guys out of enemy fire, get on either side of an enemy to flank, use abilities to stun or put in stasis.... Coz you just right click them all to death. To put it into perspective, I used exactly the same tactic on the bosses, including final boss. right click it to death and occasionally right click a spawned minion. The healers heal automatically so I don't need to do anything.-SHIP INVASIONS: When you're travelling around on the map, random events can occur, normally being attacked by an enemy ship. This is, without a doubt, the worst (purposely programmed) part of the game. You just walk around your ship, wait for enemies to teleport into the room, and kill them. There's no 'defense' part about it whatsoever, it's just a boring time waster that gives barely any reward. The devs must know this because there's a perk at the start AND a research tree item to lower the chance of it happening.-STORY: The 'story' itself is pretty generic. however my issue is that it drags on for so long. There is absolutely no reason this game needs to go for 12-18 hours. You'll enjoy your first 6 for sure, but the lack of variety in the late game leads to tedium and total boredom. Even the regular missions become a total chore (which you need to do a certain amount of to unlock more missions) of just blasting through 90% of a map. And, I'll put it here. two of the boss stages featured game-breaking framerate issues (The second robot boss and the first zerg boss) where my game slowed down to 10 fps. This is a pixel game. I have no idea why this happens but for lower end computers I can imagine those levels would be a total pain.-PIXEL PIRATES: You've probably realized by now that this game is developed by the same people who made Pixel pirates. Whilst not a bad game in itself, that game lacked a real driving force to grind through its countless bugs and far-too-long campaign. Privateers is better, by a long way (At least I only discovered a handful of bugs with this and not a thousand game breaking ones), it benefits from a more direct approach. However, the late stages feel like a chore with collecting 5 Macguffins, and then in true No Man's Sky fashion, the game just ends and starts you again with a different map but the same characters. If you have never played Pixel Pirates and you like the idea, you will definitely enjoy this game more than Pirates, but understand these games are not perfect. It's a meal-priced RPG strategy-lite.CONCLUSION:If you came to this game looking for an exploration game, you should try Starbound.If you came to this game looking for a space roguelike, you should try FTL.If you came to this game looking for a strategy game, try.... I dunno, Battle Brothers is pretty good lol.And if you came because "It's by the Terraria guys!" no, it's just published by them. If you are really digging for a good strategy-building space game, then you should 100% definitely try Rimworld instead.6/10: Game is functional but lacks a lot of stuff that makes a strategy-roguelike engaging for longer periods of time.;Not Recommended;18.0;25/02/2017;142;N/I

Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;A fun loot-gathering game with a ton of options regarding party-comp and character customization. Two characters of the same class need not be the same stat/skill wise, and there are a ton of weapons to choose from (there are no class/weapon restrictions). As an example, my medic uses hammers and gets bonus heals for every attack he does. He beats enemies in the face and heals while he does so.Gameplay is interesting, albeit a bit uninvolved in the early game. Planets tend to be varied and there are a few different objectives that you may receive upon landing. Gameplay consists of the loop of: Prepare party -> go to planet and get loot -> go to galaxy map -> prepare party -> repeatIt's simple, but it's addicting and the varied loot keeps me coming back for more. I recommend it if you're into games like Diablo, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, etc.My biggest gripe, aside from a lack of truly varied objectives, is that controlling five characters is tedious, thus leading me to leave most of them on auto while I control my tank and engineer.  I would like to see more viability for having fewer than five characters in a party (three would be my sweet spot between interesting gameplay/party comp and reasonable micro-management). The game does allow you to pause mid-combat to issue orders, which helps with this. think Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity.Overall, the game is quite fun and offers a really addicting loot-loop that I think will be enticing to many players.;Recommended;7.5;21/02/2017;31;2
Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;70/100, not worth $15 yet.The game has potential, but seriously tapers off after a dozen hours.Wait for later patches, see my suggestions. The game feels unfinished despite 1 major 5-part quest chain. ======== Pros/Cons ========+ Great artwork+ Loot-a-holic drops, 8 tiers (grey, dark green, light green, blue, purp, red, orange, and teal)+ Nice skilltree, multi tiers, upgrading both characters and your ship.+ Great rooms system on ships, has more potential later on.+ Love having multiple units, each class has 3 play style options based on their class relic.+ Ability to add difficulty to missions for better chance at loot drops.+ There's a few rerferences to other games, which is a trip.    (Apparently there's a cube recipe for a cow level? I would love to see a wiki for unique recipes)= Music is alright. Not blown away, but not hating it either. Chill, sorta ambient at times. = Matter / Fuel become almost useless over time with high-tier Research Point upgrade.= There's a nice number of planets to check out, but see my notes on level scaling. However, there are a ton of small things that just snowball into a poor experience.These will effect your gameplay, I guarantee it. - Major memory leaks / fps drops: I'm running a moderate+ system (i5 with a 1070 GPU)  I'll drop from 150 frames down to 20 over the course of one map. That needs to be addressed. - No Auto Attack + Hold Commands don't work: I would make more use of tactical pauses, but it's just better to set a 2x4 basic team formation (Vanguard tanks up front, Marines 2nd, Healers 3rd, and Scout/Eng in the back) and just focus fire on one monster at a time. Your units will just sit there and eat damage if you don't do something about it. Keep a finger on Q, you'll be babysitting that key.- Automatic level scaling: I love leveling to zone, and the bosses should reflect that progression as a milemarker.Nothing feels better than grinding hard, swooping solid gear then smashing a boss into next week. (It should be a 15-25-35-45-55, Final 65+ kinda deal.) This way, If I want a hard battle, I can throw on the modifiers. Instead, Give yourself 15+ mins (not kidding) to chip away at each boss and micromanage their timed minion summons. Bosses aren't a challenge as much as they are obnoxius. Every planet auto scales to you, so there's no benefit or need to travel far out to find the right zone.  The level scaling seriously kills the sense of progression in this game. - "Company Quests" are just cheap low-tier item / fuel / matter grabs. Take your pick of the three: Save prisoners, research rooms, collect random drops. Rinse. Repeat.- They need to change the color on their final item tier. Top tier items blend in a little too easily. Try black/red/silver striped boxes or somethin' different. - Multiplayer is a nice feature, but it needs a ton of work. I had some luck with playing LAN, but I have heard horror stories for those not playing locally. - Endgame after the warp: I watched my brother play past the final boss, but... there's... nothing.  No endgame quest trigger, no special company quests, no unique planets. Did we miss something?  Why include it if there is nothing but a replay of the same game under the guise of an "alternative universe?"Edit: I made it to the "alternative universe" to see it for myself.... uhhh. Wut. ======= Final Verdict ========70/100The games an alright time sink for now, and with some much needed fixes, it could be worth 15+ bucks.They have a great idea, and some great mechanics already in place.Problem is it's lacking some basic features and endgame content. It still has gameplay killing bugs.Either wait for it to go for less than $6-7 on a sale, or wait until 1.0.2 or much later is released.This game was... finished, but not really, you know?======== Dev Suggestions ========- Fix Auto Attack / Hold Commands- Chef Zakarian made a great point about the game having an RTS feel, but not having a intelligent/behavior autoattack system. I linked his review below:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041699470/recommended/342640/- Remove Level Scaling. It's killing your game.- Address Memory Leaks + FPS Drop. - Please add a convenient to access loot filter. Once you hit 10k Matter, you're really  just looking for Purple's or higher to do cube rolling. Things to add?- Add more quest variants: "Timed" Explore/Kill, Multiplanet Escort Missions, Maybe a "clear infection/wipe out mutiple hives" Maybe a "Distress Beacon, check out this ship" quest. Hell, I would love a "Help fix a warp gate" quest to help create waypoints for far exploring. - Endgame: Perhaps Legendary Class Relic quests, Maybe a rare merchant quest leading to a get upgradeable ship rooms, making matter/fuel useful again.  Introduce Minor/Major sockets add-ons allowing us to tweak with Purple or lesser items. - Play with random encounters: Let me decide to pick up those hitcherhikers that always become Punks invading my ship. Currently they are more of a headache then "oh wow, this could be neat". - Add "warp gates" that we can reach from the outposts, or allow us to save warp locations. - Add "home base" near the first wormhole, where we can store items, maybe have NPCs chill?- Play with your cube crafting system, it's an awesome little thing to gamble/reroll, but you could do some end game customization with it. A recipe tracker tab on the box would be nice.- Trading in multiplayer, it would be nice to have an item/resource economy to encourage dedicated MP. As a side rant, I have put the game down twice trying to get to the 5th boss because I have to fly about 400+ fuels distance (no, I'm not kidding) Why are 4 major bosses within 30 fuel of eachother and this one is so far out?Those interruptions are now the sole the bane of my existence in your game.I wrote this review rather than deal with the trip to the 5th boss.;Not Recommended;23.3;27/02/2017;19;N/I

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned by the original Devs and they've hired another guy to basically do little more than bug fix.  The addition of new features is a pipe dream that will likely never come true.  Over a year ago the original devs were promising all sorts of things ("Both seamonsters AND weather are already on the drawing board. Expect them within a month or so!" - December 2013).  None of these things happened and were lies.The game has Three locations and that is it.  Islands, where you kill anyone on it.  Sea battles, where you just board a ship or shoot it.  Town islands, where you buy things and hire new pirates.  At the start the game is pretty fun until you realise this is literally all there is to the game, the mechanics do not develop, new things are not introduced.  You will do the same thing you did in hour 1 in hour 100 (Other than shoot cannons).  Cannon fights are ridiculous, you could spend tens of hours collecting a crew, training them, equipping them and yet in a single cannon fight many of them will die, making all your hard work pointless.There is no real plot.  No real characters.  The music is average.  The graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same.  The gameplay is basic (You order your entire crew with 1 click..you cannot individually select) and it does not develop.  Frankly, the Devs should be ashamed for cashing in on an idea and then abandoning it, breaking hundreds of promises they made and hiring some random guy to do little more than take the blame.  Don't buy the game, the developers don't deserve the money and it sends out the wrong message if you do so.Edit: After announcing they were making a new game and seeing the negative reception it got, they announced a "free redux edition" for the game a week later, in an attempt to win back fans.

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Lots of fun for a small indie game. Not fully completed, but the dev is back and releasing updates after 7 years away and I'm thrilled to see where it goes!;Recommended;13.9;30/01/2023;177;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.Anyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here: -Pirates -Roguelike -Customizeable crew and ship -Characters level up, have equipment and skills -Freeform explorationBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of "early access" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad: -Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best. -Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting ♥♥♥♥ off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship. -Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so) -Multiple crew with the "cleaning" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it. -Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger. -"Animals" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded. -Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please. -It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders. -Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely "rinse and repeat". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs. -Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example. -The sound effects get old real quick. "JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER." -The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying. -Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a "quest", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly. -Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295086852 -Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross "destroyed" tiles. -I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't "beat" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.Most of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game. don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly "difficult" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of "early access", but that's not the case.I'll update this review as things change.;Not Recommended;6.7;1/08/2014;933;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Most of these negetive reviews were from many months ago, but I feel like a lot of progress has been made in this game. I for one find it very fun. + I really enjoy how you get to build your own pirate ship out of parts you plunder or buy. It is very fun to do that and you can take pride in your ship, but also you can capture other ships you find and abandon your creation. + Another great aspect is how you get to hire your own crew. There are tons of randomly generated people on the islands to hire and it is basically like having a follower in an RPG game, but you control them at the same time. The exploration is pretty great and very enjoyable, through finding peaceful islands to ones swarming with hostile natives, or attacking enemy ships on the seas. You can find great loot almost always which is a good incentive to keep exploring, so you can upgrade your ship more.+  A cool aspect is food management, so you have to make sure you stop by some main islands every now and then to get food for your crew. It keeps things realistic and there are times where you can be in a pickle, having to get back fast for food in the beginning. Later on though you can be able to keep a large amount of food on ship so it isn't as much of a problem.+The areas are rated on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty, so you know where to explore and where to go if you want a challnge. A bigger challenge means bigger rewards, like getting better plunder from an enemy ship (or you could just capture it). However it would be difficult to defeat the enemy pirates and natives to get to that point anyway, so it is mostly just a good way to see how the difficulty progresses until you get to the final 4 (ranked 10).However, there are some negetives to this game, but nothing major stood out. - The controls and how to play weren't explained very well, but it isn't that hard to figure out and a quick google search every now and then in the beggining could fix my problems, like how to feed myself and my crew.- The combat is pretty weak. I personally don't mind it, but you just click on enemies and your people attack them. It can be a little boring combat wise from just having your crew do thigns on their own with no input by you, by you can control who they attack and if you want them to go somehwere during fights.- There isn't much depth to the game other than to explore and plunder to get a bigger and better ship and more crew. The journey to get there is fun, but once you get there and clear all the enemies, you probably have to start a new character to continue having a challenge.Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It is worth the $10 I'd say, but I would reccomend holding out for a sale or using one of those coupons. It is very fun to explore and battle and customizing your ship and crew is something I really enjoy.;Recommended;10.1;6/01/2015;205;8

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Very unfortunate to recommend against purchasing this game. The developer put a lot of love and work into it, and even recommends and facilitates people downloading the game via torrent first before buying. He put forth a rather ambitious development schedule and stuck to it. People who are saying he abandoned the game are not STRICTLY correct.That said, there are just too many game breaking bugs. The game was not left in a working state, and you will not be able to play it from start to finish without needing to load a save to avoid a bug. Most catastrophic from the state I currently see the game is pathfinding issues, specifically when landing on certain islands - this results in your characters either becoming stuck motionless on land until they are told to board the ship - at which point they dive into the ocean - or your captain becomes permanently immobilized on land. This is a very, very - very common bug, and you should expect it if you purchase this game.While I certainly support a developers decision to move on, especially when they were clear about their  games' development timeline, and love that the developer encouraged people to download the game and try it before buying it - I simply cannot under any circumstances advocate leaving a game that people payed for in such a broken state.Sadly, I do not recommend you purchase this game.;Not Recommended;99.6;31/08/2016;69;N/I
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I'm surprised this isn't Early Access, as it feels incomplete as-is and suffers a few game-breaking bugs. Skills and items, like Ship Repair and Chicken Nests, are obviously not finished/implemented into the game. There are also a few odd design choices that affect the game balance. Certain buffs are able to be applied to all crew members and stack, therefore making the game an odd one where it gets exponentially easier as it goes on. The first island should not feel more difficult than the final boss(es), imo.Gameplay wise, it's surprisingly similar to FTL. The ship combat and map, at least, have a lot of the same feel. You hire crew (which you have to keep healthy, happy, and fed), and you sail around plundering. There are three location types in the game - islands, towns, and other ships. Within those three, there are a few different flavours (cannibals or hags on islands, big ships or little ships, towns wih differing supplies). With the exception of a few bounty hunter fetch quests, and an option at the beginning to toggle a plague (which I didn't), there are no other events or surprises in the game. It starts to feel remarkably similar after a while, but more content should be on the way. The goal is to beat up progressively tougher opponants for progressively better loot, until you fight the final four bosses (conveniently spread WAY OUT across the huge map). Defeat them, and you get a cute song and the ability to continue playing. I'd suggest watching the cute song on Youtube and buying FTL.About 14 hours to complete Campaign mode on Beginner settings. I'd say around 3 of those hours (at least) was spent sailing - ie browsing the web in Steam's overlay, and closer to 8 hours if you don't count restarting after bugs/crashes (e.g. reloading caused my first mate to become captain while my captain was still alive, neither could progress).All that said, it's not a BAD game. I enjoyed it, but have no desire to play it any longer as is. When it's done, it'll probably be a pretty fun open world pirate sim. It definately has charm and personality. Certainly it's not worth the price right now, in Oct 2014. Check it out in a year and see where it's at.;Not Recommended;14.7;11/10/2014;283;6
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;So normally I would write a more concise review analyzing a game, and looking at all the good parts of it but also all of it's faults. Pixel Piracy is this special case where I absolutely adore the concept it delivers and the gameplay, but the execution is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful I can't bring myself to play it anymore, I wanted to play it to the end and explore everything, have a massive powerful crew that would dominate the seven seas. Instead we're left with a game that, to put it simply, is badly made. It doesn't work, and yet it 'released' mere days ago. Anyway, here's a list of about everything wrong with this game that will ruin your experience. Some issues may not seem important but do realize that all of them create unfair situations where the player is not at fault and yet the game will end up punishing them anyway or worse, just straight up giving them a situation they cannot get out of because of the god awful AI. So, here's the list.-Crew members acknowledge orders for maybe 1 second before ignoring it and going back to doing something that will probably get them killed or worse-Categorizing Crew members doesn't help much because giving them orders is a waste of time when they continue to do whatever the hell they want anyway. This can lead to crew members with no combat experience or health running out against high level pirates for no good reason. The above point also means that no matter how many times you try to move the low level crew member away from combat, they'll still just run back in and get themselves killed.-Your designated cook refuses to cook because you gave him a secondary job role and he's decided that's more important than cooking food for the captain or any of your crew which leads to the unfair death of you or your crew for no good reason other than the fact your cook decided that patching up the tiny bit of damage the ship took is more important than keeping the crew alive. The same goes for the cook having other jobs like Fishing. The same also happens if they're using interactable furniture like a Card set or Set of Swords. Apparently getting that straight flush is more important than helping your captain not starve to death. The same issue can also occur just from having your ship docked at an island, I don't know why it just bloody does.-Crew members who refuse to eat even when he's starving to death and you do actually have supplies of food. This relates to the above problem, if they have any kind of job or they're interacting with something menial, they will refuse to eat even when they're low on health because of starvation. This leads to numerous deaths.-Having multiple people who use cannons and multiple cannons and yet all of the crew members will use the same single cannon which makes it completely redundant, also half of the time a person who can use cannons simply won't for no reason-Crewmembers in combat refusing to target the enemy you picked for more than a second before choosing their own choice, which most of the time is the enemy with the most health instead of focusing down the person you just spent the last 30 seconds wittling down.-Ultimate skills are trash, it's impossible to tell when they're actually being used and that's because most of the time they're never being used, they're pointless and in 30 hours of playing I have only seen a crew member use one once, and it was useless-Selling cargo is useless and yields such a pathetic amount of gold. This is a game based around piracy, where people stole cargo from others to explot for themselves or sell for riches. In this however, you can steal hundreds of weapons, food and all sorts of other stuff and your reward for doing so is 1 gold per weapon no matter how powerful it is.Pixel Piracy is one of the most annoying games I have ever played. It doesn't listen. I don't think I've ever had to complain about a game not listening to me, where the AI is so brain dead that the simplest of concepts is beyond them, and it always ends up punishing you, for the developers misgivings. I can't recommend this game, please don't buy it in it's current state.

This doesn't change my review.  The game is still currently poor, was released unfinished and it's taken the dev 6 months of silence before announcing anything.  A games review is a review of the game. not future promises.;Not Recommended;9.8;11/10/2014;1,772;28
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Lots of fun for a small indie game. Not fully completed, but the dev is back and releasing updates after 7 years away and I'm thrilled to see where it goes!;Recommended;13.9;30/01/2023;177;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.Anyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here: -Pirates -Roguelike -Customizeable crew and ship -Characters level up, have equipment and skills -Freeform explorationBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of "early access" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad: -Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best. -Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting ♥♥♥♥ off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship. -Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so) -Multiple crew with the "cleaning" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it. -Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger. -"Animals" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded. -Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please. -It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders. -Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely "rinse and repeat". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs. -Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example. -The sound effects get old real quick. "JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER." -The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying. -Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a "quest", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly. -Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295086852 -Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross "destroyed" tiles. -I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't "beat" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.Most of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game. don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly "difficult" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of "early access", but that's not the case.I'll update this review as things change.;Not Recommended;6.7;1/08/2014;933;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Most of these negetive reviews were from many months ago, but I feel like a lot of progress has been made in this game. I for one find it very fun. + I really enjoy how you get to build your own pirate ship out of parts you plunder or buy. It is very fun to do that and you can take pride in your ship, but also you can capture other ships you find and abandon your creation. + Another great aspect is how you get to hire your own crew. There are tons of randomly generated people on the islands to hire and it is basically like having a follower in an RPG game, but you control them at the same time. The exploration is pretty great and very enjoyable, through finding peaceful islands to ones swarming with hostile natives, or attacking enemy ships on the seas. You can find great loot almost always which is a good incentive to keep exploring, so you can upgrade your ship more.+  A cool aspect is food management, so you have to make sure you stop by some main islands every now and then to get food for your crew. It keeps things realistic and there are times where you can be in a pickle, having to get back fast for food in the beginning. Later on though you can be able to keep a large amount of food on ship so it isn't as much of a problem.+The areas are rated on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty, so you know where to explore and where to go if you want a challnge. A bigger challenge means bigger rewards, like getting better plunder from an enemy ship (or you could just capture it). However it would be difficult to defeat the enemy pirates and natives to get to that point anyway, so it is mostly just a good way to see how the difficulty progresses until you get to the final 4 (ranked 10).However, there are some negetives to this game, but nothing major stood out. - The controls and how to play weren't explained very well, but it isn't that hard to figure out and a quick google search every now and then in the beggining could fix my problems, like how to feed myself and my crew.- The combat is pretty weak. I personally don't mind it, but you just click on enemies and your people attack them. It can be a little boring combat wise from just having your crew do thigns on their own with no input by you, by you can control who they attack and if you want them to go somehwere during fights.- There isn't much depth to the game other than to explore and plunder to get a bigger and better ship and more crew. The journey to get there is fun, but once you get there and clear all the enemies, you probably have to start a new character to continue having a challenge.Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It is worth the $10 I'd say, but I would reccomend holding out for a sale or using one of those coupons. It is very fun to explore and battle and customizing your ship and crew is something I really enjoy.;Recommended;10.1;6/01/2015;205;8
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned in an uplayable state. -DO NOT BUY-. A game breaking bug exists whre the Captain (player character) will get stuck and unable to move, meaning no further progress into the game. This happens arounf level 9. The developers have been silent on this issue long enough to assume the game has been abandoned in its current state. -DO NOT BUY-;Not Recommended;39.3;11/12/2016;92;2
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Very unfortunate to recommend against purchasing this game. The developer put a lot of love and work into it, and even recommends and facilitates people downloading the game via torrent first before buying. He put forth a rather ambitious development schedule and stuck to it. People who are saying he abandoned the game are not STRICTLY correct.That said, there are just too many game breaking bugs. The game was not left in a working state, and you will not be able to play it from start to finish without needing to load a save to avoid a bug. Most catastrophic from the state I currently see the game is pathfinding issues, specifically when landing on certain islands - this results in your characters either becoming stuck motionless on land until they are told to board the ship - at which point they dive into the ocean - or your captain becomes permanently immobilized on land. This is a very, very - very common bug, and you should expect it if you purchase this game.While I certainly support a developers decision to move on, especially when they were clear about their  games' development timeline, and love that the developer encouraged people to download the game and try it before buying it - I simply cannot under any circumstances advocate leaving a game that people payed for in such a broken state.Sadly, I do not recommend you purchase this game.;Not Recommended;99.6;31/08/2016;69;N/I
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I'm surprised this isn't Early Access, as it feels incomplete as-is and suffers a few game-breaking bugs. Skills and items, like Ship Repair and Chicken Nests, are obviously not finished/implemented into the game. There are also a few odd design choices that affect the game balance. Certain buffs are able to be applied to all crew members and stack, therefore making the game an odd one where it gets exponentially easier as it goes on. The first island should not feel more difficult than the final boss(es), imo.Gameplay wise, it's surprisingly similar to FTL. The ship combat and map, at least, have a lot of the same feel. You hire crew (which you have to keep healthy, happy, and fed), and you sail around plundering. There are three location types in the game - islands, towns, and other ships. Within those three, there are a few different flavours (cannibals or hags on islands, big ships or little ships, towns wih differing supplies). With the exception of a few bounty hunter fetch quests, and an option at the beginning to toggle a plague (which I didn't), there are no other events or surprises in the game. It starts to feel remarkably similar after a while, but more content should be on the way. The goal is to beat up progressively tougher opponants for progressively better loot, until you fight the final four bosses (conveniently spread WAY OUT across the huge map). Defeat them, and you get a cute song and the ability to continue playing. I'd suggest watching the cute song on Youtube and buying FTL.About 14 hours to complete Campaign mode on Beginner settings. I'd say around 3 of those hours (at least) was spent sailing - ie browsing the web in Steam's overlay, and closer to 8 hours if you don't count restarting after bugs/crashes (e.g. reloading caused my first mate to become captain while my captain was still alive, neither could progress).All that said, it's not a BAD game. I enjoyed it, but have no desire to play it any longer as is. When it's done, it'll probably be a pretty fun open world pirate sim. It definately has charm and personality. Certainly it's not worth the price right now, in Oct 2014. Check it out in a year and see where it's at.;Not Recommended;14.7;11/10/2014;283;6
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;So normally I would write a more concise review analyzing a game, and looking at all the good parts of it but also all of it's faults. Pixel Piracy is this special case where I absolutely adore the concept it delivers and the gameplay, but the execution is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful I can't bring myself to play it anymore, I wanted to play it to the end and explore everything, have a massive powerful crew that would dominate the seven seas. Instead we're left with a game that, to put it simply, is badly made. It doesn't work, and yet it 'released' mere days ago. Anyway, here's a list of about everything wrong with this game that will ruin your experience. Some issues may not seem important but do realize that all of them create unfair situations where the player is not at fault and yet the game will end up punishing them anyway or worse, just straight up giving them a situation they cannot get out of because of the god awful AI. So, here's the list.-Crew members acknowledge orders for maybe 1 second before ignoring it and going back to doing something that will probably get them killed or worse-Categorizing Crew members doesn't help much because giving them orders is a waste of time when they continue to do whatever the hell they want anyway. This can lead to crew members with no combat experience or health running out against high level pirates for no good reason. The above point also means that no matter how many times you try to move the low level crew member away from combat, they'll still just run back in and get themselves killed.-Your designated cook refuses to cook because you gave him a secondary job role and he's decided that's more important than cooking food for the captain or any of your crew which leads to the unfair death of you or your crew for no good reason other than the fact your cook decided that patching up the tiny bit of damage the ship took is more important than keeping the crew alive. The same goes for the cook having other jobs like Fishing. The same also happens if they're using interactable furniture like a Card set or Set of Swords. Apparently getting that straight flush is more important than helping your captain not starve to death. The same issue can also occur just from having your ship docked at an island, I don't know why it just bloody does.-Crew members who refuse to eat even when he's starving to death and you do actually have supplies of food. This relates to the above problem, if they have any kind of job or they're interacting with something menial, they will refuse to eat even when they're low on health because of starvation. This leads to numerous deaths.-Having multiple people who use cannons and multiple cannons and yet all of the crew members will use the same single cannon which makes it completely redundant, also half of the time a person who can use cannons simply won't for no reason-Crewmembers in combat refusing to target the enemy you picked for more than a second before choosing their own choice, which most of the time is the enemy with the most health instead of focusing down the person you just spent the last 30 seconds wittling down.-Ultimate skills are trash, it's impossible to tell when they're actually being used and that's because most of the time they're never being used, they're pointless and in 30 hours of playing I have only seen a crew member use one once, and it was useless-Selling cargo is useless and yields such a pathetic amount of gold. This is a game based around piracy, where people stole cargo from others to explot for themselves or sell for riches. In this however, you can steal hundreds of weapons, food and all sorts of other stuff and your reward for doing so is 1 gold per weapon no matter how powerful it is.Pixel Piracy is one of the most annoying games I have ever played. It doesn't listen. I don't think I've ever had to complain about a game not listening to me, where the AI is so brain dead that the simplest of concepts is beyond them, and it always ends up punishing you, for the developers misgivings. I can't recommend this game, please don't buy it in it's current state.

Klei Entertainment;Don't Starve Together;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy;R$ 492,82;UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.Starting off:Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and EndlessSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.Wilderness:  When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a "Jury-Rigged Portal" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the "Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).Characters -Wilson:Pros -Grows a beardCons - None.Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.Willow:Pros -Doesn't Take fire damageStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)Cons -When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest firesCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.Wolfgang:Pros -Gets stronger on a full stomachHas more hpCons - 1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomachMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomachLoses more sanity in Night / AfternoonAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only "Power up" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.Wendy:Pros -Has a ghost sisterDoesn't lose much sanity in darkCons -Does -.25% Less damage than all charactersLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail inWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.WX78:Pros - Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled /  Stale and take no penalty.Can be charged by lightningCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.Cons -Takes Damage in the rainStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.Wickerbottom:Pro -Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.Able to craft her own booksStarts off with 2 Papyrus.Cons -Can't SleepTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale foodWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books  you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY.

My farm was too big and I ran out of water, which led to my duplicants ("dupes" for short) getting sick, soiling themselves, and a life of misery. I started over.For the next 15 hours after that, I restarted repeated small colonies, armed with ideas from Reddit and Youtube on how to streamline systems, lay out your base WELL in advance, and improvise when challenges presented themselves.Finally, around the 30 hour mark, I decided to really dig my heels in. So far my colony has survived past cycle (day) 100, with clean oxygen aplenty, temperature under control, yummy food stores bursting at the seams, an efficient water recycling system, art and cleanliness in every room, a thorough hygienic system, renewable energy, and a small army of skilled dupes who can cover any specialty that my colony may need.And still, I fear that a single oversight may tip the first domino on my road to ruin.Improvisation is your best friend.

You get to trade off how fast you want the game to go by how willing you are to take on new dupes - lots of dupes can get things done quickly (sort of, eventually), but can also easily tip your colony rapidly over into chaos and destruction.  Keep your colony lean and mean and it's easier to retain control, but everything takes forever.The dupes have a suitably crappy AI.  I think it's intentional - it's kind of the point of the game that you basically can't rely on them to do anything right without either bullet-proof colony design and/or intense micromanaging of your little guys.  Beware the end of their shift for there is nothing more exasperating than a dupe literally dropping everything at just the wrong time, in just the wrong place, and go "Eatin' time!"It can rapidly become a full time job if you're not careful.  If you like your games feeling like a stressful engineering career then Oxygen Not Included is right up your alley.And it is an engineering game - it's all about systems, system planning, testing, iteration, identifying problems as soon as possible and prioritizing work to deal with the most pressing issues while not forgetting the longer term.  Rework/redesign is both inevitable and to be avoided as much as possible because there is nothing worse than finding a nasty flaw in one of your systems that will take another couple of hours to tear stuff down and rework to get around the flaw.  And working around an existing mostly functional system to patch in upgrades is messy and finicky.There are lots of tricks to ONI - quite a few become obvious as you get experience and it may be rewarding to figure those out for yourself.  Some are very particular to quirks in the way things are implemented in ONI - making use of these almost feels like an exploit, except they seem to be longstanding and just an accepted part of playing the game effectively.  Fluid airlocks. CO2 pits. the different ways to manage critters and plants - a wild critter or a wild plant may be much more valuable to you than a tame/farmed one. managing Pufts. managing Dreckos. which bits of tech are useful/critical, and which seem to be little more than red herrings designed to waste your time and resources. the weird way that fluids and gases work. the different ways that pipes/ducts/conveyor elements connect up, and the quite non-obvious but critical aspect that the white/green endpoints play in determining how flows are managed. heat and how to destroy it effectively. those dupe positive/negative traits, and which really really matter (and which negative traits are potentially actually positive traits). polluted water is in some ways superior to regular water, and is itself potentially a resource to be managed. how wires or pipes built in adjacent cells can be connected instantaneously without dupe involvement, but disconnecting them is a bit of a pain. Chlorine gas as a disinfectant, but nonsensically only outside of reservoirs, not inside them. digging diagonally is potentially incredibly useful when negotiating tricky environments - and how you can create vacuum conditions through such excavation. how vacuum works - the perfect insulator because they didn't model radiation for some reason. the weird pseudo physics in general, where things kind of seem like they're roughly modelled on real physics, but with major weirdness.My one longstanding real gripe about ONI is to do with the endgame (ETA: and seeing a recent post on the planned DLC it looks like Klei are in the process of radically reworking this in what sound like awesome ways!).  On paper the endgame has a lot of potential, but for a variety of reasons once you get into the rocketry phase I just found it to lose a lot of the vibrancy that marks the earlier parts of the game.  You aren't really facing survival challenges by the time you get to that point, it's just about scaling up your systems to deal with massive resource sinks, and that just gets a bit tedious.  I kind of feel that the systems that are there at the end now don't really fit - there is a 'tier' of resources and technology at the end that you can't really use as part of the survival/optimization game because you've basically run out of motivation at that point.  The survival pressure needed to be maintained, and getting access to resources of other planets feels like it should obviously have been an extension of the core game where you have to set up little mining/exploration bases on the other planetoids with even harsher environmental/logistical conditions and deal with having very limited supplies that you can send via the rockets, but otherwise make do as best you can with the resources on the remote planet.But still, it's a fantastic game for the most part, and it's way too easy to get caught up in it and have it haunting your thoughts at all times of the day and night.

Klei Entertainment;Invisible, Inc.;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 5,24;Invisible, Inc.  is a roguelike, turn-based, strategy stealth game. Moving past the buzzwords, it's a game where you move your units through randomized levels by observing the patterns of enemy movement and then avoiding them on your way to the exit point of the level. If you're lucky, you'll find some items or cash along the way. As you go further in the game, you face more and more dangerous enemies. Eventually you get spotted, die, and have to start again from the beginning. You do that last bit a lot, actually. I've noticed a lot people assuming that the game is similar to Shadowrun Returns or XCom due to the isometric perspective. It really isn't, and if you go in trying to play it that way you will end up being frustrated. Invisible, Inc. is a stealth game and a roguelike. Combat is difficult and usually not an effective way to deal with enemies. Also, it is a roguelike, to the extent that word still means anything, and you will most likely fail a lot as you learn how to play, and sometimes just because the random number generator screwed you over. How much you enjoy it will depend on your tolerance for that sort of thing.Also, this being early access, there's always the question of whether the creators are going to actually finish the game. Klei is a pretty well established company at this point, and they previously did a public beta similar to early access with their game Don't Starve. Personally, I think they're trustworthy based on that track record. Not that I'm an expert or anything.;Recommended;34.7;19/08/2014;412;N/I
Klei Entertainment;Invisible, Inc.;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 5,24;Despite the high positive review % this game is criminally underplayed and I believe I can provide some insight that isn't covered in the other reviews and also address some points from the negative reviews because they may deter people that would otherwise enjoy this game and get their money's worth. That said I will be as objective as possible.First thing, this is pure turn based strategy gameplay. The campaign and storyline is there but you need to enjoy the raw gameplay in order to appreciate this game. Despite what you've been told the 'stealth' part is completely optional. it can be as disgustingly brutal as you want it to be. My preferred end-game is to kill everything and I've found the right setup to make it extremely effective. Winning isn't about figuring out what strategy works. they all 'work' even on the 'Expert' difficulty. The reason Expert is considered by Klei to be the intended difficulty is because it's the hardest preset that doesn't limit your options. Specifically 'Expert Plus' only discourages knocking out guards until you get EMP access but I don't expect anyone who hasn't played the game to know what I'm talking about here. just know that even the "hardest" difficulty still only limits your strategical options temporarily.I can accept most negative opinions of some features but my major gripe is their point about the RNG. Take it from me. you do not lose because of RNG when playing on a preset difficulty (not custom settings). In most cases blaming RNG on your loss is a clear case of the Dunning-Kruger effect. You lose because you made strategical or tactical mistakes. Of course everyone makes careless mistakes from time to time and Invisible Inc acknowledges and embraces that with a number of "rewinds" that essentially legitimises save-scumming.There is an alarm system that increments every turn, adding difficulty over time throughout each mission. Some opinions express distaste for it but I think it's great. Historically most stealth games are very easy. you can be as patient as you'd like and often killing or incapacitating people has no repercussions. If that's the requirement for stealth games then this isn't one. It's a strategy game first and foremost, and a very unique one.Overall this game isn't easy at the higher difficulties. Beginner exists for a reason so it's ok if you can't brain. If you let it this game will teach you how to brain. Not recommended under the influence of alcohol or sleep deprived, or try anyway, whatever. Fight me in the comments, on the forums, or real life.;Recommended;770.8;9/12/2016;186;17
Klei Entertainment;Invisible, Inc.;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 5,24;All right, so I do recommend the game, but I'll say right away that it's easily not for everyone. In short, if you're expecting a well-pieced together story, you won't find it here, but if you're after a rogue-like turn-based dungeon crawler, then this game will be right up your alley.The presentation is probably the game's biggest strength. It's put together well in shiny visuals, clean UI, and a fun gameplay concept that takes isometric turn-based combat and makes it stealth-oriented, where you're better off avoiding the enemies rather than engaging in fights. The game is fun, if you enjoy turn-based tactics that let you plan your every ally's move.The gameplay concept is solid, but some of its execution was a fair bit annoying to me personally. A lot of the challenge presented felt simply artificial and unfair. The raising security level each and every turn forces you to rush each mission. Exploration is simply not rewarded under this system, because the longer you stay on your mission, the more security measures will be added after every few turns, which will eventually put you in a tight spot. I never came across any way for me to freeze or reduce the security level. It's just a rush against time, but on turn-based basis.I was also not fond of the fact that I couldn't buy any equipment for my party in between missions. The only time I could do it was if I happened to find an automated shop during missions, when I had virtually no money to spend. Of 4 agents I had in my missions, 2 were running about without weapons and just being used to sit on the guards. This brings me to another annoyance. If you don't have a weapon, you have no way to deal with the guards. No idea what sort of agents these are who can't even take out a guard from behind unless they have a tazer. Things start to get more complex when you meet enemies in armour, who are invulnerable to most weapons, and your only chance is to play a cat and mouse game where you're constantly running away.But, I really did like being able to improve my agents in between missions by upgrading their stats, even if stats themselves did feel a bit unbalanced. Speed felt like the most useful stat by far, since it gave you more action points, with hacking being a close second, since everything requires hacking. But strength and anarchy felt next to useless. Strength only lets you carry more items, and anarchy makes you steal slightly more money from the guards.And lastly the story, well, it was mostly on the background. The most of it you'll see is in the opening and ending cutscenes. But the rest of the game you're just dungeon-crawling really. It was pretty neat to get to pick which mission to do from a wide selection. It's very non-linear and each mission simply increases your assets - either you rescue an extra agent to add to the team, or you find some new shiny gear to use. Though because of that, it also meant that there were no story-related reasons to do any mission. You could expect the same approach in each one and merely doing as many as you can to pass 72 hours in-game before having to do the final one with what you've got.I was also hoping there'd be some more character development. All the agents in your team were just mute puppets for you to control. They never showed any personality or had anything to say aside from a witty one-liner at the start of each mission.Having said this, if you are a dungeon-crawl fanatic and like challenge, you should enjoy this game very much. It has higher difficulty modes, as well as an endless mode too where you have to survive for as long as you can. Overall, it's a worthy game to try and I have had my fair share of fun with it, even though the main campaign is rather on the short side.;Recommended;7.7;10/07/2015;271;10
Klei Entertainment;Invisible, Inc.;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 5,24;"Invisible, Inc." is a one-of-a-kind and an instant classic. As a turn-based strategy game, it requires a high level of planning and strategy to succeed. This is compounded by the "rouguelike" aspect of the game, meaning that you are not allowed to reload a previous save if you screw up. Depending on the difficulty level you choose, you may either have the ability to retry the level, use a limited number of "rewinds" which bring you back to the beginning of the previous turn, or, on "ironman mode," have no safety net at all, meaning if you lose your team it is time to start a new game.This unforgiving style is compounded by the seemingly unfairness of the fight. You are outnumbered and outgunned, infiltrating unknown enemy territory (levels are randomly generated), and you must rely on your stealth and cunning to make it through. Still, there are a number of tools at your disposal: distraction techniques, lethal and non-lethal attacks, a wide variety of powers and gadgets that range from traps to cloaking devices, and a hacking system that targets the various devices found in the level allowing you to access, disable, or remotely command them.While there are some random elements to the game that vary the way each run plays out (such as which types of missions are available, the layouts of each level, and items/powers you find on the way), the rest of the game is very deterministic. If you are very careful and diligent, you can play the enemy like a fiddle, pulling them this way and that so that your other agents can reach the mission objective (and/or rob the corporations blind). However, screw-ups do happen, and when they do, the situation can plunge from "astounding success" to "catastrophic failure" very quickly. There is no HP meter for your agents. If they are shot, they are permanently downed until another agent either drags them to the exit (leaving them vulnerable in the process) or revives them with Med Gel (which you may have inconveintly left behind to make room for that fantastic new gadget). It is possible to go on without them, but later missions are only going to be harder and it may be next-to-impossible to succeed with an under-manned team.Hacking is a vital part of the game in order to get past cameras and drones - and to access the various "shops" that come in the form of firewalled terminals found inside the levels. The hacking system is, in some ways, a game within a game. You can switch between the "real world" and the "virtual world" of your A.I., Incognita. Everything she does requires power. Power can be generated by programs within Incognita, or through the actions of your agents (such as using their cybernetic augments or ordering them to hack consoles). This adds yet another layer of complexity to the game. If you are being hunted by guards and barely staying afloat, the last thing you want is to run out of power and get spotted on camera because you couldn't hack it. It leads to situations where you are running risky maneuvers in order to get to consoles, just so you can proceed unhindered through the rest of the level. The number of hazards, and their respective firewall levels, is increased each turn, so careful planning and efficient power usage is essential.In the end, the beauty of "Invisible, Inc." is its balance and the choices it forces you to make. It is both ruthlessly hard and extremely satisfying when you make it through a level without a hitch. You must choose between dodging past enemies, knocking them out for a couple turns, or killing them, each of which has its own concequences. You have to choose between that awesome gadget or a new hacking program that will help you with the increasingly difficult firewalls. You may have to choose to end your campaign or limp along with an under-manned team because your agent was seperated from the rest of the team and shot. This, and the huge variety of strategies available, make it a wildly satisifying experience. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys strategy games.;Recommended;263.4;12/06/2017;99;1
Klei Entertainment;Invisible, Inc.;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 5,24;Nobody does stealth like Klei!  If you enjoyed playing Tenchu: Stealth Assassin on PS1, you need this game.If you enjoy XCOM (the original or the reboot), you need this game.If you've ever seen an episode of Mission:Impossible, you need this game.If you enjoy "Rogue-likes", you need this game.Invisible, Inc. puts you in a dangerous, near-future, 1984-esque big brother world of mega-corporations gone bad, with nothing to survive on but your wits and the specialized abilities of your hand-picked team of professional spies.  The game plays like a "run and hide" XCOM.  The goal here is not to storm the battlements, mow down the guards, and plant a flag over their corpses.  You're outnumbered, outgunned, and certain death waits around every blind corner.  In true espionage fashion, if your team has to pull their guns, it means you've screwed the pooch, your team is compromised, and now you're in a desperate firefight to sprint to the exit before the corporate army seals off the building.At the beginning, you pick two team members, whose special abilities will dictate your play style through an increasingly punishing randomly-generated corporate maze.  You can bring a sniper, sure!  But maybe a computer expert would be less noticeable than gunshots ringing through the halls.  Or you can bring a stealthy lockpicker, but then who's going to judo chop the guards when they show up wearing body armor? Along the way, you may have the opportunity to rescue captured agents and increase your team's size.  The agents available to be rescued are randomized, creating a different play experience each time.The graphics and sound create an inviting, futuristic pulp-fiction atmosphere.  The music is appropriately dangerous, and fitting to the Mission: Impossible play style.  There are a ton of options to make the game easier or harder in whatever way you choose, so you can pick your own challenge level, from a casual romp through a save-scumming corp beatdown to hardcore, ironman, no going back, the-T-1000-is-after-you mode.Get it.

Klei Entertainment;Invisible, Inc.;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 5,24;An incredible stealth tactical game that has you infiltrate facilities as a group of cyberpunk rebels who get one-shot in any direct confrontation. It's part XCOM, part Into the Breach: there's no randomness in numbers, and you can get all the information you need (like guard routes). However, to spy on them efficiently, you need to take risks and scout ahead... which is dangerous.The game is balanced perfectly. The alarm is constantly rising, pressuring you out of overly cautious playstyle, but get too cocky—and you get wiped. Unlike XCOM, you can't really clear the level: you stun enemies instead of killing them, and if you dawdle, they'll come to and set after you from behind. The tension becomes very real, very quickly.The visuals are clear and memorable, the characters likeable, and the music pleasant. The only downsides I can think of is that the rules of vision become complicated sometimes (it might be hard to figure out in a crowded room if your hiding place will fall into a guard's field of vision as they move). and also that your success heavily depends on the random level generation: if the two objectives of the last mission are in two different ends of the map, you'll be heavily disadvantaged compared to someone who gets them close.Then again, the latter is balanced by how short the campaign is. If you fail—which you will—you won't feel like you've lost a ton of progress, and starting over doesn't feel like a chore.All in all, a great tactical game for anyone who loves to think on the grid and plan their every step.

Klei Entertainment;Invisible, Inc.;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 5,24;This game is incredible. It has been quite a while since I had the effect of "What? Already 3 in the morning? But ... one more mission ...." (it is 3:33 AM as I write this)Klei took all the good things about round-based strategy from the big brother XCOM and added their experience with stealth games and some unique gameplay ideas to the mix and ... it works perfectly. To round it all up they got some rogue-like elements like permadeath for the agents and (depending on the difficulty) very limited possibilities to retry. But failing the short campaign (took me 5 hours on first try on beginner difficulty) will always yield some XP that unlocks new agents and abilities for the next round. That alone would be enough for a great little game but Klei also shows again just how good they got with art and design.

You only have enough power to hack one of the drones. What do you do?http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495237730I don't think there's ever been a game more consistently suspenseful as Invisible Inc. Even when you dance around guards and fill your accounts with corporate capital uncontested you aren't allowed to forget for a minute that it only takes one miscalculation to launch you into a freefall. The biggest credit for this goes to the alarm mechanic. Invisible makes detection a matter of unavoidable, gradually advancing doom rather than a fail state or an excuse to turn itself into an inferior action game.The alarm level creeps upwards with your every turn and every mistake, introducing new security measures and guards into the level, and not a single one of the many gadgets and programs available to your agents can do so much as slow it down. It will only stop when the sirens are blaring, private military troops are flooding the building and your agents are darting frantically from room to room, burning through every item and augmentation they have in order to stave off death for just a little while longer.Invisible isn't a game about avoiding detection, it's about surviving it.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495237777The core of the game, sneaking from cover to cover and ambushing guards, is immediately intuitive. Instead of of deriving false depth from superfluous mechanics it sets up complex situations and tough choices with just a few precision-designed rules. Things are mixed up by the equipment salvaged from the field, ranging from movement-boosting stimulants to electric door traps. Customization isn't the right word here, though - your resources are always scarce so you must take whatever you can find and build your strategy around that. Plans only last minutes before being replaced by mad improvisation.Let's go back Dr. Xu and his predicament. Maybe he found a rudimentary invisibility rig in the previous mission, not powerful enough to get him out of the drone's field of view but allowing him to run up to it and temporarily disable it with his EMP tool, an augment only he has access to. Or perhaps Decker can use a stimulant to gain just enough action points to reach the room and gun the drone down. Or maybe there's no way out, but Xu survives his injuries and can be recovered from a detention center later on.Oh, and the corporations aren't short of tricks either. The reason Xu got caught? He opened a safe after you triggered a countermeasure program that sets an alarm to all containers on the level. And what if the program was activated by you stunning that same drone that's now threatening Xu so he could sneak to the safes undetected? This is where Invisible Inc. really shines - being a host to a multitude of tactical causes and effects without ever being overwhelming, and never letting you settle into a comfortable routine like many of its peers, even classics, do.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495237816The soundtrack punctuates the action with surprising vigour and demonstrates some of the best use of reactive music since Proteus. When the tension rises, so does the tempo, making sure your heart will pump faster and faster as the alarm tracker keeps filling up. Likewise the art design is just as slick as one can hope for, taking a good step forward from Mark of the Ninja's and Don't Starve's Saturday morning look while still staying recognizably within Klei's house style.As cool as its presentation is, in terms of UI design Invisible does stumble into an occasional tripwire. Finding the correct button to hack that pesky camera instead of a nearby server computer requires a bit too much fiddling with the camera than I'd like, and the times I've found myself unwittingly knocking out a guard with a conciousness monitor suggests that the varying abilities of guards and drones could be more clearly communicated. These are very minor gripes though, and would be hardly noticed if the rest of the game wasn't so well-crafted.It is tempting to call Invisible an almost-perfect clockwork of a game but that would hardly do justice to the terror and triumph it evokes each mission and each turn. Every drop of sweat and tears I shed over it makes me more convinced that I'm looking at a future classic. It is the kind of a game that will creep into your mind and steal your heart.;Recommended;131.1;6/08/2015;116;9

Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;Mark of the Ninja is an aesthetically pleasing, 2-D, stealth-based, side-scrolling platformer...a.k.a. a masterpiece. For those of you who want a brief overview without looking at it in the steam store, think of it as combining the best qualities of Thief, Dishonored, and Assassin's Creed and giving it all to you in a different, albeit wonderful, 2-D perspective. To give you a sense of the story itself, you play as a ninja (no way, right?) who accepts the "First Mark," a tattoo which imbues mystical powers to the one who accepts it upon their body. While this seems like a fantastic benefit, accepting the mark means sacrificing yourself in the future because the ink is said to drive people to insanity (e.g., hallucinations). Your purpose-without spoilers-is to avenge your clan that was recently attacked by an evil arms corporation by utilizing your newly-acquired powers. As the story progresses, you receive more marks, more abilities, and more means to uncover the irreconcilable truth about your role, your clan itself, and those of power who essentially mean to save and/or destroy it. Now if this hasn't already got you hooked or clicking off of my review to go buy it, then please allow me to further elaborate the feel of the gameplay. Mark of the Ninja does not care precisely how you play the game...to a certain extent. Yes, the stealth aspect is a given. This is not simply because this is the major theme/tag for the game itself (who knew?), but also because while you can dish out hits, you can't take many more hits than other enemies in the game. This is exceedingly true if you try to go in "weapons blazing" (expect to be punished and killed relentlessly if you do this). Despite this sometimes perceived "limitation" by some players, there are multiple routes and means of accomplishing each level through various stealth-based tactics. You can choose to be cruel, fast, and terrorizing, or merciful, meticulous, and tactful--or even a mix of these depending on the situation/your mood at any given moment! That's one of the most glorious aspects of the game: Freedom of choice to accomplish objectives. Combine this with the gorgeous settings for each level, and the 2-D game does not feel at all linear or dimensionally flat. Finally, there are a couple of minor details I'd like to state that may or may not apply to other players (skip this if you like): 1) I admit that I played this game on steam with an Xbox 360 controller and not with the keyboard and mouse. I recommend doing so for the sake of the ease of controls. However, you may have your own preferences and be able to get used to keyboard/mouse controls faster in comparison to me.2) At some points my computer lagged terribly due to how many various processes were going on in the game with the visual effects (e.g., when there was a raging sandstorm in one level). The creators even comment upon this minor flaw if you turn on the in-game commentary within the game itself (which I also recommend because it reveals some really awesome facets of the making of the game!). 3) Mark of the Ninja is a highly addictive game with major replay value. It took me 14 hours to complete it the first time through, and I intend on replaying it once again on new game+ mode in the future.Hopefully, all of the aforementioned reasons will sway you to spend some money in steam to purchase a game that has certainly left its "mark" on me. Please don't think me insane for adamantly urging you to acquire this game instead of letting it sneak past some gamers unnoticed. I recommend picking it up immediately, but if you want to wait until it goes on sale in the steam store that's fine too. I doubt it will let you down regardless :) In short, Mark of the Ninja gets a well-deserved 10/10 (ninja) stars in my book, and I'd like to thank Klei Entertainment for allowing me to play through this utterly amazing story.;Recommended;13.9;2/11/2014;142;7

Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;A superb 2D platform stealth game. Lots of fun and great value for money.One of those games that caught me by suprise and opened my eyes to the world of 2D stealth games, Mark of the Ninja is a fairly simple idea. You are a 'ninja' that is granted special powers and a terrible curse, and you must fulfill your deadly mission. How? Will stealth, cunning and an array of cool powers and fun gadgets.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOJdgO40KU;Recommended;26.1;3/01/2015;125;3
Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;Mark of the Ninja is a mix between 2D platform and stealth killing, in wich you can always clearly see what's happening around you, making it easy to plan your moves.Controls are greatly responsive and you have a good variety of ways to complete the interesting and diversified levels, in wich you can find optional stuff and complete secondary objectives. this and a New Game+ option make it easily replayable.Graphics are very clear, and overall style is enjoyable.Story felt uninteresting to me, but with solid mechanics like the ones this game has I can deal with it.;Recommended;38.9;25/11/2013;210;2
Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;Title: This confused me for a while. I interpreted it in a manner similar to "George of the Jungle", and spent a good space of time believing that the protagonist was named Mark. Somewhere, deep in my heart, I still believe his name is Mark. As such, I will be referring to the protagonist as Mark for the duration of this review, and afterwards as well. Graphics: It's like playing a cartoon which is kind of cool. I watched Samurai Jack one time, and he was pretty neat. I like to consider Mark as like his cousin on his mother's husband's side or something. The graphics contain many cool features such as ninjas, lights, and enemies. Some people consider the characters to be two-dimensional, but I think that they're just drawn that way so we shouldn't make fun of them. Everything is nice and fluid, it's like the characters are made of water or maybe filled with *blood. Sound: The characters have voices and they use them to say things like"HURGH" or "BLARGLREGARGLEBLARGH" when you stab themGameplay: Gameplay is very stealth-centric, meaning it may be difficult to notice at first. Once you manage to spot it, however, you'll be hooked. And so will the guards. There are lots of great ways to sneak around, like kill the guards, or hide from the guards, or scare the guards so much that they shoot their friends and kill them for you #Teamwork2014 #JustGuardThings #Livin'ItYou get gadgets and they're usefulYou can think in this game, and I've grown to appreciate how thinking stops time so you can decide where you want to throw things like darts and smoke bombs. I find it very distracting how much the game is based on distraction and getting guards to squander their attention on arbitrary things in the environment like the noise mine you threw behind them. Story: Mark bears the mark of the ninja, which gives him extra abilities. One of those abilities is the ability to take Revengeance upon the bad guys by killing them and stuff. Another ability is to go insane and kill your friends, which would be sad, but I guess they'd stop being your friends when they saw you trying to kill them so then you wouldn't be killing your friends it would just be a mob of angry dead not-friend ninjas which is entirely morally justifiable by comparison. Title: 1Sounds: a lotGraphics: Probably more than ten, I wasn't really counting when I played it so I dont know the exact number of graphical assets involvedStory: 2 if you have the DLC thing, 3 if you count the two different endings based on your final choice. ---------------------------Total: pretty good game, almost bought again but realized that would be pointless*This has, in multiple instances of gameplay, been confirmed true.;Recommended;9.4;29/01/2014;211;95
Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;Do you like ninjas? Real ninjas?Buy this game.Please join me as I explain why this game deserves TONS of praise and credit.There are many ninjas in video games. Being a gamer, youve probably heard of a few of them. Ryu Hayabusa from ninja gaiden. Strider from his self titled games, Scorpion and sub zero from mortal kombat, Grey Fox from metal gear, etc, etc.But you havent heard of the main character of Mark of the Ninja. because nobody has. And why havent they? BECAUSE HES ACTUALLY A NINJA.In popular culture, ninjas have turned into something that they historically never were to pander to the masses. They are portrayed (in games, movies, cartoons, and all popular media) as super invincible Rambos who come in and lethally destroy hundreds of people who should on all accounts kill them immediately. theyre given super human strength, agility, reflexes, to the point of being rediculous, because people like to watch that. It makes them appeal to the audiences who want to watch them do exactly that. The problem is that is NOT what ninjas did. In fact, you couldnt make them do anything that was MORE against the souce material.The biggest point to this that makes it kind of insulting is that they are making these changes to ninjas to make them more badass, when ninjas were already badass to begin with, and didnt need any help. The art of the ninja was the art of nonexistence. They were shadows. Whispers. They were sent on missions that noone else could be sent on. They would sneak through places undetected to gather information, or yes, sometimes to assassinate people. They were very skilled at killing people, but did so ONLY at the absolute last resort, to prevent themselves from being discovered. They kept their identities secret. They covered their faces. They tried their hardest to NOT EXIST.The fact that everyone knows ryu hayabusa and strider (even in their oen worlds) and that characters like them run around in the open massacreing hundreds of people and not caring who knows means that they are NOT ninjas. not even that they are bad ninjas. they arent ninjas at all. This game lets you play as a REAL ninja, and is one of the only examples of a game Ie seen that actually lets you do that. You cant fight the gaurds, or at least its VERY difficult to beat them in combat, even one on one. Why? I thoght you were a ninja? You are, but they have GUNS. Just because youre a ninja doesnt give you the ability to easily defeat a trained soldier with a loaded gun in fair combat. But you can very easily defeat them if you sneak up on them. thats what a ninja would do if he had to kill. the game also gives you extra points for hiding bodies, which is again, what a ninja would do. The game gives you MORE points if you can go through the level without killing people or being detected. The goals a ninja would have. The game is very fun. and it points out that you can have  REAL ninja, as opposed to a hollywood ninja, and still be badass. arguably even more badass. Give the game a try.;Recommended;7.9;28/10/2016;124;12
Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;I'm long time due with a review about Mark of the Ninja, as it's gameplay and way of presentation captivated me from it's first level.Gameplay-wise the game is an stealth game - but unlike games like Thief series, here you can dispatch your enemies in various ways - if you want to. You can arm yourself with incredible variety of tools - you can change your skin/cloth, resulting in a different combat style that can alter your health, pool of distraction or offense items, and sometimes introducing unique traits to that combat style.I mentioned items - you can use sound crackers to throw and distract your enemies, flares to make them dizzy or blind, a good old cardboard box to hide in plain view, or some bombs, plus some extra. In addition, all items have upgrades, for example smoke bomb blocks laser path and vision, but the upgraded one chokes and stuns enemies unlucky enough to be caught inside the cloud.If you're into more offensive gameplay, you can use darts that will incite terror in your poor victim, who will see enemies in every corner, very likely killing his guard-mates. Or you can use flesh-devouring bugs to make a body disappear or kill someone in a noisy fashion *yikes*, or a spike trap... Besides the straight "kill the poor sod who's targeted" effect offensive weapons are very likely will plant fear in other enemies who see their friends perish, so these simple tools actually have much more strategic usage as it would seem.Or who need tools? You're a ninja! You can get upgrades that improves your hand-to-hand skills by giving takedown abilities, various ways to catch your enemies off-guard by attacking from above, below, or behind close doors, or you can learn how to float a while after a jump!The best thing in all of these upgrades that there is no skill tree, no various classes - you unlock whatever you want if you have enough points for them. Said points can be acquired by completing levels with 1-2-3 medals - this require you to get enough points for the three tiers.And now after mentioning points, back to the gameplay. Getting points is actually really easy, and easy to count on. You can get points for killing an enemy, hiding the body, distracting them in various ways, passing them unnoticed, panicking them, etc, etc. The game is made in a way that it can be completed in a non-lethal fashion (though as story requires you to kill the target, he and his guard in chief are killed in both gameplay styles) and you can still easily get enough point on a level to get all 2 medals.The game plays wonderfully. Movement is responsive and easy to get used to, the game features a focus mode that's not breaking the game's immersion while let you aim carefully with your tools / re-think your strategy. All the weapons are very easy to use, their indicators are clear, while the whole system absolutely lacks the feel of spoonfeeding. Basically the game features a system that makes really easy to use your gadgets but doesn't really limits you how and when to use them - for good or bad, depending on your choices and the ability of aim that pesky smoke bomb :)I wanted to point out another feature in the game: New Game Plus. You can keep everything you have from the first gameplay, and the game reasonably makes the game more difficult. Guns will kill in one shot, enemies' cone of sight will be invisible, there won't be visual feedback about how far some noises can be heard, and you too will get a cone of sigh: anything above, below or behind you will be heavily blurred. I was tremendously happy to see such change in the game, because the game's difficulty scales not by the number of the enemies, but making the game technically harder, requiring more attention (Which shouldn't be hard after completing it beforehand)The game's visual presentation can be seen as plain at a first glance because of the lot of dark areas, but it's really accurate and original. Various styled levels are presented across the game, from the modern city with it's stark edges, catacombs with darkness and decayed, uneven surfaces to the ruins of an old city where most things just want to fall apart, resulting in various traps unique to that few level.   Between the levels the cutscenes use cartoon-like style, which really fits the overall design, and it's really well done - features tell-tale facial expressions while masking parts of the story. Obviously, there's a lot of work in writing the game's story and make the story, design, style, gameplay elements to fit together. And as a last thing, still part of the graphical feats I'd like to mention one of the game's cutscene (no spoilers) I've found uploaded here: and the game's final level as both are gems of the art-like presentation in games - I'm sure I'll remember the closing level of the game in decades, it was so strong and influential, uncovering some things from the story while letting others in darkness. Feel free to look it up, but I won't link it here, being an obvious spoiler.At the end, if I'd need to rephrase all these things in a sentence of two, it would be pretty hard, as there's so much great things to say about the game, while I haven't found any negatives. The game perfectly mixes the elements of platformer and stealth games supported by a great variety of tools and moves to enhance the gameplay, while staying similarly outstanding level design, storytelling and art style. Huge bonus point for alternate non-lethal ways, and letting the player experience and discover parts of the levels and the story, the forced focus from cutscenes could have destroy the player's pace, and spoil the feeling of true discovery or enlightenment.One of the best and most rewarding games I've been playing - I honestly recommend it to anyone who likes platform based and stealth(y) games.;Recommended;42.9;25/10/2015;92;5
Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;Before the chit-chat, let me say something upfront: Mark of the Ninja is an exceptional stealth-action game, that will change your way of thinking about Indie titles if you had ambiguous feelings before. It isn't simply a great game, but also has character, story, depth and uniqueness.Our hero is an unnamed ninja of the Hisomu clan. Just after getting tattooed with an ink from a special flower that will make him have extraordinary power his clan is attacked by soldiers and his mentor is taken hostage. After freeing him, the journey begins. Yes, it's revenge time. It's not the most well cooked stories out there and the ending lacks a real punch, but from an indie title of this kind it's very ambitious. After sending our hero on his mission it is explained to him that the ink under his skin not only will make him stronger but after some time it'll drive him mad. Before that could happen he sworn to commit suicide. But, the mission first.As we progress through the levels our hero will learn (we unlock) new abilities that help us deal with enemy soldiers. With the increasing number of light sources, lasers, detectors and enemies the game gets more and more challenging, but never too difficult to frustrate the player. With common sense and orientation you can always find the right path to clear the room or pass by the enemies undetected.And exactly this is the biggest fun source of the game. There isn't a definite way to finish a level or even to solve a room. You have a wast array of items you can choose from and you can use any environmental object to be successful. You rarely HAVE to kill a guard to reach the next room, there's always a second option.The game tracks your progress all the time. Finishing a level without being detected or doing all the side tasks in a level will earn you more points to spend on special abilities and more effective distraction/attack items.When you feel the game is beginning to get somewhat repetitive it always throws you something new to play with, to make the fun lasting. You can even change your outfit after some time. And this isn't a pointless dress change you see in many games. With the new suit you get new abilities, but you're reduced with other ones. It is really awesomely balanced, where everybody can find the clothes that fit the player's style.With exceptional game design comes exceptional art design. The game isn't the most beautiful you've ever seen nor packs the most polygons, but it's art and it's unique. On the audio side the lighting strikes and dog sniffles are great. The OST consists of well composed pieces that support the ninja-feel and stealth nature of the game.After finishing the game you can start again on New Game + mode which is essentially a hard mode and it's really challenging where your viewing angles are reduced and the enemies are more aware.Mark of the Ninja executes and delivers on every part you can imagine. It's a definitive standard for indie titles. If you like stealth games, play it. If you like 2D action games, play it. If you like platformers, play it. If you want to have fun, definitely play this piece! And, well...ninjas and stuff.Rating: 89/100. Replay Value: 4/5. To Beat: 10-11 hours.;Recommended;10.8;6/10/2013;115;N/I
Klei Entertainment;Mark of the Ninja;Action, Adventure, Indie;None;AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Mark of the Ninja Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: 2D. Stealth. Platformer. Action. Ninja  My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre. Those intrigued by the genre. Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWMark of the Ninja is an instant indie classic.  It is very easy to digest and has an alluring simplicity to it. but at the same time it boasts exciting gameplay and a very refined atmosphere.  Elements of 2D platforming, stealth, and action combine to create a distinguished and enjoyable identity for the game. If you generally appreciate this style of game, then you should consider checking out Mark of the Ninja.The core gameplay is relatively simple and easy to dive right into.  The controls are mostly comfortable and intuitive, and the design style allows each person to tailor their play to their preferences.  Each mission allows for a little improvisation at times, as there are often different routes you can take to reach your goals. And as you unlock new items and abilities, you can experiment with new approaches to keep the game fresh.    There isn't much per way of the story, but there is enough information offered to give you a basic purpose to your actions. But even though the story elements are minimal, the game has an outstanding atmosphere.  The art style is very pleasing, especially the hand-painted backdrops. And the lighting effects are exquisite, particularly due to the importance of staying in the shadows. Add in the fitting weather effects and the soundscape and you are left with a truly pleasurable and captivating atmosphere. Mark of the Ninja also was designed to be challenging without being overly difficult. I personally felt that it was perfectly balanced to not be too easy and not be too hard, dwelling within that perfect “Goldilocks-zone” that allows the game to appeal to a vast majority of gamers. And since most people won’t be able to just breeze right through it unchallenged, it can take over a dozen hours to complete— even though it isn’t necessarily a long game. On top of that, there is also a NewGame+ mode to add some replay value for those who would be interested.In summary, I posit that grabbing Mark of the Ninja is an easy choice for any true fan of the genre. And due to the high quality of the game design, I also would suggest that more casual fans of the genre give it some strong consideration as well.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!;Recommended;30.0;23/04/2016;88;N/I
Klei Entertainment;Hot Lava;Action, Adventure, Indie, Racing;None;Bought this for my 6 year old. He really likes it. I've sat and watched him play this every time and have been surprised by how fun it is to watch as well as play.Like all Klei games there's many hours of fun to be had with this title. Lets start with the basics:* I like the controls (WASD, spacebar and the occasional Ctrl)* I like the aesthetics - they makes sense in relation to the games theme* The sounds/music are fun and fitting* There is a plot kinda, it's more of a in-game world set up. As a kid you are either the toy or the kid pretending to be the character of the toy irl. It's all fun and harmless stuff with plenty of bios and comics to unlock to add flavour to each toy/character you can go.* There's loads (at least there seems to be) of cosmetics to unlock in-game without the need to spend additional money.Although my son hasn't played this game for a million plus hours it's clear as day the game isn't gonna change beyond either what he's already experienced or what I expect from experience and that's perfectly fine.A fun game that's good for all ages.EDIT:So I asked my son if he'd like to share anything since he's the one playing it, he had the following to share:Me (after explaining what a review and recommendation is) - "So would you recommend it?"My son - "Yes because it has a lot of erm like I like all the details and how quick you get items. I like how much characters you get and you can literally put silly hats on them and it's so funny. There's a lava one and I put a chicken head on him.

Coffee Stain Studios;Deep Rock Galactic;Action;R$ 102,69;Rock and Stone, reader, take a moment to read my review : In an era of unyielding greed where publishers release half-arsed games with day-one DLCs, an era where graphics are put before gameplay, an era of toxicity where people are just after their high score and shiny cosmetics - comes one of Steam's most underrated games : Deep Rock Galactic ! Yes I dare say Underrated !A game where you dig ore, and fight bugs . Simple as ? There is plenty of variation, and the developers make sure to periodically add something new to the mix - something new that is not behind any pay-wall or trickery.The moment you buy the game, there is no need to pay for anything else, unless you want to support the developers and get some tasteful , world-coherent cosmeticsGhost Ship Games have created a gameplay loop that is simplistic enough to follow , yet compelling enough that it does not get repetitive . Ever been into one of those co-op games where if one person has the wrong item or load-out, everyone loses ? Well not here, all builds are viable - no cookie cutting required, just point at the bug and shoot at it simple as .These people have put quality and community first and foremost But the most beautiful thing about this game is one simple thing, one thing that I have never seen in an online game in a long time and never to this extend : Cooperation ! You have never seen a game where strangers will work together and help each other quite like this . It's as if going back to the first days of a MMORPG where everyone is just glad to be there and glad to fulfill their roleIn the deep dangerous depths of Hoxxes, you aren't just the employees of a mysterious interplanetary mining corporation, you are not just strangers on a job - you are Brothers You must have played one of those mmorpgs where you just rush rush rush to the next objective ! Next marker, next checklist, next SHINY - when was the last time you danced and slammed ales with your brothers just for the fun of it ?! Well in this game, that is what you do bestThis "silly game about dwarves" has more soul into it than most games released within the last ten years , here in the big cold web you can find friendship .If you decide to buy this game, be sure to be the dwarf you wish to have at your side !

Coffee Stain Studios;Deep Rock Galactic;Action;R$ 102,69;I have played this game for a long while with friends and enjoyed every moment of it.My wife, who is new to gaming and generally does not play any type of FPS saw us playing this and was curious about it, so I decided to gift it to her on steam to see if she would enjoy it. I fully expected her to play it for about one or two missions and lose interest, as she generally does not have the knack for playing games that require focus and she doesn't enjoy games that have a gathering aspect.She chose Gunner, loaded into the game and proceeded to unleash hell on bugs, and on our entire team in the process. While she doesn't understand what's going on most of the time, she loves shooting the bugs and always gets excited when Mission Control yells "SWARM! It's a big one team!" laughing maniacally as she lobs sticky grenades all over the place. I have made sure that she unlocked the friendly fire perk to try and mitigate the damage she does to her teammates.I have always found this game to be incredibly fun, but now, with my wife in the game, it's hilarious. It's heartwarming to see her enjoying herself and having her come home from work and look at me and ask "space dwarves after dinner?"

Missions vary in length—you can select one that fits your needs.   Too repetitive. Procedurally generated maps. Multiple biomes with unique flora and fauna. Many different mission types. Mission modifiers (“Warnings” and “Anomalies”). Seasonal events and updates.   Communication with others is too cumbersome. Laser pointer takes care of many basics, like (“go here” or “mine here” or “resupply here”). Often accompanied by relevant voice lines. Of course, you can still type or use voice chat.   Singleplayer is too lonely or too unbalanced. Bosco.    No cosmetics. Plenty of cosmetics. There’s enough there to where you don’t need to spend real money.   Doesn’t fit on my hard drive/SSD. Requires only 3 GB of storage.   Created by a big corporation that:1) Doesn’t care about its players2) Exists for the sole purpose of generating as much profit as possible Developed by a small team that genuinely cares about the game and its players.

Coffee Stain Studios;Deep Rock Galactic;Action;R$ 102,69;UPDATED FOR 2023My review is lengthy, so I'll preface my paragraphs with a TL.DR:1. Can I have fun on Day 1? Yes. Jump right in. From Haz 1 to Haz 4 you can succeed with no upgrades or leveling.Just use good teamwork.2. How's the shooting?Most excellent. Some of the most satisfying gunplay I've experienced in years as a shooter-game guy.3.Difficulty?Fair and skill-based. You won't be out-leveling your foes with raw stats here. Aim well and PAY ATTENTION to your environment.4.Classes?Well balanced and uniquely fun.5.World?Incredibly varied and gorgeous. You'll need to learn a bit of platforming to figure out your next jump. Do it quickly, the horde approaches!6. Enemies? As varied as the environments. All dangerous. All fun to shoot. 7. Missions? Enough to keep things interesting and challenging in their own right. 8. Levels, upgrades, grind, and endgame?Leveling is decently fast, and you unlock the fun stuff at a respectable pace as well.You'll acquire everything you want at a decent pace that rewards you adequately for your time. Endgame missions (Deep Dives) are a fun test of personal prowess and your skills as a team!Even after acquiring everything, they remain a fun test of your dwarven moxxy.There is an element of randomness to acquiring the coveted overclocks these missions grant, which can be vexing due to the large loot pool. The devs have implemented other ways to acquire them, and this issue of acquisition has been acknowledged. I don't believe these systems hurt the overall fun of DRG though. As for ways to spend your money further - there's a refreshing lack of GACHA and FOMO involved. There IS a Season Pass system, but it's entirely free, and what you don't unlock (you have several months to do it by filling a big XP bar) gets added to the random loot pool for you to acquire on your own time.Now then, on to my big sales pitch...What I love about Deep Rock Galactic is that this game lacks a lot of the trifling, tedious things most modern games like to throw at you. This isn't an endless quest of RNG loot grinding a la Borderlands. You can pick up and play this without fretting that you're missing out on a full season of shallow rewards, cash shop exclusives, and time limited gear that is only relevant for that month's balance patch.Day 1 presents you with four unique classes which all play differently, with unique guns and terrain traversal tools which synergize between each other to help you mine, dig, and hunt down your objectives. Yes, there is leveling, resource gathering, and upgrades in the form of loadout upgrades and dwarf perks. However, the quest to these is a steady, well paced adventure that encourages you to journey inside ALL biomes, each of which present unique obstacles to traverse. From Hazard 1 (easiest difficulty) to Hazard 4 (highest before unlocking Hazard 5) you can succeed with no perks, upgrades, or even an hour spent on any one dwarf. All you need is situational awareness, a non-toxic attitude, (really, the playerbase is great!) and good shooting.Which brings me to the most important thing - The gunplay is excellent! Every weapon feels and sounds good. You're often asked to aim not just straight ahead, but up, down, at every wall, even the empty air. The enemy is everywhere, and it is endless. A continuous, remorseless horde of jaws and fangs that come from nowhere, in forms as varied as the eerie, sodden, frigid, hellish, and irradiated landscapes you will struggle through to reach either the mission's end - or your own. It can't be understated how integral the terrain is to gameplay. These aren't just randomly generated tunnels with some dips and ledges to make things a little more interesting. The formulae at which terrain is generated spawns places both beautiful yet also steeply treacherous and labyrinthine. You'll need your wits to safely navigate these, and bravery when the swarm descends. You aren't just shooting your way out, you're thinking on your feet as you platform over gaping chasms and vault yourself over erupting fire pits, the horde behind you immolated on the spot where you just were by a magma jet. It's gripping. It's tense... But the pacing is kind enough to offer you enough quiet moments to appreciate the glowing grandeur of towering crystals and glittering salt spires you may freely climb. Best part is it's all destructible. Dig it out into a defensive trench. Drill yourself an escape tunnel to reach a lost friend. Bait your enemies into a meadow of explosive fungus flowers... Or fall to your death down a very, very deep hole. There's a lot of possibilities under planet Hoxxes that require you to adapt quickly and think on your feet with the tools and guns provided to you. Customization is fun. There's an in-game shop with NO microtransactions whatsoever. You spend the gold you earn and the resources you've mined to buy yourself new beards, armor suits, and even skin colors. Along the way the game will also reward you with shinies to uncover in the environments themselves. Cargo Crates to uncover weapon skins, lost helmets with coordinates to backpacks holding armor skins or cosmetic pickaxe parts. You aren't charged an extra dime for any of this. Only a bit of your time and courage. There are DLC packs that are purely cosmetic, and the soundtracks are quite good too! These don't impact gameplay and are just to support the devs!The endgame isn't especially hard to arrive at, but it does require you practice the good habits you've learned along the way. Team work, efficient terrain traversal, and good aim, in a series of longer missions full of double-objectives and heightened enemy spawns. The rewards are Overclocks. Perks ranging from mundane and convenient to lopsided and peculiar. These will either do boring things like increase your ammo - or make your glowing line of plasma spin around like crazy and cut up everything in front of you. They're fun but unnecessary. My advice? Don't treat the endgame like a grind to slog through. Don't look at your upgrades and cosmetics as a checklist. Take the Season as something to nibble on instead of power up.Experience the adventure. Revel in the solid core mechanics which make this an excellent shooter to dive into. Appreciate Deep Rock Galactic for what it is - an honest reprieve from a game genre filled with unrewarding tedium made to wring you of your dollars.;Recommended;1,037.3;11/04/2020;497;8
Coffee Stain Studios;Deep Rock Galactic;Action;R$ 102,69;In a world full of cash-grab AAA titles and half-baked indie ideas, Deep Rock Galactic exemplifies what can happen when a group of talented and passionate people come together and decide to redefine the industry standard of multiplayer co-op shooters.There is a...heart to this game, and its developers, that becomes immediately apparent once you've spent any amount of time in their universe. A fair amount of collectibles exist merely to be brewed into beer, most of which provide no function beyond being silly and entertaining. Management yells at you to stop kicking around (achievement-related) barrels while in the pre-game lobby. After failing a mission, you respawn in a hospital gown and can choose to embark upon the next mission in that getup instead of your usual colorful raiment. The choice is yours as to whether you pet docile, loot-containing bugs...blow them up...or both! There is a button specifically for yelling nonsensical and camaraderie-inducing voice lines.Beyond all of this lies a surprisingly well-balanced framework for your experience in-game that can be tweaked in a multitude of different ways, catering both to those who enjoy a more casual cooperative experience, as well as those who have a deep-seated masochistic streak! With hundreds of hours' worth of functional content to unlock - and even more cosmetics - this is one of the few titles I would deem truly special, and worth just about everyone's time.If you've friends that play? Hop in, grab a beer both IRL and in-game, and you'll have the time of your life. If you don't, well, DRG's community is one of the most wholesome and entertaining that I've experienced in decades of online gaming.;Recommended;892.9;20/10/2022;911;12

Coffee Stain Studios;Sanctum 2;Action, Indie, Strategy;R$ 46,99;One could call this a reimagining of the original Sanctums run and gun tower defense gameplay.  For those who played the original changes include enemies that actively attack you if you get too close, walls are now low enough for towers to be able to shoot across multiple rows and also make it harder for you to avoid attacks. Most towers are air and ground now. Weapons are now split into classes, and you can only carry four tower types so as to encourage team-work.           For new players and beginners, if you enjoy FPS combat and Tower Defense, then this is a great fusion of the two. Balance is perfect between towers and player weapons so as to ensure contribution from both. You also have the option of inviting three other friends for a chaotic good time of setting up towers and shooting monsters in the face.;Recommended;25.6;2/07/2013;92;N/I

Coffee Stain Studios;Goat Simulator;Casual, Indie, Simulation;R$ 14,26;All my life I have been empty. The doctors could not tell me why I was so depressed, and I never knew myself until today. I needed to experience my life as a goat. Goat Simulator has filled the void in my life.I knew as soon as I hit the truck with my goat that this was what I had been missing. I flew through the air in slow motion, tongue flying around, hitting the edge of the map and rebounding back, landing on (and falling through) the roof of a house. I could not get out, but that did not matter. I was treated with the ability to look down into the house beneath me, seeing the unsuspecting people casually sitting at their computers, oblivious to the sheer terror of the goat above them.Whether it was playing football with a basketball, swinging lampposts into groups of people or even doing 1080 degree flips, there was no limit to life as a goat. I didn't think it could get any better than this.I was wrong.As I jumped and screamed my way around the map, leaving a path of destruction in my wake, I happened upon a golden statue. Curiosity overtook me and I resisted the urge to grab it no longer. My life as a goat changed completely. I had a jetpack.I knew that this was meant to be, and what my mission from the Great Coffee Stain in the sky was. I was granted the supergoat power of being able to lift people and cars with my tongue. I could survive any impact. I could slow down time with mere thought. Now I could fly. It was time for world domination. Humanity had to be silenced so that the new goat overlords could reign supreme.All the humans are dead or enslaved. I have won. I am the goat, the goat is me.Go and goat this game. I kid you not, for mere bucks you can experience a sandbox like no other. Destruction, mayhem, death defying stunts. Seriously, there are more than 921 million goats in the world. Killing the humans was just part of the game. This is a SIMULATOR. Do you understand? A SIMULATOR. This can happen. There are enough goats out there to enslave us and/or kill us. It is your duty as a human to get this game, so that you may truly know your enemy. An enemy people do not take seriously, an enemy that we know nothing about. Coffee Stain studios have granted us the insight into the true terrifying reality of the impending Goatpocalypse.

Coffee Stain Studios;Goat Simulator;Casual, Indie, Simulation;R$ 14,26;So I was deciding whether to do a serious review on Goat Simulator because I haven't seen one on Steam. so rather than join the bandwagon of unfunny jokey reviews for the game, I'll stick to my guns...Goat Simulator does exactly what it says on the tin. you play as a Goat, You cause havoc wherever you go. trashing, bashing, causing explosions, destroying houses, jumping on trampolines, basically anything you want. With plenty of interactive objects in the game, you can spend plenty of time wandering around never finding a dull moment. The graphics in goat simulator are really nice. They aren't on the levels of Evolve or something, but for this type of game, you aren't really going to be playing for the top of the range graphics.  The music and audio are exactly what you would expect here. derpy music in the background as you potter about the city, along with cries of fear from the civilians as the demon goat runs rampant.There are three different areas in Goat Simulator. each zone is huge, ranging from theme parks, to crop fields, every building has something to do in it, every room has something to interact with or destroy. I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with either of the levels included here.  There is nothing difficult in the game to do here at all. There are no real objectives, just an open world sandbox game where you do whatever you want, whenever you want. I have managed to put about twenty hours into Goat Simulator. most of this time was playing on local screen co-op with my girlfriend, and then a couple more hours’ achievement hunting, and boy there is some pretty ridiculous achievements to do. Other than the developers openly coming out stating that they would not be fixing any bugs in the game, I had no real game breaking bugs, apart from sometimes falling through the world. however this was fixed easily by just respawning again. If you want a game that is just purely for messing around in with no real aim and wanting some real stupidity, then Goat Simulator will give you plenty of fun. granted this type of game is not for everyone, I enjoyed it though.

Coffee Stain Studios;A Story About My Uncle;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 46,99;A Story About My Uncle is a narrative focused, first person platforming adventure developed by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Studios. The game has great sound and music design, surreal environments, jaw-dropping visuals, and much, much more.The story not only puts emphasis on the main plot and characters, but also on the side plot and side characters. You play as a dad telling his daughter a story about how his uncle, Fred, goes missing and how the dad goes after him. The father comes across his uncles' invention, a suit which has a grappling hook and lets you take no fall damage, to help the dad find his uncle. On your journey you will traverse through a multitude of different environments, while meeting numerous side characters that will help you on your way. The narrative is the soul of the game, but it's done in a simple and subtle manner that you, the player, have to explore and ultimately piece it all together.The game focuses on movement, speed, freedom, and light puzzle solving instead of violence. Movement is the core element of the game. With the help of your grappling hook, you feel so free and fast. flying without restrictions and at uncontrollable speeds. It feels so genuine and fluid that it immerses you into this unique world. WASD moves your character, shift to sprint, LMB to use your grappling hook, Space to jump, hold RMB to power jump, and Shift and hold RMB for powerleap. Almost every new platform is a checkpoint where it gives you a certain amount of charges for your grappling hook. And then you have to use your charges and your skills wisely to get to the next checkpoint. Also, Later in the game you get rocket boots to help you through the harder parts of the game.Like I said before, the graphics are very stunning. ASAMU runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and by god this game looks fantastic. It has gorgeous lighting effects, great world design, phenomenal texture work, and a fantastic attention to detail. Also the art style is very vibrant and dark at the same time. using greens, blues, and browns to convey the mood of the game. Sadly, character models are pretty outdated.The sound and music design is absolutely brilliant. The sound is very immersive and completely engages the player into the game itself. The "Whoosh" that you hear when you soar through the massive levels is incredible and gives the player a huge adrenaline rush. The game exhibits an emotional, heart-felt, and melancholy symphonic, fantasy soundtrack. Voice acting is somewhat good and somewhat bad. The protagonist, the daughter, and the town elder are voiced well, while everyone else is poorly voiced.Additional Notes: This game has an FOV slider that can be adjusted from 60-120 FOV. There are 15 Steam achievements and the game is about 5-7 hrs. (depending on playstyle) and has a time trial mode. The game also features gorgeous water effects, best looking vegetation I've ever seen, beautiful architecture/ cityscapes, and stunning rock designs and textures. The devs are SO nice and are on the forums to answer questions and complaints!Final Thoughts: A Story About My Uncle is Gone North Games' very first game and it is a masterpiece with phenomenal sound, music, atmosphere, immersion, graphics, gameplay, and a gorgeous world to explore. However, the game does suffer from character models that are not up-to-date, ok voice acting, and a poorly translated script. Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive first person adventure with an unique world and tale to tell. And is most definitely worth $12.99.*Review copy was provided by Gone North Games. Thank you very much!*;Recommended;7.6;26/05/2014;217;N/I

Coffee Stain Studios;A Story About My Uncle;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 46,99;About 	First off, a general point. This is a first person adventure platformer with an amazing storyline that fits along perfectly with the environment and overall atmosphere. The amazing parkour present will give you a rush that never ceases to excite. Not to mention the astonishing scenery- it's on par with Bioshock Infinite. The hidden puzzles are awesome, and it is always a thrill to find them. 	Gathering gadgets and tools to get around a lot easier and have a blast doing it! Meet new creatures in a new world and discover the amazing secrets they hold, and find out the truth about your uncle. Pros & Cons ++ Pros + Great Graphics+ Easy to control+ Controller support+ Puzzles are fair+ Amazing ideas for character models+ Outstanding story line-- Cons - Character's have sketchy movements ( sometimes )- Relatively short for the price  (2 hour example)- Too dark in certain places- Cost of game ( $12.99 )- No Co-op Summary  -Spoiler Warning- 	                   V                           VYou play as a person looking for "The Uncle" that has been gone for a long time. While you search for him, you discover that he has been studying things- things impossible in this world. Not only that, but you later find that he has a way into this mystical world. The Uncle has been studying this world for a long time, as is shown through the large collection of notebooks with extensive drawings on the creatures of this world, along with strange markings in the pages. Through his discoveries, you are able to take the passage into this world to try and track him down. While you search, you find clues and leftover inventions that he could not carry with him on his journey. These inventions are normally just fun new ways of getting from A to B. After a while, you discover a village filled with some kind of frog people, who praise The Uncle, and are very kind to you. They assist you in your quest to the best of their amphibious abilities. You traverse many obstacles and solve numerous puzzles to try and figure out where The Uncle might be, but you soon learn that nobody- not even the frog people- know where he is. After continuing your grueling search, you finally find him, and receive an explanation about why he left your world for this one, and why the frog people praise him- He was not simply a traveler that they deemed praiseworthy, he was in fact their creator, and even the creator of the entire world. After this explanation, you try to get The Uncle to come home with you- however, he decides to stay with his creations, instead of returning to his home. On this somber note, you leave him to his life, and return back to your home to tell of what transpired. Personal opinion I.	Love. This. Game. I have already beaten it once in under 2 and a half hours, but I plan to go back and play it again, both for secrets I missed, and foreshadowing I might not have noticed my first time around. This game gripped me like a vice with its captivating visuals and wonderful story- I really want to see more games with this much creativity. This game has a lot of charm to it, a good bit of peace, and a *shocking* lack of any rage for a first person platformer- it's very fair and lenient compared to others of its genre. It's an overall tranquil experience, but it is not without suspense for what will happen next. If you are a person who enjoys richly atmospheric games over intense action, this is the perfect fit for you. My main gripe with this game is the price: $12.99 USD for a very short game is a bit steep. While the gameplay is fun and the story is rich, the experience was similar to eating a delicious slice of pie (or cake, but as we all know, the cake is farcical)- it is great while it lasts, but at the end, you feel like there was a lot more than what you were given, and you ache to have just a bit more. I hope my opinion has helped you decide whether or not to purchase this game. Final recommendation: If you are a story and parkour fan, pick it up whenever, but for others, wait until it goes on sale. When it goes on sale you have no excuse not to buy it. No excuse. None. I hope I helped you all on your decision about getting this game. I 100% recommend this game!! 9.5/10  Proofread by Frey Cloudseer  If you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!;Recommended;4.8;9/09/2015;166;9
Coffee Stain Studios;A Story About My Uncle;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 46,99;[Edit: Maybe I just suck at 3D platformers more than I realized.  So keep my warnings of "difficulty" in perspective.  If you're decent at 3D platformers, you'll be fine.  I don't want to scare anybody away from a great game.  Anyway, on with the review.]It's possible this was the most difficult game I've ever completed-- with more deaths than I care to contemplate. [Update: okay, I probably died more in Ori.]  Of my listed 18.4 hours, I'm sure there was some idling there-- but not more than a few hours.  I also like to explore, enjoy the beautiful scenery, and take things slowly.  I never claim to be super-skilled at 3D-platformers, but this really stretched my abilities.  It was easier for me once I switched from a controller to keyboard+mouse, but I'm not much of a console/controller person.  Thank God the devs toned down a notoriously difficult section. I'm not sure I would have made it.  But the important part is that I persevered because I loved the game:  it had charm, a good story, superb graphics, and usually fun gameplay when I wasn't on the verge of a rage-quit.  .-)  There's really nothing like flying through the air like Spiderman with a jetpack.  You really have to try it.Some folks probably won't find it overly challenging and kudos to you-- but don't be surprised if it takes some real work and repetition-- I'm not sure why this game is put in the "Casual" genre.  Some of the difficulty can be alleviated at times by finding an optimal/alternate solution.  So if you find yourself stuck, look for an alternative approach instead of assuming the game is broken, unfair, or just poorly designed.  It's not-- it's probably you.If you're looking for cheap achievements-- look elsewhere.  They are all actual *achievements* in the true sense of the word-- and I earned none of them...and that's okay with me.  I'll let the whizzes take on those challenges.Other than the occasional clipping issue, I only encountered one bug (which actually made one section of the game slightly easier as it turns out).  So all-in-all an excellent effort from Gone North Games-- let's support them and hope they make more!;Recommended;18.4;9/02/2015;110;2

Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;The devs said they designed this game for 80-100 hours of playtime, so I guess it's a bit more fun than intended.;Recommended;2,554.2;17/04/2021;981;624
Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;If you like Left 4 Dead style co-op, that's good. This game has similarities. The melee is much cleaner than Left 4 Dead 2 and where this game shines. The ranged combat certainly works but the emphasis is placed on your ability to balance out the hard hitting ranged with the melee weapons that go wide (long sword) or go deep (spear or axe), combined with the unique skills and abilities of the characters make this game quite fun.The voicelines, level design, hidden items, and scaling difficulty are icing on the cake. Most of the combat content is included, but a few powerful careers are locked behind DLC. There are also some DLC maps locked up, but if your host has the maps, you can play them without issues.The loot variety is mostly a 'power level' just to scale to higher difficulty and has less impact than perhaps it could. Weapon styles do make a difference and high level gear does often have traits that increase their utility to the team or have interesting effects such as generating ammo for a headshot, potions partially healing your friends, or reducing stamina loss when blocking hits.Overall, a very fun game that has remained fun for a long time. Shines with players, but beware of the whiny brats that run ahead leaving everyone behind. These people will sprint forward for some reason, not enjoy the ride, then get ragey when they end up getting picked off, blaming everyone else but themselves in a co-operative, team-oriented game. Don't lone wolf, be a team player, especially if there are some new players along the way. Usually the community is good though, these folks have found some other game to torment themselves in.;Recommended;117.0;3/11/2022;309;10

Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;Game is about killing rats, making friends, occasionally blowing up your friends, and collecting shiny things for your tower-home.Has many different flavours of rat such as: armoured rat, big rat, bigger rat, sneaky rat, ratatat-rat, stinky rat, and swarm rat. Sometimes you also fight Chaos or Beastmen who come with their own variety of smelly mooks.Unfortunately cannot play as rat.Can however play as not-rat of average height, tall annoying not-rat with pointy ears, and child-sized hairy not-rat. Each not-rat has four (fire not-rat only has three) flavours of rat-killing, including but not limited to: Shoot gun, shoot bow, shoot crossbow, shoot FIRE (but fire also hurt self because skill issue), and utilise metal sticks of bashing, slashing, pointy end stabbing to your heart's content.The vast majority of the community is very friendly and happy to help you on your journey. You may however, rarely, find a nerd or two who inbetween their laboured and slightly concerning mouth-breathing will insult you and/or your mother, father, sister, brother, neighbour, and anyone who has ever come into physical, digital, or spiritual contact with you.Thankfully you can just leave those capital 'G' Gamers™, and join a different lobby that is happy to welcome you into their party.The game has a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling, meaning it's accessible to anyone who wants to shoot-smash-singe-stab rats of varying sizes, while also having a steady climb of player skill and gear progression for those who want to shoot-smash-singe-stab more efficiently.You have several difficulty levels and other ways to adjust your rate of hurting rats or being hurt by said rats, so no matter your skill-level you can always have a good time. As you play the game you will level up your chosen not-rat, and unlock shiny pieces of equipment for your character(s) which will let you customise your playstyle to your liking and let you hit rats harder.Be excellent to each other, chat pure umgak with your friends, have fun, and most importantly: kill rats.;Recommended;65.5;26/05/2023;226;95
Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;A great game with a great future Honestly I played this game too much to not recommend it. The combat is great, the maps are fun and the community is really friendly (I had maybe two toxic people in my time playing). So am I recommending this game? Yes of course, this is the greatest bang for my buck in my steam library, but I don't know if you can stick with this game for long. If you find the combat to be fun and want to see everything there is in this game you can spend like 120 hours to do all things which I would recommend doing, if it's really fun you can play this game for well over a thousand hours (I'm still not finished with everything). If it doesn't click with you in the first few hours, just refund it. Still I think everyone should at least try it, if a first person diablo set in the Warhhamer Fantasy universe sounds appealing to you: this is your dream come true. If you're not sure about it I will say this: try it and when you're happy with it stay for a few months and then run! You don't want to be around for as long as I am. So now let's get into the actual review part.  Why am I still here? So to start I think it's important to know where my opinon of this game comes from, I remember when the first one came out, I was initially interested but didn't buy till I had already put around 500 hours into the second game, so I'm not a veteran of the series by any means. I played both games and overall I think the second is better. When I bought this game on launch I was actually still playing with two friends, it was supposed to be gap filler for when Monster Hunter Worrld came out, but then I liked this game much more and played it for the next few months and suddenly the game was celebrating it's first anniversary, I would say this was the best time to be a fan of Vermintide 2. Then Winds of Magic hit, I was among many of the early beta players. I won't say that I think the game got worse after this expansion, by any means right now it's the best it's ever been, but something changed and I will tell you what changed later: For now I will recommend this game again. Right now you probably get the most fun with it, since there are now 15 maps and not just the twelve of the main game.  The Game Vermintide 2 is first person hack and slash set in the Warhammer Fantasy Universe. Further it's set during the End Times, so as always in this lovely universe: everything is ♥♥♥♥, ohh and the world is ending, but not to worry Lohner has a plan. Lohner is an innkeeper in the small town of Übersreik (the birthplace of SIGMAR) and throughout the first game we somewhat save the city with his help: We are Victor Saltzpyre, Markus Kruber, Sienna Fuegonasus, Bardin Gorekson and the noisy elf. In the second game our band of heroes has left the small town of Übersreik (or better said has been captured) and made it's way towards the mountain fort of Helmgart. There the Skavenclan Fester has allied with the Rotblood Tribe of the norscan Chaosworshippers, it's now our objective to destroy their armies, leaders and equipment. And while we're at it: we also travel to the Castle of Drachenfels, where yet another Aids... uhm I mean Chaossorcerer is threatening the area. So as you can tell, this game has a story, which in my opinion is one of the many reasons this coop-game is superior to many of its competitors. Four out of the Five characters are exremely likeable, they're all well developed and have nice banter with each other. Fortune brought them together and it shows. Even though they insult each other a lot the contrary is true, they need each more than they know and it shows. I would recommend this game for the characters alone, but again there's also the actual gameplay.  The good The gameplay is incredible in this game, it's a fully fleshed out combat system with many miniscule details you will learn while playing. The skillceiling is near endless and you can always get better, if this appeals to you, I again recommend buying it. Starting out you will play one of five characters, while you play you gradually unlock careers for each character, in total you can unlock 15 careers. All of them are similiar yet on the higher difficulties they will work different depending on which task you have to fulfil in a given career. Each character has his/her own set of weapons, all the weapons are good, there is  no s tier, they are all viable. So again this is a lot you can do and on top of that there are different tier for each weapon, grey being the worst, then green, then blue, then orange and then red. You get weapons by completing a level and getting a loot box, if you collect items on the map which make the game harder you will get a better loot box at the  end and therefore better loot, problem being, this is very random. The weaves system is better (but we don't talk about that). The main core of the combat is pushing, blocking and dodging while slashing at hordes of enemies. The enemies are all varied, there are as of now: Skaven, Chaos and Beastmen. Each Faction has a unique miniboss which you will encounter (Skaven and Chaos have two I know). There are also specials which you should snipe because they're are really dangerous and then there are elite enemies for each faction: Blackrats with spears and shields for Skaven and Chaos Warriors and Marauder for the Rotbloods (we don't talk about Beastmen). Add to that five Boss maps, there you can beat the Rotblood tribeleaders, the greyseer of Clan Fester, the Warlord of the Skaven and a Chaossorcerer. These maps are normal maps with the same gameplay, however there end event is a boss fight, if you bring the right careers these can be really easy, if not they will be a fair challenge. Again if this sounds good to you, then buy the game, it's on sale very frequently and even the normal price is pretty fair.  The Bad So I'm not reluctant to recommend this game, I think it's good and everyone should try it, however: If you want to stay here for as long as me, you should go. This is not elitism, the developers of this game are just really bad at handling it and it hurts. New content is handled really poorly in this game, I've been saying it for a few months now: this game isn't dead, it's being starved. There are night maps in this game, but the only time you'll see them is around halloween, there are actually 16 free maps, but one you'll only see during the anniversary, I find this to be harmful to the game as a whole and not really something special to celebrate. The latest free content for this game were three new maps, they're are among the best maps in the whole series and they are my only hope that this game will become better. This also ties into dlc management, the biggest dlc (and the one which had a beta) was a disaster and it's incredible that this game is still alive, in other words this really shows how good the actual gameplay is. They don't do big dlc anymore, now you can buy cosmetics, which seems to work for them. I hope that in a few months I can come back here and delete these sentences, but as of today I will not. We might also get one new career this year but if we're being honest this is not enough content. Here's hope they add more maps and finally release the content they already have, if not I don't think this game is gonna last the three or five more years they are aiming for.  Edit 1  It's been two freaking days since I wrote this review and it's already outdated, I will now fullyrecommend this game for a few reasons: 1. They announced an update for june 23 2020, this will feature new weather effects, this makes the game more replayable. 2. The new career is coming on june 23rd, this is much sooner than anticipated and gives me hope, that we will actually get two careers this year.If you have any  more questions feel free to ask me here or as pm.

Fatshark;Warhammer: Vermintide 2;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;The game is incredible. I've played it since before launch. It has unparalleled melee combat that is impactful and satisfying. There are a bunch of weapons and classes and all feel unique. The maps are fun and challenging. No two runs are ever the same even on the same map thanks to the AI director. Things can be going great one second and you've wiped the next, but only if you aren't paying attention. The skill ceiling is incredibly high and even with all my hours I am nowhere near as good as the best players. And that's fine, because you don't need to be a great player to enjoy the game. Another highlight is the voice acting. Top notch all around. Being that the game is relatively small, I also found a great core group of friends. The game is much better when played with friends. I cannot recommend this game enough. Buy it, slay rats, and have a good time.;Recommended;3,030.9;19/04/2021;220;4

Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;(old review, might be outated in some cases - be aware...)Is it good? -YESIs it good for everyone?-NO... - depends!Why?...well it's a good mixture of: - L4D game mechanics (4 players vs AI with those special enemies, swarming hordes, but no PVP)- Chivalry: Medieval Warfare melee combat style with charged attacks, parry and dodge- Kinda pure ranged combat is possible with mage class, limited ranged capabilities due to ammo with others (might change with good loot luck)Features atm:- Good graphics (GTX770, i5-4x4.2ghz, 16gig RAM here playing smoothly on high settings – and I know folks that run the game on a first gen i7-860 with a gtx460 on low but are able to play ok'ish)- Responsive and smooth game engine if the hosting player is in the same region and has a decent connection (play with friends!)- Nice and atmospheric maps so far- Random map events you need to deal with keeping the same map re playable (as there where only 3 later 4 maps in beta)- On the run adjustable difficulty (Grimoires to pick up or not - more loot but group debuffs)-Team play is key – all loot improving items are shared at the end of the round no matter who carries them home!Stuff to be aware before buying this game:- The game play features getting permanently swarmed, little room to breathe or mistakes, it's hard survival after all even on normal difficulty. this is not a game to chill out and snipe some AI's off on a cake walk... no no no it is not!- Playing the game public may be kinda frustrating due to some players still have no clue what to do at all, run off and get killed quickly so having friends playing the game is a big difference to difficulty and success in general. You should join/form a group/clan in the long run or just be fine with those random dudes in public games – it's not impossible to master higher difficulties in public games but it's less likely for sure in WH:Vermintide.- 1st person melee combat may not be liked by everyone - but I was surprised how many of my friends who disliked the combat in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare now enjoy this game as it is PvE not PvP. A big difference!- hard difficulty means HARD DIFFICULTY atm, epic and legendary loot tiers require high game difficulties to get any chance at all rolling them ... you need a team of capable FPS/Chivalry players to proceed to those nice and shiny loot things! (I hope it stays this way... good loot should always be a challenge to get not only a matter play time and pure grind)- "head bobbing" can't be turned off yet so ppl with motion/simulation sickness be aware of this (or avoid 2H-weapons to minimize the shaking effect)- No color blind mode yet- Just one master volume slider meaning loud music all the time or low game volume... I got used to it but meh- No dedi servers yet (but promised)- Once again: playing public games is not ideal as some ppl (as like in any game) may not care about team play that much or have (yet) no clue how to react to certain events - I recommend to play it with friends or to quickly make friends with good players along your runs to master that learning curve together! Individual player skill is one thing, to form a successful permanent team needs time but it's very rewarding.- The loot system is very very random atm. If you're unlucky you won't get a good item for your preferred class after days of game time.State of game development: -The game has still some flaws with stability that might need treatment by the user...for e.g.: GTX680/GTX770 users might need to down clock their GPU by 40mhz with nvidiainspector.exe to avoid crashes (common problem in a lot of games these days...)-The game does not feel finished and polished balance and hit box wise, but it's playable - good luck finding another good COOP vs AI game those days so it's ok for me :)- The game Devs seem to care and fix stuff kinda quickly - so that's promising for existing and future issues.To sum it up:This game is an awesome TEAM CHALLENGE!L4D and L4D2 PvE are a cake walk compared to this.Like it or not, you will first fail, then hopefully learn, group up, maybe give up (!) or succeed through higher tiers of swarming PvE COOP madness!Or you don't care about good loot, (get drunk) play it on easy with friends and have a good time for some hours - totally fine too .) ===*edit  2015-10-26th :Situation in public games has slightly improved since more and more ppl are kinda experienced and the Devs set the in game VoIP to “ON” by default so others can at least hear you talk to them.I'm still missing some tactical shout outs like in Killing Floor or Insurgency like “follow me!”, take cover here!” (best with 3D marker) etc. to improve basic and quick communication.The random special enemy spawns make any run on any difficulty very unpredictable as you might encounter a Rat Ogre plus a Scaven swarm plus 2-3 special enemies at once! I have to say I like this randomness because if you master that … that's just awesome!On the other hand this means any run “only” on hard difficulty with 4 experienced mates in Teamspeak can end in a disastrous wipe – you never know!However, this is quite rare on lower difficulties so plz don't nerf this too hard... it keeps the same map tense like any small village you enter in DayZ - like you never know what's waiting for you around the next corner. A possible adrenalin rush and that feeling on a successful comeback - not many games aside from close competitive league games may trigger this on me:)Some helpful links and tips for beginners to break that hard learning curve:- Tome and Grimoire locations: http://www.vermintidedb.com/missions.php- Tutorials on the official forums: http://forums.fatsharkgames.com/categories/tutorials- New player advice on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/3oujwq/new_player_advice_thread_odoom/If you start the game for the first time you should set your FOV to 90 (*read edit down below) and the “Player Outlines” to “always on” so you won't be hitting the dwarf and elf all the time like I did in the fist hours of game cause you may confuse them with Scavens … no offense .)Also I recommend to rebind “Target” from “T” to “F” or something as marking special enemies and equipment is very helpful and the T-key feels to be too far off as you should need it a lot. Also enable/bind push to talk for public games and you may increase the gamma by a good bid to see what's lurking in all those dark corners waiting to back stab you... Many thanks for your nice replies guys – have fun slaying those rats!=====> * update 2017 (well, better late the never...)Consider this when changing FOV - haven't tested it but sounds legit:"Schwartzy 18 Apr, 2016 @ 10:45pmThe FOV setting in this game is for vertical FOV instead of the more commonly used horizontal FOV. So a vertical FOV of 90 is like 120 horizontal. Strangely it doesn't cause any fish-eye effect even though in other games a setting of 120 FOV usually would cause some so it's hard to tell that something's off, except you'll notice the rats hitting you from very far away with their melee attacks (and vice versa) which certainly doesn't feel right.So the actual setting for a horizontal 90 FOV should be around 60. You can bump it to like 65 FOV to make it a little wider but the higher you go the more the melee attacks will appear out of range."===Please consider that this game might have changed in some ways since I've posted this very review back then balance and perfornance wise .);Recommended;96.5;23/10/2015;1,202;71
Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;So after 2,634 hours of hunting rats, carrying tomes and inhaling poisonous green gas, I have still not written a review. And it is somewhat too late. There is probably no readership anymore since even this game's successor is years old by now. Many players have retired and I have too. enduring problems with my wrist made me prefer turn-based strategy. Otherwise I would still be roaming the streets, cellars, and squares of Ubersreik, and the depths below.There is just no experience comparable to the thrill, the immersion, the horrors and the triumph of a Vermintide run. Especially in a good team. In my years of playing Vermintide I have met the best, friendliest and most competent players you could ever imagine. This game had - and I'd assume still has - a fantastically creative, cooperative and supportive community, and there is a good variety of mods improving the experience in many ways.I've been playing all kinds of video games, for about 25 years now, and I can say with absolute confidence that Vermintide is the single best of them.;Recommended;2,859.0;10/04/2021;161;9
Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;I should have written this much earlier, but I was too busy playing this game I guess. I'm currently 379 hours in and played 50+ hours during the last two weeks. I'm in the middle of my exams as a vet student...Although I never was really interested in the Warhammer universe, mostly because the games that it featured weren't really my cup of tea, this game really sparked a flame. The setting is fascinating, the in total hours long dialog between the characters really tells the story of these 5 heroes, the rats look awesome and the maps breathe a great atmosphere. The gameplay is a melee focussed version of Left 4 Dead and feels very satisfying, it's easy to learn and has so much depth that I'm still looking in awe at those guys that are running the maps on the highest difficulty, without any bots or friends and with the worst weapons you can get.  On the topic of weapons: there is a great variety in weapons to pick from and your play style is highly customizable through 3 weapon traits and 3 personal trinkets. Vermintide also has an unoffical modding community, which in my opinion really improves the game, so certainly check that out. When you have enough of the story line maps, you can play against endless waves of rats in the "Last Stand" game mode (something I really enjoy a lot). And then finally: yes this game is still getting updated quite often.While I love this game, there are things that I think could be better. Compared to L4D2, the two game modes offer less variety and might get boring quicker than you expected. I did check however and it looks like I only have 144 hours in L4D2 and for Vermintide... well you can see my time played up here, which started counting since april 2017. What keeps people playing (and I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing), is partually due to the grind for better loot.  The modding community has added lots of improvements, so I don't see why the devs couldn't have added these things themselves yet (however I must say they improved the AI recently).Summary:(+) Brings the Warhammer universe and the ratmen alive, great cosmetic design and dialog that supports the lore(+) satisfying combat and gameplay mechanics, easy to learn and extremely hard to master(+) Great variety in weapons and playstyles(+) The modding community ads great improvements (although it's not officially supported and you need to download them from outside of steam)(+) Last stand game mode is great to add some variety if you are bored of the story mode maps(+) Devs regularily update the game and add new content(-) Quite a few maps, but only two game modes(-) There is a great element of grind, if you don't like that kind of stuff. I personally enjoy it.(-) The mods are great, but some of the mods add stuff that the devs should have really added themselves already.(-) New content is through paid DLC's (although some are free).

Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;At 525 hours, I finally feel competent to give a decent review of this game.First of all, you don't spend 525 hours playing something that sucks, so this is a thumbs UP review right off the bat.ParticularsSOLO PLAYYes, it's good as a solo game - but while you can have a lot of fun with it, you're seriously missing out on the core of the game's teamwork regarding the utility of other players and things that can be learned by sharing knowledge of gear, maps, tactics, playstyles, trinket combinations, buff uses, terrain quirks, and every other aspect of a game whose play area covers the equivalent of several square miles in several scenarios.  It's also fairly impossible to know how good (or bad) you really are until you have seen people better than you are carry a whole event by themselves, then rescue the rest of the party, then carry the scenario finale solo again, then politely tell you "gg"... or ruthlessly tear you up and down for your many, many deficiencies.Regarding Steam achievements, while you can complete every scenario in solo play (except finding the Trials of the Foolhardy. that simply requires four players to unlock), there's no such thing as getting even close to all of the achievements because several of them require events in different areas of the map to happen at the same time.MULTIPLAY COOPFirst of all, YES there is friendly fire - and it's not very friendly!  That said, it's not usually very bad, either.  New players will be infuriated by being hit in the back and spinning around to see what's behind them, only to be hit from the opposite direction by the rat your ally was aiming for.  Learning with friends and as a team will minimize this aspect of frustration, and is much better than PUG groups as a rule, but you can always meet some amazing players if you're willing to go out there and play in the open.  Privacy settings allow any player to do either, and open lobbies (for those who choose that setting) allow players to choose groups in the scenarios they desire to play.I've run the gamut of encounters with the community, from juvenile delinquents essentially performing a hit-and-run leet no-scope flameout because they are in it for the lulz (rare, in my encounters), to the adult, mature gamer who is willing to stick with you and take a couple of beatings just to carry the team through for new cata players.  It's a mixed bag, but usually it seems people just want to have fun.  Since there's no versus mode (other than getting drunk in the inn, and fistfighting for bruises - which is hilarious, since the characters curse at each other while doing it) there's very little rq or angst, other than someone abandoning a group.Coordinating a group to use various abilities and buffs is a big part of the game, since a healing focus character with appropriate trinkets (gear) can keep a whole party healed IF the rest of the party allows them to pick up healing packs and draughts - and a potion sharing character with a chance to not consume the potion can share it again (and again, and again...) if they have access.  Same with bombs.RANDOM/OTHERAs compared to L4D2 I find VT to have far superior melee options, which for me is the deciding factor in what makes the game better.  In many other regards, the specials, hordes, and Rat Ogre are all analogous to their counterparts and provide challenge based on their number, spawn and direction of approach, and of course, difficulty setting.Each character has a selection of weapons that are effective at range and up close, and each gear has between 0 (basic gear) and 3 (elite gear) traits that can be unlocked.  These include things like push without using stamina, projectiles split into two shots, and does more damage from behind, and there are a lot of good guides explaining the strengths and uses of good combinations.The only outstanding point regarding characters is that many noob players like the elf because she's basically artillery.  Word to the wise: learn a different starting character. you'll find more groups.  Anyone can learn the elf later because... well, she's basically artillery.Great job on this game, Fatshark - I look forward to VT2 in the future.;Recommended;598.3;31/08/2017;142;8

Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;Well what can I say? I've played over 1800 hours at this point and I'm still playing until Vermintide 2 is released.People compare this to left for dead and whilst it's it's similar it's so much more.It's the kind of game you could drop in and play casually with friends on the odd occasion and have a blast. It's also a game you can keep progressing at with ridiculously indepth mechanics that reward high level play.CONS :  The loot system is too random for my tastes and doesn't reward losing. So you can play the highest difficulty and lose a ton but someone who plays nightmare casually and wins a lot will end up a higher level. Level means nothing really.If you want to play with bots I suggest the QOL mod but they're still a bit derpy. If you're a good player you can happily carry the bots through the hardest difficulty on full book runs with a bit of baby sitting.PROS :Skill level is insane. You can progress from teamplay to playing the game solo as in without bots. The game mechanics are solid. The combat feels visceral and satisfying and rewards skill over "hold w and mash lmb" style play. There's a lot of nuance you won't pick up on until you practice yourself.Storywise it's done really well. There's no real "story" but the voicelines and banter between the characters really paints a picture and makes pertty much every run satisfying.It has a more mature community where a lot of people are willing to help you out with tips and guides. Avoid the steam forum for this game though as it's the same 10 idiots giving bad advice and trolling each other. Stick to r/vermintide.At launch the game was a bit of a train wreck from what I heard, I started playing a year after and I've been really impressed with it.The devs, fatshark are really cool and are tight with the community. Their DLC policy is top notch.If you play with someone who has the dlc you can play the map and get the weapon drops for free. If you want to host the maps yourself and get the completion banners and do DLC contracts you need to buy them. Really fair. They have skin dlc which is pretty much about supporting the devs and I've been more than happy to do that.So all in all I highly recommend this game for people looking for indepth game mechancis with skill based progression. You might want to hold off for V2 but since it's always cheap and on sale I can tell you from from playing the closed v2 beta myself, any skills you gain from playing this will be directly transferable.Buy game, kill rats, become a hero of Ubersreik!And yeah I'm going to use this to shill my twitch.tv/distance9 so come see me on vermintide 2 :);Recommended;1,900.8;13/02/2018;175;10

Fatshark;Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide;Action, Indie;R$ 88,99;It's been said before, (by Arch Warhammer, I believe), that Vermintide is the only good thing to come out of the Warhammer Fantasy Battles "End Times" lore. I can agree with that.I went in to Vermintide as something of a doubter, thinking, "How much fun could killing rats be?". As it happens, the Skaven are fantastic foes and Vermintide, while fairly straight forward, is a very good game.The Pros:-Combat is Meaty and Intense.-The Dialogue, both from the Skaven and Heros, is masterful: both in writing and delivery.-Learning how to play is nuanced and based in rhythm and skill, as well as map familiarity.-The Skaven are both comical and monsterous, with a sort of Lovecraftian overtone, providing satisfaction in their destruction.-The Hero Characters have distinct personalities and secrets, with many of those stories being suggested instead of explained plainly. Their interplay and banter is superb, delivering both lore and hinting at unusual personality traits. Furthmore, they're believable, with temperment changes based on circumstances- the normally boastful elf can be forced to plead for aid if downed, the normally polite Sergeant can become short-tempered if injured, etc. For a horde game, the characters are nuanced in a fashion that Bioware struggles for these days.-The visuals are excellent in a sort of Gothic Horror-Gone-Renaissance fashion. While not the most high resolution in texture, you won't likely have time to notice and performance is relatively clean and fluid.-The audio is good with solid musical scores and sound effects: you really feel that shield smacking skaven skull.-As of this date, (4/25/17), the game is largely bug free. There are some, still, however.-New In-Game Lore Book is a handy way to learn Warhammer Fantasy Lore and gives additional incentive to play.-DLC is either free or allows non-owner players to join DLC owners, which doesn't lead to a map bottleneck. DLC owners will still exclusively have access to DLC Bounties, weapons, and starting DLC map games. -Special Vermin force the players to mix up tactics.Cons:-Certain map features can hinder player movement, like cobblestones and debris sticking up. At best, this is an irritation. at worst, it can get you killed.-Occasional crashes, (fairly rare)-Skaven transitioning terrain, (climbing up over ledges, and such), do not react to croud control which can royally screw your team over, should said rats attack immediately upon standing up-Weapon stats are far more complicated that shown in-game, forcing the player to either find other sources of information, (i.e., YouTube), or discover by trial-and-error-Gameplay is heavily team oriented and there are a remarkable amount of garbage players. I guess you can't blame the game for this, but it is still a reality of Vermintide. -Player numbers are not amazingly high, so some hours will have player shortages, (like Weekday early mornings), while other times will have high numbers, (Weekends).-Only 2 gameplay modes and new weapons are the only real incentive for playing, limiting gameplay longevity.-No real class systems to enrich the game. just weapon types.-Skaven physics can glitch out. -Not worth the full price IMHO.-In-game voice-over-IP could use additional options.Note, while I have a large list of Cons, they are large in quantity, not quality. Would I recommend Vermintide? Yes, but primarily when on sale. With only two game modes and loot being the primary incentive to keep playing, the game can grow stale faster than most. Still, it's a unique experience and what is there is extremely well crafted.;Recommended;71.0;25/04/2017;115;1

Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;A lot of discussions have been going on about Krater. While some players praise the fresh rpg setting and the challenging quests, others critisize the imbalanced powers of the monsters.Here is what I experienced:Pros:- easy to get started, self-explanatory game mechanics, well-made learning curve- a solid story about abusing power, elite leaders and supressing the masses, set in a post-nuclear Sweden, with a good sense of humour- long-time motivation for those who love challenges, as there are perfect builds to find, the limbo (a 45-level-dungeon) to raid etc.- Nice graphic style, clean and fitting sounds and soundtrackCons:- Disastrous balancing: Some enemies are way too weak, others will bring your team down in no time. It takes a lot of time to find a good build for the final battle - but it does not depend on your own skill, but more on puzzling together different boosters (that improve strength, defense, stamina etc)- Boring quests, standard rpg loot & collect tasks- The coop mode is only three levels - well, for a game that calls itself a coop game, it's sparse, to put it mildlyIn the first ten hours of playing, I was about to tell friends to try out the game, as it had this fresh setting and things went on pretty well, absolving quests and looting dungeons. But then I was stuck more often due to strong enemies, no money to buy upgrades, and misspent boosters. The final battle got pretty frustrating as I did not find a build good enough to beat the final boss. Also, until today, I never found a single player in the coop lounge to join a game.Concerning that, I would not recommend to buy this game until one is going for a challenging rpg.;Not Recommended;31.6;19/06/2014;189;1
Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;Krater is a game which can neither be wholly dismissed nor whole-heartedly embraced. The tactical team-based RTS/ARPG hybrid battle-system is exciting, innovative, and well-implemented, while various tweaks to the typical ARPG formula show the thoughtfulness of passionate game design.  The graphic design is consistent and thematically appropriate throughout. Sadly, Krater plays like a concept demo - a few hours of fun as you acclimate to the control scheme and unique design elements, followed by a steep drop-off in variety. The crafting system is essentially a grinding-incentiviser, and character progression is bizarrely limited in ways which are obviously designed to conjure up more grindplay. While the four classes do allow for some interesting combinations and teamwork, each class has only two skills. Although these skills can be tweaked in a variety of ways thanks to the unique augmentation system, the actual gameplay is largely unaffected by these tweaks and runs together in a wash of habitual button-mashing. In many ways Krater succeeds - the writing is quirky, the world interesting, and the graphics stimulating. Unfortunately at the core of it all is an exceedingly repetitious experience. If your love for grinding or your desire to explore outweigh your distaste for repetitive gameplay, there is a unique and rewarding experience to discover here. Otherwise, avoid investing yourself in Krater: its innovation is only skin deep.;Not Recommended;4.6;4/03/2015;76;1

Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;Krater: Shadows over Solside is a Top-down, Action-RPG developed and published by fatshark – pushed out of the gate in late-Spring 2012. Its reception was largely mixed – due to bugs, unfinished content and a lack of any sort of co-op mode. But how does it hold up five years down the line?StoryThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Sweden after the ‘Untergang.’ You take control over a bunch of mercenaries looking to make their mark on this new world. Their misadventures take to us to Solside – which perilously hangs over the Krater – a seemingly endless abyss that draws those from all over to seek its riches and possibly their demise in the process.    GameplayKrater conspires to deliver a smooth and diverse gameplay experience using various Action-RPG mechanics as its base. What differentiates Krater is that you can control up to three mercenaries at once – providing the tools to micro-manage each member quickly and efficiently.At first, you start with only three mercenaries but you can recruit others at recruitment NPCs on your travels. Mercenaries can be lvl’d up and enhanced through implants, boosters, weapons and gadgets – which provide a host of different possibilities and interesting combinations to tinker and experiment with.  There are a total of four different classes – Bruiser, Regulator, Medikus & Slayer. Each class has a mutant variant which possess radically different models and skills. Mutant variants have to be recruited. There isn’t any way to transform your base class into its mutant variant or vice versa.  The game will propel you forward in the form of both primary and optional quests, slowly opening the large map up for exploration. There are many neat references through various dialogue and item descriptions that will hint at the world pre-apocalypse.CraftingCrafting in Krater does not sit passively in the background. Recipes – obtained from drops and various receptacles – will grant you the ability to create a host of weapons, implants, boosters and gadgets allowing you to negate much of the gold cost from buying items from NPCs outright. And gold can be scarce for much of the early to mid-game so crafting becomes invaluable. Graphics/EnvironmentThere are a large of number varying environments – which all conspire to immerse you in the post-apocalyptic setting – from bunkers, swamps, deserts, caves and more. There’s a lot here for the eye to see to keep things fresh.In-game graphical options are limited – offering a small range of customization. You will notice the occasional flickering texture here and there. It is noticeable but doesn’t occur often enough to cause an annoyance.Music/SoundKrater’s soundtrack is exceptional in its range in tonality to fit any given moment. You’ll often stop and just sit back to listen to its complexity and ambience. In addition to the sublime OST, you have crisp animation sounds and various spoken commentary given by each mercenary throughout your adventures. For example, if stationary for a period of time, that fact may be noted by a mercenary. There are many different scenarios that’ll prompt a host of comments. The cut scenes that divide chapters are also brilliantly voice acted. Co-OpThe online co-op portion was a later addition to the base game and comes in the form of three multi-lvl missions – which add new areas, bosses and a good way to get loot. It’s important to note, the standard campaign story cannot be played in co-op. While the added co-op missions themselves are fun. The net-code is quite buggy and crashes have been known to occur frequently. As of writing this, I strongly recommend playing the co-op missions only in solo-mode which can be done by hosting your own game. The reason for this is that there is a bug present that can reset your characters completely to their base configuration if the host of a co-op game crashes. The last boss in the co-op mission Electrified!, Electro Bert cannot be killed at this time, due to a crash that always occurs about a minute into the fight.DevelopmentKrater: Shadows over Solside was initially planned to be the first part of a three part saga. Because of its mixed reception, the two other parts were never completed. The end of the current game ends on a cliff-hanger and the story may never have a proper resolution.  AchievementsBecause of the crash that occurs in the Electrified! co-op mission, there is a single achievement that cannot be attained at this time. For those looking to accrue the other 40 achievements, you’re looking at around a playtime at the bare minimum of around 50-60 hours. ConclusionWe’ve just eclipsed Krater’s 5-year anniversary. Despite all of the updates and additions in that time-frame which have been few and far between throughout, what we have is a game that still garners very mixed sentiments from those that experience it. I feel that Krater: Shadows over Solside will be remembered as a game that could’ve been exceptional but fell short of the mark in the end.;Recommended;130.8;15/06/2012;73;1
Fatshark;Krater;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy;R$ 27,99;This is one of those "maybe" games but I'm erring to "Not Recommended" just so people are aware of the issues it has.Most obvious - it's clear they intended this game to be large or even multi-part story but that never happened so it doesn't feel like a completed thing as-is - that doesn't mean it's not fun at times, it just means it's not "all of a piece".I've had issues around alt-tab since Beta and they're STILL THERE even now.  Alt-tabbing will almost certainly leave the game in an immovable/hard-to-interact-with window - it may cause the game to just stop responding entirely - it's almost never a good idea to do it.Saving is limited - you always restart from the nearest quest hub - and I've lost progress after a hang/crash a few times - I've lost progress after exitting properly a few times too - add that to it's dislike of alt-tab and you have a recipe for frustration which has led to me stop playing more-than-once.Difficulty varies WILDLY - you'll spend a lot of time doing really easy stuff and then hit something REALLY hard - often just a random mob which is super-tough or whatever - it clearly needed more polishing.All of that is a real shame because I like the setting, music, voicework, concept, playstyle, itemisation - it had a tonne of potential and ever time I come back to it I enjoy it for a while before I hit yet another pothole/crash and quit again!tl.dr lovely idea about half polished/finished and just a bit too crashy to recommend as-is.;Not Recommended;7.0;9/12/2015;61;N/I

First, the postitives:+ post-apocalyptic, yet "fresh" setting (a krater in future Sweden)+ nice art style+ doesn't take itself too serious (also some nice pop-cultural references)+ very cool system to modify skills and chars (via boosts/implants)+ crafting system+ "meaty" crits and nice fx+ teleport to world map from everywhere+ good loot is scarce (a plus in my book)+ great name generatorNow the not-so-positives:- booooring dungeons (only a few tile sets and it gets repetitive fast), almost no interactive objects or surprises and only a few rare special bosses- much back-tracking if you want to explore the whole map- opponents are just static groups in regular intervals in the dungeons - not much tactic involved, more like button-smashing- chars aren't really unique (with the exception of the DLC chars), they are randomly assembled and you can hire them in many towns- chars have limited levels, which you can expand with money to a max of lvl 15 (which you can reach in maybe 2h per char), after that there is no char evolution other than gear/implantsThat being said, this game would have had huge potential. Better maps and more interesting battles would have helped much. It just feels too generic as is.Imo, the best thing would have been, if the game had had turn-based or rtwp-combat with a deeper skill system. I'm sure it would have been a  (indie) success with that.I'm giving this a thumbs-up, although the devs didn't realize the potential of the game. So far I have fun.

Fatshark;Hamilton's Great Adventure;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 32,99;After first few levels you have seen everything this game has to offer. Nothing really changes, the stages just get longer and more frustrating. The gameplay boils down to trial and error. Even one misstep will make reaching the goal impossible and you have to keep starting over until you memorize the path perfectly. Sometimes a failure isn't even your fault as enemies can break the path too, even if you tried to keep them at bay with the otherwise completely useless bird. (Local co-op, yeah right.)If this were just a calm, slow-paced puzzle game, I could have lived with that. But no, there are "timed" puzzles as well and they really irk my nerves. For example, there was this one stage in which you have to keep a snowball rolling so it will eventually reach a button which opens the gate to the exit. You have to keep opening gates and eliminating enemies from its path, but over half of the time you can't even see, where the snowball is going, no matter how you try to turn the camera. So besides learning the right path, you have to have almost pixel-perfect timing too.Utterly boring game with unlikable characters and a story that nobody cares for. I paid about 1€ for this and still I think I got ripped off. Not recommended for anyone.;Not Recommended;16.7;31/12/2013;82;6
Fatshark;Hamilton's Great Adventure;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 32,99;I'm not sure whether to call this a puzzle game or not. All you have to do is to get to the goal, hitting switches, dodging environmental hazards and the occasional "enemy". Once you found the correct path to take, you can finish a level without much trouble. Collecting coins is optional but to unlock more levels you'll need a certain amount.Dont bother with the DLC since all it does is add 3 additional levels which arent too interesting nor challenging and you'll be done with those in no time.I guess this is a good choice when you feel the need to take a break from other games that piss you off.On a side note: Whenever I start this game and the splash screen "Plays best on Alienware" shows up I just cant help myself and I have to laugh.;Recommended;11.1;29/11/2013;42;7
Fatshark;Hamilton's Great Adventure;Adventure, Casual, Indie;R$ 32,99;This is a rather long review, so if you want a quick summary of why I recommend this title just skip to the Results section and read from there.Fatshark created a fantastic little puzzle game which puts you to the test. Hamilton’s Great Adventure pushes out levels that pose mysteries and threats around every turn. Story:Hamilton’s Great Adventure starts you off telling the stories of your great exploits to your granddaughter. You relive Hamilton’s glory days as you try to get the parts for a machine required for a purpose you will learn if you beat the campaign. You and your bird, Sasha, must complete puzzles from Brazil, Egypt, India, and the Secret Islands. As the game progress Hamilton gets further into his tale and new characters are introduced. The game includes hilarious dialogue, with an interesting story that keeps you guessing, and levels that keep posing new challenges. As you progress through the game you obtain answers to the mystery and you learn all about how the story began. Gameplay:Hamilton's Great Adventure is a puzzle solving game which knowing the answer is the key. Unlike some puzzle solving games where you can see the solution but be unable to complete the challenge because of a simple annoyance in clicking a button at exactly the right time. This game puts your mind to the test to solve puzzles by completing challenges by using the correct answer. It’s fun and rather simple, yet some puzzles are a little more difficult than others. The games graphics are not the best, but they are crisp and the story is pleasant. Sasha can be difficult to control and managing two characters is rather difficult if you are not on your toes. Menus:One of my major gripes is that the in game menu is annoying to navigate. They tried to make the menu look like a book, but this is not very useful as you don't actually know what information is on what page. Ultimately you may have to flip through the whole book if you are looking for a simple answer. Hints:The pink vials are used to power up Hamilton’s special abilities. You can play as Sasha at the start of the level before activating the timer, so if you want to you can gather lots of the pink vials before even technically starting a level. You can also scare off the flying blowfish that attack Sasha by using a taunt when they are about to hit Sasha (it causes them to blow up and float away).Result:Hamilton's Great Adventure doesn't pull you in keeping you on your toes from level to level. yet, the game offers fun puzzles which you can solve during your spare time. I would like it if they had checkpoints. I don't play too many puzzle game so maybe they all don't have any checkpoints during levels. If you like to solve puzzles and you're tired of traditional puzzle solving games that challenge a user based on luck or precise click timing then this is for you. Pros:+Simple gameplay without too many commands to learn+Smooth movements+Fun and rather complex puzzles+Fantastic difficulty curve, the puzzles get gradually more difficult rather than exponentially+Nice art style which makes the games simple graphics seem rather elegantCons:-Very difficult menu navigation-Not a very riveting story (though it’s a puzzle game so you're here for the puzzles not for the tale)-Can be infuriating when you have solved the first part of the puzzle, but have to keep resolving to get to the second part of the puzzle;Recommended;8.0;22/02/2014;22;N/I

Hello Games;No Man's Sky;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.I really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. The game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. I love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…The sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. The truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.I’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.Every now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.10/10;Recommended;116.4;4/07/2022;2,672;101

Hello Games;No Man's Sky;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;EDIT, 6 Sept 2021: No Man's Sky is no longer 'mixed'! Congratulations!Original Review:Don't let that "mixed" up there under review scores fool you: this game has changed SO much from its disastrous launch back in 2016. When this launched it was, as one commentator put it, "wide as an ocean, but shallow as a puddle." But Hello Games did something remarkable: instead of devolving into pay-to-win bullsh*t like we have seen time and time again, they sat back down, got to work, and have spent nearly five years releasing free update after free update, transforming the game in such a way it makes the launch build look like an early access beta.Want to be an explorer and just find as many planets as possible? Go for it. Want to be a space pirate and just steal all the stuff you need instead? Go ahead. Want to stick to just a few planets and build a mega industrial complex that prints more money than 1920's Germany, then realise that you're way in over your head and need to build a money farm just to build your money farm? Have fun. And if any of this is too boring alone, toss down a portal and invite your friends to play. If you bought this back at launch and felt like it was boring or shallow, I say to you, give it another go. I did, and I can say wholeheartedly that I was not disappointed.Bravo, Hello Games.

They could run from the game with all our money, they could abandon the game like Bioware with their anthem, they could put subscriptions and microtransactions upon their paid game like what Bethesda do with their Fallout 76, they could put DLC upon DLCs like what so many developers do with their games, but nope. They go back to the office and get ♥♥♥♥♥ done, polishing what should be a giant pile of disappointment into an actual good stuff with constant updates. For that, the team got my respect for their commendable attitude.

Hello Games;No Man's Sky;Action, Adventure;R$ 162,00;I was one of the many people who pre preordered this game at launch. I bought a second hand ps4 just to play this game, i was fully aboard the hype train. After 30 hours in game at launch..  I wasnt angry, just disappointed. But thats so much worse isnt it? I turned off that ps4 for the final time in august 2016 and never turned it on again. I ignored every update they released, assuming at its core the game was the same. My little gamer group decided to randomly give it a chance last week on steam, and oh boy is this game different. Imagine the hype you felt at this games announcement, imagine all the things hello games promised coming to fruition. Now imagine they added more stuff in... just because. No mans sky has quickly and vehemently become my new obsession, the gameplay is engaging, immersive, fun and full of "wow" moments. Its buttery smooth, so well optimised and cross play pretty much sets itself up.You play it for a bit, hit up the wiki for an answer to how to find a good ship, then you spend 4 hours deep diving into the lore, which is where i got fully hooked.  The lore is incredible. This is the game i always dreamed of, and i imagine the game sean and the team originally thought up in their caffeine fueled manic state. And, they are constantly updating it with major content additions. For free.No loot boxesNo dlcFree. For anyone asking "should i give NMS another chance?" The answer is hell yes, DO IT NOW.

Hello Games;The Last Campfire;Adventure, Indie;R$ 46,99;The Last Campfire is a lovely puzzle adventure that brings an inspiring story about hope. This story is lived by Ember, who in a very kind and compassionate way tries to help other characters in the game, called forlorns, to have again hope and a purpose to keep moving on.In addition to the heartwarming story, the game also features very cleverly designed and creative puzzles that will always bring a pleasant satisfaction for solving them. The art is wonderfully inviting, and the soundtrack is a treat to the ears. It has no missable achievements, and the collectibles, while not necessary for completion, add a lot to the game's narrative.I finished the game in about 8 hours and I'm glad I explored every bit of it, because it was definitely worth it.

Hello Games;The Last Campfire;Adventure, Indie;R$ 46,99;The Last Campfire is a visually gorgeous game about the quest for the meaning of life and what defines home.  It explores the need for hope in our lives and has a touch of melancholy when it dives into our human frailties.  It is very cute and colorful, but there is a dark side to it that may frighten children under the age of 8.The whole game has a relaxing feel to it.  There is no pressure other than what you put on yourself.  There is no violence, no fighting.  Just a lot of brain teasers and some delightful characters along the way.  Be prepared to be touched now and then by the dialogue as you can relate to how the forlorn feel.The story is about Ember who gets lost and has to travel through forest, marsh and caves to find his way back home.  On his quest, he meets fantastical creatures and spirit guides who are at each campfire.  It is from the spirit guides that he discovers about the forlorn…embers who had given up or who had lost their spark.  Ember carried the light of hope within him and his compassion and love for the forlorn really strikes the heart.Many of the forlorn are us when we are drowning in sorrow. when we lose hope and our confidence. when we feel abandoned or lonely. when we feel confused or discouraged. when we are full of doubt or regret. when we feel a failure and want to give up.  All of us need an Ember in our lives and some of us are an Ember to others.  We stir others up to try one more time and that is the story of friendship and community.  These are the topics that come out in the narrative of this game.  Very deep and sometimes sad because not all forlorn want help or to move on.The narration is by a woman with an English accent and she voices the emotion that each forlorn is feeling at the time.  When Ember touches a forlorn, a puzzle is started.  These puzzles are easy to medium level, with a few hard ones thrown in.  These include mirrors and blocks and require some strategy.  Graphics are crisp and colourful.  Each environment is crafted beautifully and the music compliments this.  It is never intrusive, but is enough to enhance what is going on.  Game play is simple.  You can use the arrow buttons (I used keyboard) or just click the ground in front of Ember and he runs to the spot.  His motion made me laugh because he always looked like he was drunk as he rolled side to side!  You also control lights deeper in the game and use WASD to rotate them.I struck no bugs in this game.  The small developer team did an excellent job here and delivered a very meaningful game.  Achievements are easily obtained by just completing each environment.  There are hidden boxes which hide messages and notes from The Wanderer who preceded Ember.  Not finding all of these won’t affect your achievements.Highly recommend.  9/10.   This Ember is now heading off to put a bonfire under someone’s backside!!  Keep shining your light of hope to others.Postscript:  At the end of the game, go back to the main menu and click on puzzles.  There were 5 puzzles that weren't in the game, so a little hidden bonus for us!;Recommended;13.5;17/05/2022;57;1
Hello Games;The Last Campfire;Adventure, Indie;R$ 46,99;The game surpassed my expectations with its charming and well-crafted design. The puzzles, while relatively straightforward, contribute to the smooth pacing of the game. Surprisingly, the world-building and narrative are fleshed out, despite the game's short length. The beautiful artwork, featuring vibrant colors and clean lines, evokes memories of my favorite game, Journey. Moreover, the narrator's presence adds a nostalgic touch, making me feel like a child being read to.While the puzzles provided a good challenge, I only needed to seek help once. I highly recommend this game, especially considering the additional enjoyable puzzles. It's a fantastic game that skillfully explores themes of hope, grief, death, and moving on, all wrapped up in a cute puzzle game with delightful music. The puzzles strike the perfect balance between being challenging and achievable, stealing a piece of my heart along the way.Beyond its stunning visuals and smooth gameplay, the game boasts an intuitive interface. The emotional depth of the dialogue and story caught me off guard, as it warmed my heart and showcased incredible empathy and depth. The captivating aesthetic offers a relaxing experience, accompanied by a mysterious story and a wonderful message. Although the puzzles are generally straightforward, the sense of accomplishment upon completing them remains satisfying.This polished game gem shines with remarkable storytelling, featuring a simple yet meaningful narrative filled with metaphors. Despite the initially pushy narration, it contributes to the fairytale-like experience. The excellent gameplay introduces fresh mechanics, and the puzzles strike a perfect balance of challenges. Overall, I highly recommend this game, especially considering its price. It's truly a worthwhile investment.And if you need a helpful walkthrough guide, I've created one specifically for this game.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger 2 improves upon the first game by adding more vehicles and other ways of transportation. I don't know what to tell you about it really. If you played the first one this one is very similar. Yes, the different vehicles add more variety to the game, but it's still all about collecting stars, letters and other collectibles, while performing as many stunts as you can. Except this time, the whole game is set on a movie set. Even the graphics look the same, with just slightly more variation. Also, the game performs much, much better than the first one. The first one had some annoying frame drops, but JD2 runs at a solid 60FPS at all times. But this Joe occasionally has some frustrating levels with not enough checkpoints.In the end Joe Danger 2 still isn't very long if you don't like to collect stuff, but if you do you're in for a treat. It's a great game, just don't expect too much new stuff. However, if it's your first Joe you have nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the ride ![Rating: 77/100];Recommended;4.2;6/10/2013;45;2
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game is not bad. It feels like ExciteBike at times, and in good, good ways. The controls are good (keyboard at least) and the feel of controlling is pretty much right-on. The style, graphics, and general components of making a game come alive are all there.But there's one big no-go for me, which is the presentation. The concept is fine. A bit dull, but fine. However, there are insufferable cut scenes that are neither helpful nor entertaining, that cannot be skipped. These go on for far, far longer than they need to. This is a game about riding a vehicle, jumping or ducking, and trying to spin as much as possible before you hit the ground again. The story (really, not much going on in that department) is such a thin, forgettable thing, that there is no need for a single cutscene, let alone several.There are tips and tricks screens and bubbles throughout the game, but they are often shown at the tail-end of a cutscene when you are already either frustrated or have tuned out, and after several minutes of irrelevant blather, the useful information is displayed just long enough to recognize what's happening. But before you can read the part about playing the game that could end up helping you, it is gone. It's the Keyser Soze of a hint-screen.When I finally reach the gameplay, there is a fun, balanced, entertaining game underneath. But the shiny, overdone, obnoxious, and person-who-invited-themself-over-and-hasn't-figured-out-it's-time-to-go-home-already atmosphere of all the parts of this game that are not actually the playing of it, really, really sour me on it.I would heartily recommend this if you like the ExciteBike gameplay and don't mind making a sandwich while the cutscenes play. But instead of waiting for my game to let me play it, I'll probably just move on to something else.;Not Recommended;1.5;2/02/2014;66;7
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;I quite enjoyed this game. I've played the main for 100% completion in about 11 hours, having done all the challenges in the game. I really like the music they have in this game. While I'm personally not really a completionist at all, this game did get me motivated to collect all there is to collect.If you are really into speedrunning or score attack games, than this game offers you that and you'll probably really enjoy this game. It offers you ghosts from other people and your own best run to use a reference. I recommend using a joypad though, because keyboard controls just sems a bit too confusing (or at least, for me that was the case). You race through an obstacle couse with some challenges (like doing a whole combo for the full length of the level or collecting all the collectables in the level), you have a nitro to give yourself a speedboost and to some arial tricks with and you can do some simple stunts to fill you nitro meter up again. You can race in various vehicles: a minekart/buggy, motorcycle, mono-wheel and a jetpack, each with their own handling (althoug the 4 wheeled and 2 wheeled vehicles feel a bit similar in my oppinion).Don't get fooled by the multiplayer aspect of this game. They are probaly referring to the leaderboards. There is actually some form of multi-player gameplay, but it's just bad (and only local, not via LAN or the internet) and I strongly recommend ignoring it exists or is mentioned on the store page. Neither should you get fooled by the 'many characters' in the game: they are just skins (and some with some voiceovers) and the game does not always remember which one you used the last time. And sadly, the ghosts are not available in the skin you've played with: they are just orbs of magical stuff in various colors.There is also a level editor and it seems easy to use. I haven't really bothered with it too much, because it's not really my kind of thing. But for people into challenging games and wanting to create a challenge for other people to enjoy: this is it! One thing though: the dev's decided that it was a good idea to force the level editor tutorials down your throught in order to get 100% completion. A decision I frown upon...Nevertheless, I really enjoyed myself with this game. And I think a lot of other people can do to.;Recommended;11.8;11/12/2013;22;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Probably my favorite sidescrolling runner game. The stuntman setting is cute and funny, and it allows you to explore a bunch of different enviroments by going through various "movie sets". There's a good amount of variety in the missions you do. like the classic Trials style single track courses, to multi-track courses, there are even jetpack courses where instead of riding something, you fly a jetpack! The missions are challenging enough to not be too hard/easy, and there's always the bonus objectives if you want more. All in all, it's a really solid game that I believe stands out among the crowd of all the other runner games.Worth checking out?: YesLikeliness of being bundled: LowPrice you should pay?: ~$3;Recommended;1.5;2/01/2016;10;2

So if you're into that (and why would you be?) i guess this game is for you.  I would still recommend this even with its fundamental flaw, based solely on its charming aesthetics.  The name of the levels are punny if not satirical. and the different vehicles and collectibles keeps the gameplay interesting enough to keep you playing the game, at least until you don't have nearly enough stars to unlock the next level.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger 2 is the same basic concept as the previous game in the series.  Instead of only riding a dirt bike, now you can ride a quad, a snowmobile, a jet pack, and more.  The obstacles are very similar where you have to maneuver through each level avoiding bear traps, spikes, and other deadly obstacles while also trying to accomplish your level goals such as beating a time, doing tricks 100% of the level, or hitting specific targets.The game starts off real easy and progressively gets harder.  The game is an absolute blast and should be played by all.  This is what Excite Bike should have been and the developers have truly attained an astonishing level of fun with this game and the entire series.Don't miss this game if you haven't had the opportunity to play it.  Of course, it does come with a couple draw backs.  One is that some achievements are broken unless you know how to download a previous version of the game through Steam Console.  There are some good guides out there to help you go to the original DLC version before the update when the achievements worked.  Also, if you want to play multiplayer with multiple controllers this will not be an easy feat on a single computer.  You will need to download a 3rd party controller program to help allow more than one controller to play at once.However, now with Steam Remote Play this game is easily accessible for multiplayer purposes and it kind of gets rid of the issue that was detailed above.  Still though, regardless of these downfalls in the game, the overall gameplay, graphics, and fun factor of this game makes this a very highly recommended game.;Recommended;75.4;4/03/2020;7;N/I
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game makes me wish Steam had a neutral rating. It's not bad, but it's not really good either. The screen is often too cluttered with explosions and various other moving parts, making it easy to lose track of your stuntman. Check out the original game first. It's the better of the two.

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Try as I might I can't seem to find the fun.I'm normally a fan of this style of game but Joe Danger 2 just seems to never quite get fun. I think its biggest problem is that its just too messy. Details are well and good but this game just plain has clutter. Then its just not presented in a way that's interesting or cohesive. Which compounds the problems of the convoluted rewards system that is never rewarding. And finally the gameplay itself isn't fun. Again, its messy. They avoided the "endless runner" approach since some levels require reversing or braking. But then there's boosting, tricks (which are required to be done throughout a level for certain rewards), tilting/flipping, as well as a priming duck/jump. Its just like one thing too many for the extremely short cluttered levels. I don't know what to say other than it just plain doesn't work. Even attempting to get all the goals on each level and go for the 100% doesn't provide an extra incentive. I just couldn't find any fun. Only played past the first few levels just to say I did and give it a fair chance to open up into something better. It never did. Easy one to skip.;Not Recommended;2.7;3/11/2017;5;N/I

Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;I purchased this game for my son. I  read some reviews and watched the gameplay videos and figured that the game would be appropriate for a 6 year old. While the game is more than satisfactory for my son it is also hours upon hours of fun for myself. I play a lot of FPS, flight sim, and TF2. Most of these games have excellent gameplay with great graphics  and serious story lines. This game was a fun and lighthearted change of pace. I have had fun playing maps over and over finishing level accomplisments and laughing at the cartoon daredevil crashes. The graphics are fantastic cartoon graphics, the controls are easy to learn and with a control that fits his hands my son easily plays this game accomplishing levels and stringing together combos of stunts. This game belongs in the library of anyone young or old that plays games because everyone wants to have some relaxing fun occasionally. The levels are chanllenging enough to be interesting without it being too hard for a child to play or too easy for an adult to enjoy. Excellent game.;Recommended;5.5;3/07/2014;124;5

Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game is a lot of fun. Think Excitebike, in terms of how it plays. Basically, you’re attempting to reach the finish line, while racking up as much points as you can, and completing as many objectives as you can. Because there’s three lanes on (almost) every track, there’s always an objective or two (or more) that you can’t get in one go, so there’s always an incentive to go back and replay the level. Perhaps I never sat down and studied the moves, but it does feel like you can just mash buttons and get a really good high score, so I don’t like that necessarily, but on the other hand, it is a good game to mess around with. The game includes a level editor that you can create your own tracks with, but I didn’t get to mess around with it too much. The one thing that I will say that’s negative about the game is that there’s a certain track that comes out of nowhere and is just down right infuriating. it took me hours and hours to beat. Still, I would recommend this game, and while I haven’t played the second game, there’s a bundle that includes Joe Danger 2 for very little extra. Something to consider.;Recommended;7.5;1/01/2014;32;N/I

Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game has it all.  It's got fun gameplay for both single player and multiplayer (couch co-op) and a whole lot of laughs.  You take on the role of Joe Danger who goes through crazy obstacle courses over close to a dozen different worlds with multiple levels in each world.  The amount of races is beyond what is expected of a game who doesn't rehash the maps and just to a mirror version of them.  These are unique maps on each level.Each level offers a variety of achievements that you can get such as doing tricks the whole time, hitting certain bulls eyes that are littered over the level, collecting coins, beating a specific time, and finding special stars, and more.  This not only gives you an obstacle course to overcome, but once you beat it and have learned the level, then you get to try and accomplish the sub goals of each level, which is fun.  Some of them, in order to get the pro-medals you must beat all the achievements/goals in one run which can be pretty difficult.The graphics are fun, very cartoony, and perfect for the type of game where you character will get beat up constantly from your failed attempts.  This is where you laugh out loud while racing as you see the end results of your failures.  The game is played in 2D, but the graphics are 3D and sometimes when you fail an attempt and get launched, you'll get launched into the world rather than on the 2D track you were following.There are different modes of game such as you being the bowling ball with you bike and trying to take down all the pins, racing, beating an obstacle course, or editing the level on the fly while racing in order to beat the level.  The editing levels are quite different, but are welcome, especially as you get to the end where it really shows you what you can do with the build up.In fact, it's a great way to get your appetite whet for making your own levels from scratch.  Joe Danger offers a huge amount of community levels, some of which are quite difficult and others fun.  Unfortunately, there are also a lot of horrible levels out there from people who uploaded a simple design just for the achievement.  I'm guilty of this too.The reason I have so many hours on this game is that it's incredibly hard at the latter levels.  There is so much happening in a single level that even when it is memorized, the physics of the game work well enough that simple bumps on the road can alter how you jump or drive, so it keeps you on your toes.  I finally just unlocked the last of the achievements and those last few levels were truly difficult and quite the challenge, but more the reason to love this game.Definitely pick this up if you get the chance, I've had so much fun playing this by myself, with my kids, and this simple Excite Bike type game is truly highly recommended, worth every penny.;Recommended;47.1;17/02/2020;12;N/I

Hello Games;Joe Danger;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger reminds me of the NES days of Excitebike, mixed with the modern Stuntman series.  It's a simple lighthearted game that follows Joe Danger through his stuntman career with levels slowly increasing in difficulty.  At its core it's a simple game: Drive through courses gaining score by doing tricks and completing objectives.  The game throws a lot of obstacles at you however, and it can be quite a challenge completing all of the objectives without crashing and while maintaining your score multiplier.The game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Excitebike or Stuntman, or just anyone who likes a challenge.;Recommended;11.6;24/02/2014;8;N/I

Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;Joe Danger 2 improves upon the first game by adding more vehicles and other ways of transportation. I don't know what to tell you about it really. If you played the first one this one is very similar. Yes, the different vehicles add more variety to the game, but it's still all about collecting stars, letters and other collectibles, while performing as many stunts as you can. Except this time, the whole game is set on a movie set. Even the graphics look the same, with just slightly more variation. Also, the game performs much, much better than the first one. The first one had some annoying frame drops, but JD2 runs at a solid 60FPS at all times. But this Joe occasionally has some frustrating levels with not enough checkpoints.In the end Joe Danger 2 still isn't very long if you don't like to collect stuff, but if you do you're in for a treat. It's a great game, just don't expect too much new stuff. However, if it's your first Joe you have nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the ride ![Rating: 77/100];Recommended;4.2;6/10/2013;45;2
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;This game is not bad. It feels like ExciteBike at times, and in good, good ways. The controls are good (keyboard at least) and the feel of controlling is pretty much right-on. The style, graphics, and general components of making a game come alive are all there.But there's one big no-go for me, which is the presentation. The concept is fine. A bit dull, but fine. However, there are insufferable cut scenes that are neither helpful nor entertaining, that cannot be skipped. These go on for far, far longer than they need to. This is a game about riding a vehicle, jumping or ducking, and trying to spin as much as possible before you hit the ground again. The story (really, not much going on in that department) is such a thin, forgettable thing, that there is no need for a single cutscene, let alone several.There are tips and tricks screens and bubbles throughout the game, but they are often shown at the tail-end of a cutscene when you are already either frustrated or have tuned out, and after several minutes of irrelevant blather, the useful information is displayed just long enough to recognize what's happening. But before you can read the part about playing the game that could end up helping you, it is gone. It's the Keyser Soze of a hint-screen.When I finally reach the gameplay, there is a fun, balanced, entertaining game underneath. But the shiny, overdone, obnoxious, and person-who-invited-themself-over-and-hasn't-figured-out-it's-time-to-go-home-already atmosphere of all the parts of this game that are not actually the playing of it, really, really sour me on it.I would heartily recommend this if you like the ExciteBike gameplay and don't mind making a sandwich while the cutscenes play. But instead of waiting for my game to let me play it, I'll probably just move on to something else.;Not Recommended;1.5;2/02/2014;66;7
Hello Games;Joe Danger 2: The Movie;Action, Casual, Indie, Racing;R$ 24,99;I quite enjoyed this game. I've played the main for 100% completion in about 11 hours, having done all the challenges in the game. I really like the music they have in this game. While I'm personally not really a completionist at all, this game did get me motivated to collect all there is to collect.If you are really into speedrunning or score attack games, than this game offers you that and you'll probably really enjoy this game. It offers you ghosts from other people and your own best run to use a reference. I recommend using a joypad though, because keyboard controls just sems a bit too confusing (or at least, for me that was the case). You race through an obstacle couse with some challenges (like doing a whole combo for the full length of the level or collecting all the collectables in the level), you have a nitro to give yourself a speedboost and to some arial tricks with and you can do some simple stunts to fill you nitro meter up again. You can race in various vehicles: a minekart/buggy, motorcycle, mono-wheel and a jetpack, each with their own handling (althoug the 4 wheeled and 2 wheeled vehicles feel a bit similar in my oppinion).Don't get fooled by the multiplayer aspect of this game. They are probaly referring to the leaderboards. There is actually some form of multi-player gameplay, but it's just bad (and only local, not via LAN or the internet) and I strongly recommend ignoring it exists or is mentioned on the store page. Neither should you get fooled by the 'many characters' in the game: they are just skins (and some with some voiceovers) and the game does not always remember which one you used the last time. And sadly, the ghosts are not available in the skin you've played with: they are just orbs of magical stuff in various colors.There is also a level editor and it seems easy to use. I haven't really bothered with it too much, because it's not really my kind of thing. But for people into challenging games and wanting to create a challenge for other people to enjoy: this is it!

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;Terraria's latest major update, Journey's End (1.4) Labor of Love (1.4.4) is here. And it's great! I'll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the game is essentially complete and is full of content (and thanks for all the feedback on my review! It's much appreciated).Intro:If I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.Building:When Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. So many creations made in this game are incredibly good.Difficulty:Overall, Terraria with a Classic (AKA Softcore) character and Classic (AKA Normal Mode) world is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you’ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert Mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master Mode, giving you more loot than Expert Mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could create a Mediumcore character (drop all items on death), Hardcore character (permadeath), or use a world seed such as For the worthy. There is also Journey Mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can’t go to Classic, Expert Mode, or Master Mode worlds). Personally, I think playing a Classic character in Expert Mode is the most fun way to play.Music:Terraria’s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.Connection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I’ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player(s) can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.Performance:Terraria runs very well. On my gaming PC, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my over a decade old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.There are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.Price:Terraria is very inexpensive. It’s one of the few games I’ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.Struggles:Terraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you’ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn’t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can’t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don’t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don’t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won’t get every item in the game, if that’s what you’re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it’s possible to get every item in the game, but it’s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it’ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it’s not fun to abuse these).Tips:* Organize and name chests ASAP* Place rope down a Hellevator* Coral Torches are waterproof and Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) are liquidproof, making them ideal for being placed on bridges and Hellevators* The Smart Cursor, toggled on or off using Left Ctrl by default, is extremely useful for digging straight tunnels, building structures such as bridges, removing large areas of walls, and other functions. However, don't forget to toggle it off when you're not using it since things can go out of control* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can infect the Jungle biome over time* Go fishing. It’s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 1 in 3 chance to not consume potion ingredients* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms* Use Warmth Potions while fighting cold/ice-themed enemies (Deerclops, Frost Moon, etc.)Conclusion:I've played this game for over a decade now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after well over a thousand hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.;Recommended;1,571.2;5/05/2020;2,96;64

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;I've never actually taken the time to write out a real review of a game, but this one absolutely deserves it.Terraria was my first ever game on PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further. Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime. After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on. With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me. Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors. Sincerely,Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen;Recommended;1,821.6;21/12/2020;973;23

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;You feel an evil presence watching you... This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.  Fortune and glory kid...;Recommended;204.1;7/06/2017;3,619;135
Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;After playing the game since 2011 I have just realized I have never left a review.Well...I have pirated the game and then I have bought game several times for myself, and several times as a gift for others.I have played the game solo, with friends, with my girlfriend and planning to introduce it to my daughters (who were born since the game launched).I have spent hundreds of hours on 1.0... hundreds of hours on 1.1... on 1.2... on  1.3... and planning to spend hundreds more on 1.4.I have built, fought, explored, created wild-life reservation worlds as well as apocalyptic wastelands...

Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10;Recommended;891.4;28/05/2017;917;25
Re-Logic;Terraria;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG;R$ 32,99;So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria: - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements- It has an incredible amount of content to it- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!- I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTINGCons? Hmm.- Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!- Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. Other thought: - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. I spent $10 on this.;Recommended;1,063.4;24/12/2018;660;27
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned by the original Devs and they've hired another guy to basically do little more than bug fix.  The addition of new features is a pipe dream that will likely never come true.  Over a year ago the original devs were promising all sorts of things ("Both seamonsters AND weather are already on the drawing board. Expect them within a month or so!" - December 2013).  None of these things happened and were lies.The game has Three locations and that is it.  Islands, where you kill anyone on it.  Sea battles, where you just board a ship or shoot it.  Town islands, where you buy things and hire new pirates.  At the start the game is pretty fun until you realise this is literally all there is to the game, the mechanics do not develop, new things are not introduced.  You will do the same thing you did in hour 1 in hour 100 (Other than shoot cannons).  Cannon fights are ridiculous, you could spend tens of hours collecting a crew, training them, equipping them and yet in a single cannon fight many of them will die, making all your hard work pointless.There is no real plot.  No real characters.  The music is average.  The graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same.  The gameplay is basic (You order your entire crew with 1 click..you cannot individually select) and it does not develop.  Frankly, the Devs should be ashamed for cashing in on an idea and then abandoning it, breaking hundreds of promises they made and hiring some random guy to do little more than take the blame.  Don't buy the game, the developers don't deserve the money and it sends out the wrong message if you do so.Edit: After announcing they were making a new game and seeing the negative reception it got, they announced a "free redux edition" for the game a week later, in an attempt to win back fans.   This doesn't change my review.  The game is still currently poor, was released unfinished and it's taken the dev 6 months of silence before announcing anything.  A games review is a review of the game. not future promises.;Not Recommended;9.8;11/10/2014;1,772;28
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Lots of fun for a small indie game. Not fully completed, but the dev is back and releasing updates after 7 years away and I'm thrilled to see where it goes!;Recommended;13.9;30/01/2023;177;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.Anyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here: -Pirates -Roguelike -Customizeable crew and ship -Characters level up, have equipment and skills -Freeform explorationBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of "early access" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad: -Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best. -Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting ♥♥♥♥ off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship. -Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so) -Multiple crew with the "cleaning" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it. -Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger. -"Animals" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded. -Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please. -It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders. -Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely "rinse and repeat". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs. -Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example. -The sound effects get old real quick. "JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER." -The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying. -Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a "quest", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly. -Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295086852 -Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross "destroyed" tiles. -I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't "beat" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.Most of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game. don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly "difficult" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of "early access", but that's not the case.I'll update this review as things change.;Not Recommended;6.7;1/08/2014;933;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Most of these negetive reviews were from many months ago, but I feel like a lot of progress has been made in this game. I for one find it very fun. + I really enjoy how you get to build your own pirate ship out of parts you plunder or buy. It is very fun to do that and you can take pride in your ship, but also you can capture other ships you find and abandon your creation. + Another great aspect is how you get to hire your own crew. There are tons of randomly generated people on the islands to hire and it is basically like having a follower in an RPG game, but you control them at the same time. The exploration is pretty great and very enjoyable, through finding peaceful islands to ones swarming with hostile natives, or attacking enemy ships on the seas. You can find great loot almost always which is a good incentive to keep exploring, so you can upgrade your ship more.+  A cool aspect is food management, so you have to make sure you stop by some main islands every now and then to get food for your crew. It keeps things realistic and there are times where you can be in a pickle, having to get back fast for food in the beginning. Later on though you can be able to keep a large amount of food on ship so it isn't as much of a problem.+The areas are rated on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty, so you know where to explore and where to go if you want a challnge. A bigger challenge means bigger rewards, like getting better plunder from an enemy ship (or you could just capture it). However it would be difficult to defeat the enemy pirates and natives to get to that point anyway, so it is mostly just a good way to see how the difficulty progresses until you get to the final 4 (ranked 10).However, there are some negetives to this game, but nothing major stood out. - The controls and how to play weren't explained very well, but it isn't that hard to figure out and a quick google search every now and then in the beggining could fix my problems, like how to feed myself and my crew.- The combat is pretty weak. I personally don't mind it, but you just click on enemies and your people attack them. It can be a little boring combat wise from just having your crew do thigns on their own with no input by you, by you can control who they attack and if you want them to go somehwere during fights.- There isn't much depth to the game other than to explore and plunder to get a bigger and better ship and more crew. The journey to get there is fun, but once you get there and clear all the enemies, you probably have to start a new character to continue having a challenge.Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It is worth the $10 I'd say, but I would reccomend holding out for a sale or using one of those coupons. It is very fun to explore and battle and customizing your ship and crew is something I really enjoy.;Recommended;10.1;6/01/2015;205;8
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned in an uplayable state. -DO NOT BUY-. A game breaking bug exists whre the Captain (player character) will get stuck and unable to move, meaning no further progress into the game. This happens arounf level 9.

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Very unfortunate to recommend against purchasing this game. The developer put a lot of love and work into it, and even recommends and facilitates people downloading the game via torrent first before buying. He put forth a rather ambitious development schedule and stuck to it. People who are saying he abandoned the game are not STRICTLY correct.That said, there are just too many game breaking bugs. The game was not left in a working state, and you will not be able to play it from start to finish without needing to load a save to avoid a bug. Most catastrophic from the state I currently see the game is pathfinding issues, specifically when landing on certain islands - this results in your characters either becoming stuck motionless on land until they are told to board the ship - at which point they dive into the ocean - or your captain becomes permanently immobilized on land. This is a very, very - very common bug, and you should expect it if you purchase this game.While I certainly support a developers decision to move on, especially when they were clear about their  games' development timeline, and love that the developer encouraged people to download the game and try it before buying it - I simply cannot under any circumstances advocate leaving a game that people payed for in such a broken state.Sadly, I do not recommend you purchase this game.;Not Recommended;99.6;31/08/2016;69;N/I
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I'm surprised this isn't Early Access, as it feels incomplete as-is and suffers a few game-breaking bugs. Skills and items, like Ship Repair and Chicken Nests, are obviously not finished/implemented into the game. There are also a few odd design choices that affect the game balance. Certain buffs are able to be applied to all crew members and stack, therefore making the game an odd one where it gets exponentially easier as it goes on. The first island should not feel more difficult than the final boss(es), imo.Gameplay wise, it's surprisingly similar to FTL. The ship combat and map, at least, have a lot of the same feel. You hire crew (which you have to keep healthy, happy, and fed), and you sail around plundering. There are three location types in the game - islands, towns, and other ships. Within those three, there are a few different flavours (cannibals or hags on islands, big ships or little ships, towns wih differing supplies). With the exception of a few bounty hunter fetch quests, and an option at the beginning to toggle a plague (which I didn't), there are no other events or surprises in the game. It starts to feel remarkably similar after a while, but more content should be on the way. The goal is to beat up progressively tougher opponants for progressively better loot, until you fight the final four bosses (conveniently spread WAY OUT across the huge map). Defeat them, and you get a cute song and the ability to continue playing. I'd suggest watching the cute song on Youtube and buying FTL.About 14 hours to complete Campaign mode on Beginner settings. I'd say around 3 of those hours (at least) was spent sailing - ie browsing the web in Steam's overlay, and closer to 8 hours if you don't count restarting after bugs/crashes (e.g. reloading caused my first mate to become captain while my captain was still alive, neither could progress).All that said, it's not a BAD game. I enjoyed it, but have no desire to play it any longer as is. When it's done, it'll probably be a pretty fun open world pirate sim. It definately has charm and personality. Certainly it's not worth the price right now, in Oct 2014. Check it out in a year and see where it's at.;Not Recommended;14.7;11/10/2014;283;6
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;So normally I would write a more concise review analyzing a game, and looking at all the good parts of it but also all of it's faults. Pixel Piracy is this special case where I absolutely adore the concept it delivers and the gameplay, but the execution is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful I can't bring myself to play it anymore, I wanted to play it to the end and explore everything, have a massive powerful crew that would dominate the seven seas. Instead we're left with a game that, to put it simply, is badly made. It doesn't work, and yet it 'released' mere days ago. Anyway, here's a list of about everything wrong with this game that will ruin your experience. Some issues may not seem important but do realize that all of them create unfair situations where the player is not at fault and yet the game will end up punishing them anyway or worse, just straight up giving them a situation they cannot get out of because of the god awful AI. So, here's the list.-Crew members acknowledge orders for maybe 1 second before ignoring it and going back to doing something that will probably get them killed or worse-Categorizing Crew members doesn't help much because giving them orders is a waste of time when they continue to do whatever the hell they want anyway. This can lead to crew members with no combat experience or health running out against high level pirates for no good reason. The above point also means that no matter how many times you try to move the low level crew member away from combat, they'll still just run back in and get themselves killed.-Your designated cook refuses to cook because you gave him a secondary job role and he's decided that's more important than cooking food for the captain or any of your crew which leads to the unfair death of you or your crew for no good reason other than the fact your cook decided that patching up the tiny bit of damage the ship took is more important than keeping the crew alive. The same goes for the cook having other jobs like Fishing. The same also happens if they're using interactable furniture like a Card set or Set of Swords. Apparently getting that straight flush is more important than helping your captain not starve to death. The same issue can also occur just from having your ship docked at an island, I don't know why it just bloody does.-Crew members who refuse to eat even when he's starving to death and you do actually have supplies of food. This relates to the above problem, if they have any kind of job or they're interacting with something menial, they will refuse to eat even when they're low on health because of starvation. This leads to numerous deaths.-Having multiple people who use cannons and multiple cannons and yet all of the crew members will use the same single cannon which makes it completely redundant, also half of the time a person who can use cannons simply won't for no reason-Crewmembers in combat refusing to target the enemy you picked for more than a second before choosing their own choice, which most of the time is the enemy with the most health instead of focusing down the person you just spent the last 30 seconds wittling down.-Ultimate skills are trash, it's impossible to tell when they're actually being used and that's because most of the time they're never being used, they're pointless and in 30 hours of playing I have only seen a crew member use one once, and it was useless-Selling cargo is useless and yields such a pathetic amount of gold. This is a game based around piracy, where people stole cargo from others to explot for themselves or sell for riches. In this however, you can steal hundreds of weapons, food and all sorts of other stuff and your reward for doing so is 1 gold per weapon no matter how powerful it is.Pixel Piracy is one of the most annoying games I have ever played. It doesn't listen. I don't think I've ever had to complain about a game not listening to me, where the AI is so brain dead that the simplest of concepts is beyond them, and it always ends up punishing you, for the developers misgivings. I can't recommend this game, please don't buy it in it's current state.

I'll tell you what you're getting so you can decide for yourself.Here's the major points most other reviews are missing:1. This is a sidescrolling RTS, not a platforming Terraria/Starbound clone.You do not modify your surroundings. There is no major recipe-based crafting. You don't WASD to move your hero. you drag a box around the group of units you want to control and right-click to perform move/attack/skill commands. This will not scratch that 2D sandbox-world itch.2. If you don't like the deck-building process of your favorite trading card game, you won't likely enjoy this game.You choose/enhance the characters you want, then their classes, then their tech tree bonuses, and then finally their gear and abilities before every "level." This is literally half the game, and it's akin to the deck-building portion of your typical TCG. You then pit this "deck" of characters against a random series of enemy-filled rooms and hopefully find pride in the outcome of your well thought out preparations. This inevitably results in a couple dozen more items (read: "new cards for your deck") with which you rinse and repeat endlessly. How this comparison is being missed until now is beyond me, but it's an incredibly important aspect to understand before you sink your teeth into this game.3. Your first couple hours can be hard to enjoy as your decisions/mistakes will not feel meaningful/consequential.You won't start off with much of anything to do beyond selecting all of your units, right-clicking bad guys, and waiting for everything to die. Fortunately, this isn't the case after your first hour or two. You'll also eventually realize the significance of your resources as soon as you run out of one for the first time (e.g., the currency for shopping, the currency for cloning items and reviving, the currency for your tech tree, or the fuel for exploring new levels). Much more importantly, however, you'll discover (on your own, after the tutorial) that the difficulty of each individual "level" can be scaled through the roof as you see fit. there's no need to bore yourself to death versus enemies that require no thought or effort to defeat. And before you ask, scaling the difficulty up does reward you with better loot drops accordingly, so it's a satisfying choice instead of an arbitrary, self-imposed challenge.4. The amount of content is appreciably greater than most "loot 'em ups."Each class feels uniquely important with a wide variety of sub-specialties to choose from within each class. The active and passive buffs and unlocks you'll have to pick from in the tech tree are mostly all interesting. The random item modifiers on your gear range from the typical +stats, resistances, and status immunities to auto-casting unique spells on weapon reload and ensuring a chance to drop consumables on kill. The art for each world feels rich and engrossing. The enemies you'll encounter are varied enough in behavior, ability, and art that you likely won't think to complain. The random NPCs and quest-givers you'll come across frequently have distinct personalities and charm. There's also a decently-lengthed story-focused quest line, procedurally generated side missions, unexpected random encounters, and your typical market fare (buying and selling from stores, shipyards, blackmarkets, etc).Update 1: The notable May 2017 patch added new content, bug fixes, more useful tooltips/labeling/hints, and relative UI scaling (i.e., no more unreadably small text).Update 2: The developer, Quadro Delta, went bankrupt on September 4, 2017. Development on Pixel Privateers has ceased accordingly.  If this review was helpful, please say so via the button below. Thanks!;Recommended;22.0;23/02/2017;762;6
Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;The game has some nuances, seemed a little short to me, and the difficulty was a little odd (the first big boss of the game nearly rekt me, yet I was able to face tank the final boss in the game barely taking any damage).  But otherwise, I had quite a bit of fun and safely recommend this game.Pros:+Sense of Humor+This is not Pixel Pirates in space.  Made by the same author(s), there are some small similarities..  but the game plays completely different.+A good selection of unit types, and multiple ways to set up your platoon+Tons of random loot+Space booze+Vanguard Mecha-Suits+Giant Bosses+I liked that every class seemed to have it's own niche, although there is some overlap.Cons:-Too much loot causing too much item management.  Others have mentioned it, and it's true.  I ended up cranking my auto-recycler up to the highest level, and still had plenty of loot to equip and sell.-NO AUTO ATTACK!  This game could desperately use it, as you're forced to micro every single enemy in every single fight, even if you choose to not use abilities and pick equipment with passive bonuses.-Kinda short.  I have 25 hours at the time of writing this, beat the game (as far as I know, don't wanna spoil anything), and did a lot of side fighting for the lulz along the way.  And I've played 2 play throughs, one hardcore that I lost, and one normal that beat it.-Control system and menus take some "learnin'".  The tutorial does a decent job explaining it, but lots to remember/figure out.-Can't kill the flying bunny-Can get repetitious.  Gameplay consists of doing missions on planets (that are always kill missions or item pickup missions) with occaisional random events in between.  It's not terrible and didn't bother me much, but the last 1/4 of my playthrough I found myself skipping missions as much as possible and wasting money on fuel, just to go for main objectives.Edited for typos and a couple things I forgot to add;Recommended;27.2;5/06/2017;281;10
Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;The creating company (Quadro Delta) went bankrupt on September 4th (9/4/2017). which is unfortunate because they were about to push a pretty big update that would add a lot of things, like auto combat.

Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;A great concept, rough around the edges.    I am writing this as a family man with very limited time to sit down and immerse myself in games. As such my leanings lately (2015 - 2017) are games that follow this criteria (This is not exhaustive but I hope I can convey the gist)1. Inexpensive but with good value. pricing is subjective, but some games need the base game plus 4+ extra DLC in order to 'enjoy proper', I avoid this more often than not.2. Playable for minutes or hours but feels like I'm making progress no matter what. Open World games usually suceed at this, MMORPGS however not so much. When I can play in long bursts, Its because I'm enjoying the game not because I need to in order to, Save or progress. Interesting aside, I love Soulsborn because progress happens everytime you play, even if it is minute. 3.  Ability to Pause for long periods while I chase my toddler down, cook, run an errand etc4. Production Value, Mobile games and free to play usually lack this. there are exceptions like Warframe. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The above mentioned list demonstrates my situation fairly clearly I hope, I need a game that I can play within my hectic life, a game with quality that doesn't demand 4 hours at a time minimum in order to feel like that game session was worth it. Pixel Privateers fits this bill for me perfectly. It's playable in 8 hour bursts of for a quick 20 minute mission. So for my lifestyle and if you are in a similar situation to me, it's a candidate for Daddy's 45 minute breathing time until Saul, Underwood and Bojack come back... -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As a game does it hold up??I love the idea. It's a little bit of a few genres I am endeared wtih. I love the ability to name my squaddies. My kids love hearing the stories of their little pixels saving the group or wiping out the bad guys with that new flamethrower. The gameplay is fine, but I find that larger squads require a bit micro management that I am simply not good at. There is a quality of life issue I have. My squad won't attack unless I order them to. I've had situations where I'm in a fight and my squad fights the boss, once the boss dies or explodes into a horde, I have to manually target the lesser enemies, which are small that feels like an extra step that isn't fun. The larger engagements are usually fine, but my squad not defending itself because I can't find the enemy or I'm looking up from my screen for real life issues. It's nothing major but is apparent.The style and presentation are good, Tongue in cheek full of references and I must say, almost obligatory nowadays. There is also alot of downtime between missions as you consider resources, fuel and weapon loadouts. I love it, each mission yields a surplus of items that you can sell for credits, which are used for ship upgrades, having more control on the loot you have via being abe to purchase from the shop or buying more squaddies. The other options are like the Kanai cube/Hordordic cube from Diablo to reroll 4 item types, rarity for different items or rarities and finally broken down into matter, which is used for teleporting your squad to missions and reviving the little buggers should you die on normal mode. All in all, this game is fun, engaging and with its own flaws (That could be patched out easily.... please turn on auto fire!) Thank you for your time in reading this;Recommended;9.4;26/02/2017;55;1
Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;Pixel Privateers is in no way a bad game, however there are issues with the gameplay and mechanics that let it down as a whole.Disclaimer: I do not hate this game, I actually quite like it, however I feel that 87% is too high for what this game offers so I'm writing a review explaining my opinion.Pros:+ART: Some of the pixel artwork is pretty lovely, the bases and planets are well detailed and beautiful+WORLD: The world and concept is nice, it stays pretty consistant with races and characters. There are cyborgs in this galaxy that have spread out over countless worlds, as well as a race of bio-monsters that want to turn all genetics into their fleshy masses of DNA, and you're trying to get technology from these worlds for The Company. It gets a bit more advanced later on, but stays at the 'passable' stages and never quite overtakes a lush and consistent sci-fi world like say FTL+LOOT: There is plenty of Borderlands-esque loot. I also like that what look you equip determines their class. Every character has 4 slots and you can spend ages just fitting out your guys after a couple missions of loot.+TECH TREES: I like the researching mechanic in the game, despite its simplicity. You just pick up items and they gain research points over time which you can spend on identifying rares or upgrading a crew-wide research tree.Cons:-BUGS: Could not use an elevator and had to force quit the game. Melee units would not attack certain enemies. Units would sometimes walk back and forth in the middle of combat and doing nothing. Hold position button does nothing. Right clicking to attack enemies as they beam into your ship causes all your units to move to it. Can cheese losing situations by quitting the game and everybody gets max halth again. Game breaking framerate at some boss levels. Sold all my inventory, went back to crew tab and it was still there. That's just a handful of the ones I remember right now.-SIMPLICITY: At the start, when you have 2-3 guys, combat requires thought, and pausing it with the spacebar. However, late game is just a grind of taking your 8 man squad of level 26 guys with guns, selecting them all, and right clicking every enemy in order until they're all dead. This plays into my next point...-NO AUTO ATTACK!?: Yours guys do not auto attack. This is a huge, huge problem and reduces incentive for using strategic attacks, and encourages just using your entire squad to attack one enemy. Say there's a group of three enemies. if they kill the first one, if you do nothing they just won't attack. they would all die before attacking by themself. This seems to also include turrets and drones. This can be fixed, I'm sure, but it's a massive gaping problem that encourages zerg rushing, and unfortunately the game is still very possible using that strategy. Another problem with this is there is LITERALLY A HOLD-POSITION BUTTON that says "Will attack enemies in range" and it just doesn't! They still suffer from the same auto-attack issue.-VARIETY: There are plenty of enemy types in this game, don't get me wrong. But, as a whole, there seems to be 3 races: Two robots and a zerg-equivalent. The problem with this is that, using the zerg rush tactic explained above, they all have the same tactic to kill them, select everyone, right click, zerg rush, win. Very rarely do you need to, for example, move your guys out of enemy fire, get on either side of an enemy to flank, use abilities to stun or put in stasis.... Coz you just right click them all to death. To put it into perspective, I used exactly the same tactic on the bosses, including final boss. right click it to death and occasionally right click a spawned minion. The healers heal automatically so I don't need to do anything.-SHIP INVASIONS: When you're travelling around on the map, random events can occur, normally being attacked by an enemy ship. This is, without a doubt, the worst (purposely programmed) part of the game. You just walk around your ship, wait for enemies to teleport into the room, and kill them. There's no 'defense' part about it whatsoever, it's just a boring time waster that gives barely any reward. The devs must know this because there's a perk at the start AND a research tree item to lower the chance of it happening.-STORY: The 'story' itself is pretty generic. however my issue is that it drags on for so long. There is absolutely no reason this game needs to go for 12-18 hours. You'll enjoy your first 6 for sure, but the lack of variety in the late game leads to tedium and total boredom. Even the regular missions become a total chore (which you need to do a certain amount of to unlock more missions) of just blasting through 90% of a map. And, I'll put it here. two of the boss stages featured game-breaking framerate issues (The second robot boss and the first zerg boss) where my game slowed down to 10 fps. This is a pixel game. I have no idea why this happens but for lower end computers I can imagine those levels would be a total pain.-PIXEL PIRATES: You've probably realized by now that this game is developed by the same people who made Pixel pirates. Whilst not a bad game in itself, that game lacked a real driving force to grind through its countless bugs and far-too-long campaign. Privateers is better, by a long way (At least I only discovered a handful of bugs with this and not a thousand game breaking ones), it benefits from a more direct approach. However, the late stages feel like a chore with collecting 5 Macguffins, and then in true No Man's Sky fashion, the game just ends and starts you again with a different map but the same characters. If you have never played Pixel Pirates and you like the idea, you will definitely enjoy this game more than Pirates, but understand these games are not perfect. It's a meal-priced RPG strategy-lite.CONCLUSION:If you came to this game looking for an exploration game, you should try Starbound.If you came to this game looking for a space roguelike, you should try FTL.If you came to this game looking for a strategy game, try.... I dunno, Battle Brothers is pretty good lol.And if you came because "It's by the Terraria guys!" no, it's just published by them. If you are really digging for a good strategy-building space game, then you should 100% definitely try Rimworld instead.6/10: Game is functional but lacks a lot of stuff that makes a strategy-roguelike engaging for longer periods of time.;Not Recommended;18.0;25/02/2017;142;N/I
Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;Good, but....The game really needs an option to increase the size of the text on higher resolutions.

Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;A fun loot-gathering game with a ton of options regarding party-comp and character customization. Two characters of the same class need not be the same stat/skill wise, and there are a ton of weapons to choose from (there are no class/weapon restrictions). As an example, my medic uses hammers and gets bonus heals for every attack he does. He beats enemies in the face and heals while he does so.Gameplay is interesting, albeit a bit uninvolved in the early game. Planets tend to be varied and there are a few different objectives that you may receive upon landing. Gameplay consists of the loop of: Prepare party -> go to planet and get loot -> go to galaxy map -> prepare party -> repeatIt's simple, but it's addicting and the varied loot keeps me coming back for more. I recommend it if you're into games like Diablo, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, etc.My biggest gripe, aside from a lack of truly varied objectives, is that controlling five characters is tedious, thus leading me to leave most of them on auto while I control my tank and engineer.  I would like to see more viability for having fewer than five characters in a party (three would be my sweet spot between interesting gameplay/party comp and reasonable micro-management). The game does allow you to pause mid-combat to issue orders, which helps with this. think Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity.Overall, the game is quite fun and offers a really addicting loot-loop that I think will be enticing to many players.;Recommended;7.5;21/02/2017;31;2
Re-Logic;Pixel Privateers;Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 27,99;70/100, not worth $15 yet.The game has potential, but seriously tapers off after a dozen hours.Wait for later patches, see my suggestions. The game feels unfinished despite 1 major 5-part quest chain. ======== Pros/Cons ========+ Great artwork+ Loot-a-holic drops, 8 tiers (grey, dark green, light green, blue, purp, red, orange, and teal)+ Nice skilltree, multi tiers, upgrading both characters and your ship.+ Great rooms system on ships, has more potential later on.+ Love having multiple units, each class has 3 play style options based on their class relic.+ Ability to add difficulty to missions for better chance at loot drops.+ There's a few rerferences to other games, which is a trip.    (Apparently there's a cube recipe for a cow level? I would love to see a wiki for unique recipes)= Music is alright. Not blown away, but not hating it either. Chill, sorta ambient at times. = Matter / Fuel become almost useless over time with high-tier Research Point upgrade.= There's a nice number of planets to check out, but see my notes on level scaling. However, there are a ton of small things that just snowball into a poor experience.These will effect your gameplay, I guarantee it. - Major memory leaks / fps drops: I'm running a moderate+ system (i5 with a 1070 GPU)  I'll drop from 150 frames down to 20 over the course of one map. That needs to be addressed. - No Auto Attack + Hold Commands don't work: I would make more use of tactical pauses, but it's just better to set a 2x4 basic team formation (Vanguard tanks up front, Marines 2nd, Healers 3rd, and Scout/Eng in the back) and just focus fire on one monster at a time. Your units will just sit there and eat damage if you don't do something about it. Keep a finger on Q, you'll be babysitting that key.- Automatic level scaling: I love leveling to zone, and the bosses should reflect that progression as a milemarker.Nothing feels better than grinding hard, swooping solid gear then smashing a boss into next week. (It should be a 15-25-35-45-55, Final 65+ kinda deal.) This way, If I want a hard battle, I can throw on the modifiers. Instead, Give yourself 15+ mins (not kidding) to chip away at each boss and micromanage their timed minion summons. Bosses aren't a challenge as much as they are obnoxius. Every planet auto scales to you, so there's no benefit or need to travel far out to find the right zone.  The level scaling seriously kills the sense of progression in this game. - "Company Quests" are just cheap low-tier item / fuel / matter grabs. Take your pick of the three: Save prisoners, research rooms, collect random drops. Rinse. Repeat.- They need to change the color on their final item tier. Top tier items blend in a little too easily. Try black/red/silver striped boxes or somethin' different. - Multiplayer is a nice feature, but it needs a ton of work. I had some luck with playing LAN, but I have heard horror stories for those not playing locally. - Endgame after the warp: I watched my brother play past the final boss, but... there's... nothing.  No endgame quest trigger, no special company quests, no unique planets. Did we miss something?  Why include it if there is nothing but a replay of the same game under the guise of an "alternative universe?"Edit: I made it to the "alternative universe" to see it for myself.... uhhh. Wut. ======= Final Verdict ========70/100The games an alright time sink for now, and with some much needed fixes, it could be worth 15+ bucks.They have a great idea, and some great mechanics already in place.Problem is it's lacking some basic features and endgame content. It still has gameplay killing bugs.Either wait for it to go for less than $6-7 on a sale, or wait until 1.0.2 or much later is released.This game was... finished, but not really, you know?======== Dev Suggestions ========- Fix Auto Attack / Hold Commands- Chef Zakarian made a great point about the game having an RTS feel, but not having a intelligent/behavior autoattack system. I linked his review below:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041699470/recommended/342640/- Remove Level Scaling. It's killing your game.- Address Memory Leaks + FPS Drop. - Please add a convenient to access loot filter. Once you hit 10k Matter, you're really  just looking for Purple's or higher to do cube rolling. Things to add?- Add more quest variants: "Timed" Explore/Kill, Multiplanet Escort Missions, Maybe a "clear infection/wipe out mutiple hives" Maybe a "Distress Beacon, check out this ship" quest. Hell, I would love a "Help fix a warp gate" quest to help create waypoints for far exploring. - Endgame: Perhaps Legendary Class Relic quests, Maybe a rare merchant quest leading to a get upgradeable ship rooms, making matter/fuel useful again.  Introduce Minor/Major sockets add-ons allowing us to tweak with Purple or lesser items. - Play with random encounters: Let me decide to pick up those hitcherhikers that always become Punks invading my ship. Currently they are more of a headache then "oh wow, this could be neat". - Add "warp gates" that we can reach from the outposts, or allow us to save warp locations. - Add "home base" near the first wormhole, where we can store items, maybe have NPCs chill?- Play with your cube crafting system, it's an awesome little thing to gamble/reroll, but you could do some end game customization with it. A recipe tracker tab on the box would be nice.- Trading in multiplayer, it would be nice to have an item/resource economy to encourage dedicated MP. As a side rant, I have put the game down twice trying to get to the 5th boss because I have to fly about 400+ fuels distance (no, I'm not kidding) Why are 4 major bosses within 30 fuel of eachother and this one is so far out?Those interruptions are now the sole the bane of my existence in your game.I wrote this review rather than deal with the trip to the 5th boss.;Not Recommended;23.3;27/02/2017;19;N/I

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned by the original Devs and they've hired another guy to basically do little more than bug fix.  The addition of new features is a pipe dream that will likely never come true.  Over a year ago the original devs were promising all sorts of things ("Both seamonsters AND weather are already on the drawing board. Expect them within a month or so!" - December 2013).  None of these things happened and were lies.The game has Three locations and that is it.  Islands, where you kill anyone on it.  Sea battles, where you just board a ship or shoot it.  Town islands, where you buy things and hire new pirates.  At the start the game is pretty fun until you realise this is literally all there is to the game, the mechanics do not develop, new things are not introduced.  You will do the same thing you did in hour 1 in hour 100 (Other than shoot cannons).  Cannon fights are ridiculous, you could spend tens of hours collecting a crew, training them, equipping them and yet in a single cannon fight many of them will die, making all your hard work pointless.There is no real plot.  No real characters.  The music is average.  The graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same.  The gameplay is basic (You order your entire crew with 1 click..you cannot individually select) and it does not develop.  Frankly, the Devs should be ashamed for cashing in on an idea and then abandoning it, breaking hundreds of promises they made and hiring some random guy to do little more than take the blame.  Don't buy the game, the developers don't deserve the money and it sends out the wrong message if you do so.Edit: After announcing they were making a new game and seeing the negative reception it got, they announced a "free redux edition" for the game a week later, in an attempt to win back fans.   This doesn't change my review.  The game is still currently poor, was released unfinished and it's taken the dev 6 months of silence before announcing anything.

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.Anyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here: -Pirates -Roguelike -Customizeable crew and ship -Characters level up, have equipment and skills -Freeform explorationBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of "early access" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad: -Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best. -Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting ♥♥♥♥ off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship. -Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so) -Multiple crew with the "cleaning" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it. -Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger. -"Animals" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded. -Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please. -It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders. -Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely "rinse and repeat". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs. -Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example. -The sound effects get old real quick. "JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER." -The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying. -Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a "quest", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly. -Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295086852 -Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross "destroyed" tiles. -I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't "beat" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.Most of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game. don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly "difficult" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of "early access", but that's not the case.I'll update this review as things change.;Not Recommended;6.7;1/08/2014;933;5

It is very fun to do that and you can take pride in your ship, but also you can capture other ships you find and abandon your creation. + Another great aspect is how you get to hire your own crew. There are tons of randomly generated people on the islands to hire and it is basically like having a follower in an RPG game, but you control them at the same time. The exploration is pretty great and very enjoyable, through finding peaceful islands to ones swarming with hostile natives, or attacking enemy ships on the seas. You can find great loot almost always which is a good incentive to keep exploring, so you can upgrade your ship more.+  A cool aspect is food management, so you have to make sure you stop by some main islands every now and then to get food for your crew. It keeps things realistic and there are times where you can be in a pickle, having to get back fast for food in the beginning. Later on though you can be able to keep a large amount of food on ship so it isn't as much of a problem.+The areas are rated on a scale of 1-10 for difficulty, so you know where to explore and where to go if you want a challnge. A bigger challenge means bigger rewards, like getting better plunder from an enemy ship (or you could just capture it). However it would be difficult to defeat the enemy pirates and natives to get to that point anyway, so it is mostly just a good way to see how the difficulty progresses until you get to the final 4 (ranked 10).However, there are some negetives to this game, but nothing major stood out. - The controls and how to play weren't explained very well, but it isn't that hard to figure out and a quick google search every now and then in the beggining could fix my problems, like how to feed myself and my crew.- The combat is pretty weak. I personally don't mind it, but you just click on enemies and your people attack them. It can be a little boring combat wise from just having your crew do thigns on their own with no input by you, by you can control who they attack and if you want them to go somehwere during fights.- There isn't much depth to the game other than to explore and plunder to get a bigger and better ship and more crew. The journey to get there is fun, but once you get there and clear all the enemies, you probably have to start a new character to continue having a challenge.Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It is worth the $10 I'd say, but I would reccomend holding out for a sale or using one of those coupons. It is very fun to explore and battle and customizing your ship and crew is something I really enjoy.;Recommended;10.1;6/01/2015;205;8
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned in an uplayable state. -DO NOT BUY-. A game breaking bug exists whre the Captain (player character) will get stuck and unable to move, meaning no further progress into the game. This happens arounf level 9.

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Very unfortunate to recommend against purchasing this game. The developer put a lot of love and work into it, and even recommends and facilitates people downloading the game via torrent first before buying. He put forth a rather ambitious development schedule and stuck to it. People who are saying he abandoned the game are not STRICTLY correct.That said, there are just too many game breaking bugs. The game was not left in a working state, and you will not be able to play it from start to finish without needing to load a save to avoid a bug. Most catastrophic from the state I currently see the game is pathfinding issues, specifically when landing on certain islands - this results in your characters either becoming stuck motionless on land until they are told to board the ship - at which point they dive into the ocean - or your captain becomes permanently immobilized on land. This is a very, very - very common bug, and you should expect it if you purchase this game.While I certainly support a developers decision to move on, especially when they were clear about their  games' development timeline, and love that the developer encouraged people to download the game and try it before buying it - I simply cannot under any circumstances advocate leaving a game that people payed for in such a broken state.Sadly, I do not recommend you purchase this game.;Not Recommended;99.6;31/08/2016;69;N/I
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I'm surprised this isn't Early Access, as it feels incomplete as-is and suffers a few game-breaking bugs. Skills and items, like Ship Repair and Chicken Nests, are obviously not finished/implemented into the game. There are also a few odd design choices that affect the game balance. Certain buffs are able to be applied to all crew members and stack, therefore making the game an odd one where it gets exponentially easier as it goes on. The first island should not feel more difficult than the final boss(es), imo.Gameplay wise, it's surprisingly similar to FTL. The ship combat and map, at least, have a lot of the same feel. You hire crew (which you have to keep healthy, happy, and fed), and you sail around plundering. There are three location types in the game - islands, towns, and other ships. Within those three, there are a few different flavours (cannibals or hags on islands, big ships or little ships, towns wih differing supplies). With the exception of a few bounty hunter fetch quests, and an option at the beginning to toggle a plague (which I didn't), there are no other events or surprises in the game. It starts to feel remarkably similar after a while, but more content should be on the way. The goal is to beat up progressively tougher opponants for progressively better loot, until you fight the final four bosses (conveniently spread WAY OUT across the huge map). Defeat them, and you get a cute song and the ability to continue playing. I'd suggest watching the cute song on Youtube and buying FTL.About 14 hours to complete Campaign mode on Beginner settings. I'd say around 3 of those hours (at least) was spent sailing - ie browsing the web in Steam's overlay, and closer to 8 hours if you don't count restarting after bugs/crashes (e.g. reloading caused my first mate to become captain while my captain was still alive, neither could progress).All that said, it's not a BAD game. I enjoyed it, but have no desire to play it any longer as is. When it's done, it'll probably be a pretty fun open world pirate sim. It definately has charm and personality. Certainly it's not worth the price right now, in Oct 2014. Check it out in a year and see where it's at.;Not Recommended;14.7;11/10/2014;283;6
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;So normally I would write a more concise review analyzing a game, and looking at all the good parts of it but also all of it's faults. Pixel Piracy is this special case where I absolutely adore the concept it delivers and the gameplay, but the execution is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful I can't bring myself to play it anymore, I wanted to play it to the end and explore everything, have a massive powerful crew that would dominate the seven seas. Instead we're left with a game that, to put it simply, is badly made. It doesn't work, and yet it 'released' mere days ago. Anyway, here's a list of about everything wrong with this game that will ruin your experience. Some issues may not seem important but do realize that all of them create unfair situations where the player is not at fault and yet the game will end up punishing them anyway or worse, just straight up giving them a situation they cannot get out of because of the god awful AI. So, here's the list.-Crew members acknowledge orders for maybe 1 second before ignoring it and going back to doing something that will probably get them killed or worse-Categorizing Crew members doesn't help much because giving them orders is a waste of time when they continue to do whatever the hell they want anyway. This can lead to crew members with no combat experience or health running out against high level pirates for no good reason. The above point also means that no matter how many times you try to move the low level crew member away from combat, they'll still just run back in and get themselves killed.-Your designated cook refuses to cook because you gave him a secondary job role and he's decided that's more important than cooking food for the captain or any of your crew which leads to the unfair death of you or your crew for no good reason other than the fact your cook decided that patching up the tiny bit of damage the ship took is more important than keeping the crew alive. The same goes for the cook having other jobs like Fishing. The same also happens if they're using interactable furniture like a Card set or Set of Swords. Apparently getting that straight flush is more important than helping your captain not starve to death. The same issue can also occur just from having your ship docked at an island, I don't know why it just bloody does.-Crew members who refuse to eat even when he's starving to death and you do actually have supplies of food. This relates to the above problem, if they have any kind of job or they're interacting with something menial, they will refuse to eat even when they're low on health because of starvation. This leads to numerous deaths.-Having multiple people who use cannons and multiple cannons and yet all of the crew members will use the same single cannon which makes it completely redundant, also half of the time a person who can use cannons simply won't for no reason-Crewmembers in combat refusing to target the enemy you picked for more than a second before choosing their own choice, which most of the time is the enemy with the most health instead of focusing down the person you just spent the last 30 seconds wittling down.-Ultimate skills are trash, it's impossible to tell when they're actually being used and that's because most of the time they're never being used, they're pointless and in 30 hours of playing I have only seen a crew member use one once, and it was useless-Selling cargo is useless and yields such a pathetic amount of gold. This is a game based around piracy, where people stole cargo from others to explot for themselves or sell for riches. In this however, you can steal hundreds of weapons, food and all sorts of other stuff and your reward for doing so is 1 gold per weapon no matter how powerful it is.Pixel Piracy is one of the most annoying games I have ever played. It doesn't listen. I don't think I've ever had to complain about a game not listening to me, where the AI is so brain dead that the simplest of concepts is beyond them, and it always ends up punishing you, for the developers misgivings. I can't recommend this game, please don't buy it in it's current state.

Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;The game has been abandoned by the original Devs and they've hired another guy to basically do little more than bug fix.  The addition of new features is a pipe dream that will likely never come true.  Over a year ago the original devs were promising all sorts of things ("Both seamonsters AND weather are already on the drawing board. Expect them within a month or so!" - December 2013).  None of these things happened and were lies.The game has Three locations and that is it.  Islands, where you kill anyone on it.  Sea battles, where you just board a ship or shoot it.  Town islands, where you buy things and hire new pirates.  At the start the game is pretty fun until you realise this is literally all there is to the game, the mechanics do not develop, new things are not introduced.  You will do the same thing you did in hour 1 in hour 100 (Other than shoot cannons).  Cannon fights are ridiculous, you could spend tens of hours collecting a crew, training them, equipping them and yet in a single cannon fight many of them will die, making all your hard work pointless.There is no real plot.  No real characters.  The music is average.  The graphics are frankly lazy, every island is the same and the background for the world is always the same.  The gameplay is basic (You order your entire crew with 1 click..you cannot individually select) and it does not develop.  Frankly, the Devs should be ashamed for cashing in on an idea and then abandoning it, breaking hundreds of promises they made and hiring some random guy to do little more than take the blame.  Don't buy the game, the developers don't deserve the money and it sends out the wrong message if you do so.Edit: After announcing they were making a new game and seeing the negative reception it got, they announced a "free redux edition" for the game a week later, in an attempt to win back fans.   This doesn't change my review.  The game is still currently poor, was released unfinished and it's taken the dev 6 months of silence before announcing anything.  A games review is a review of the game. not future promises.;Not Recommended;9.8;11/10/2014;1,772;28
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;Lots of fun for a small indie game. Not fully completed, but the dev is back and releasing updates after 7 years away and I'm thrilled to see where it goes!;Recommended;13.9;30/01/2023;177;5
Re-Logic;Pixel Piracy;Adventure, Indie, RPG, Simulation;R$ 46,99;I played this a bunch when my internet was out since it was relatively small (~200 MB) and wouldn't kill my phone's data plan to tether and install. Because of this, my time played isn't accurate - I have about another 10 hours in this game and currently on day 13 of my second save.Anyway, on with this. First off, there's a lot to like here: -Pirates -Roguelike -Customizeable crew and ship -Characters level up, have equipment and skills -Freeform explorationBut it's just not very good. I waited until it was out of "early access" in hopes to avoid a lot of problems, but alas, here I am. Anyway, the bad: -Only the captain is able to follow orders directly - group orders for crew is haphazard at best. -Crew that learn skills for the ship (cooking, cleaning) will do them on their own accord. In other words: even if the food stores are full of uncooked food and you have a cook, if he's too busy punting ♥♥♥♥ off the side of the ship he won't go near it. This has improved with 1.0.5, but can still be an issue for pirates with multiple skills for the ship. -Cooks sometimes won't cook food. So your ship starves to death for absolutely no reason. As it stands in my save now I have around 40 in fish that's uncooked in barrels, with 3 cooks refusing to do anything. (This has been fixed as of 1.0.5 - pirates that don't have the ability to fish or clean but can cook will now do so) -Multiple crew with the "cleaning" skill doesn't make the job go faster. They all scuttle after the same turd and fight over it. -Managing more than a few crew is a nightmare when it comes to moral and hunger. -"Animals" tend to charge in to battle. This includes chickens you're rasing for eggs. They don't survive long, and don't listen to orders very well. This makes capturing animals borderline pointless because they will suicide at the first chance they get when your ship gets boarded. -Custom ship designs tend to screw up pathfinding for your crew. Expect to get stuck. A lot. Don't worry, though! If you grind your ship down to a nub it'll probably fix. Also, the dimensions aren't clear. You'll be building this sweet skiff and all of a sudden you're unable to build in a direction anymore, so you have to restart your design taking in to account this invisible wall. I'd like a grid or something, please. -It's easier to pump up a captain and have him handle mobs of enemies, since he listens to orders. -Combat, both island and ship to ship is largely "rinse and repeat". Cannons are fired in a short volley and then sides clash. Fun for the first few hours, gets kind of grating. No events or anything to speak of so far, at least in my playthroughs. -Many of the items found don't work properly. Sushi, for example. -The sound effects get old real quick. "JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER. JOLLY ROGER." -The inventory gets cumbersome when you pick up a lot of items. It requires a trip to the store to be able to see all of the things you're carrying. -Bounty hunter dialogs are slow and interrupt the player when walking around town. Yes, I know I'm on a "quest", stop telling me. On top of that, bounties don't have a set range, and sailing 30 tiles on the map for a bounty is silly. -Pirates aside from captain will render behind the pirate ships, making it very difficult to track your party. New pirates added to the crew after this bug happens will render properly. There is no way to revert the bug via loading or restarting the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295086852 -Cannons end up severing parts of the ship you're firing at, which makes boarding a problem since pirates can't cross "destroyed" tiles. -I beat the four legendary pirates, but one of the encounters didn't have a captain. I can't "beat" the game with this save now as I had no prompt for beating the four pirates and the bay I'm looking for was never marked or mentioned after doing so.Most of this would be better without the bugs, so there's at least hope that'll be enjoyable in the future. Wait for them to fix the game. don't bother with a discount if the problems never get ironed out because it's really frustrating to play a game that is mostly "difficult" due to bugs. Like I said: I was hoping this game wouldn't be the bug-fest I heard it was when they finally pushed out of "early access", but that's not the case.I'll update this review as things change.;Not Recommended;6.7;1/08/2014;933;5
