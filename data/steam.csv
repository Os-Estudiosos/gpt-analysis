0;Action; 162,00;This game is highly engaging and you feel like you are in Alyx's world.  It is difficult but not too difficult even for a 67 year old gamer like me :);1;48,8;24/05/2020;2181;172;;9.0
0;Action; 162,00;Bought VR  INDEX for retirement. Son built me a gaming computer. Took 8 months for a graphics card. (decent price). All lit up! First game was Half Life. Can't play anything else. I was spoiled to other games without a doubt. I'm a newbie to all this. But the graphics, sounds, gunfights, humor, etc...., was exhilarating. I will often just stay in an area and check out the detailing for 10-15 minutes. Relax. Then KILL again!;1;598,7;5/11/2021;895;49;;9.0
0;Action; 162,00;Honestly - if you are just getting into VR, I'd recommend waiting a bit with this game and to start with other VR games. Why? Because this is not only the best VR game on the market right now, it is years ahead of every other game. Playing this as your first VR game will make every other game feel like a letdown.;1;38,5;14/12/2020;1263;78;;10.0
0;Action; 162,00;"10/10 would wait 15 years again.EDIT: Well, this is getting more eyes than expected and that sounded bad. In a nut-shell, I really love this game, here's my experience, spoiler free so far:The first 10 seconds were breathtaking, literally. I've been playing VR since 2018, a lot of games, and while the first moments of it were amazing, the feeling of presence went down a bit as I went along, playing more games. But this, this is something else. The attention to detail is amazing.Performance is fantastic, I don't really know how they manage to pull that quality and achieve steady 90 fps. That's a technical achievement for sure.As for world interaction / controls, they are the best they can possible be. I've played Boneworks and having physics everywhere is kinda interesting, but just as a concept. Going up a ladder in Boneworks or climbing was awful. The rest was good.HL:A merges the best of two worlds. There's physical interactions for moments where they are needed, but they won't get in your way at all. And I really love that, because is just a frigging game, not a simulation. For example, going up a ladder here, is simple. Opening a door too. It won't get smashed in your face, only features necessary collisions. Also I really love how they went all in and gave physic properties to some enemies. That increases immersion by tons!The hacking puzzles, I had my expectations low, but oh boy, I was really wrong. They are quite fun to do, they are challenging but not tiresome. They provide random patterns so the challenge always stay fresh.The sounds are amazing, I had to take my helmet because I thought a rat came into my room. Then I thought it was a faulty hard disk. Nope. It was the game. I believe the sound experiments they did with CS:GO carried over here and it really shows. Character voices were a bit loud tho.The Half-Life winks are amazing. And for someone who played them all, spent 10 years making a HL mod and basically kickstart a game dev career, it was tear inducing.My only complain is the ammo system. While I love the Tresspasser reference (""Two mags left!"") I really wish I could store back some pistol ammo. I thought that was going to bit a bit more arcade-y, but it's okay, it really helps to build up some tension.I was going to try the game for a bit, ended up playing like 5 hours straight. Couldn't really put it down.The upgrade system is a nice addition. Also for the different enemy types. It's an evolved Half-Life in every way, and is what I expected and much much more.Now, I will get a bit sad for other companies, because they set the bar incredibly high.AAA VR games will be like this, or better, and can't say how really happy that makes me.Go and play it right now and be part of history as this is the VR break trough everybody expected.";1;49,5;24/03/2020;2321;372;;10.0
0;Action; 162,00;Valve made me spend almost 400 dollars to play this game and the worst part is that its worth every penny;1;42,3;12/12/2023;595;75;;10.0
0;Action; 162,00;Half life Alyx is the best reintroduction into the Half Life universe possible.  Even though Valve says this isn't HL3. this most certainly is.  I played with a Oculus CV1 comfortably. Even on low fidelity settings, the game looked beautiful. 13 years was definitely worth waiting for this masterpiece. Unfortunately, My Father, who introduced me to the half life series, passed in 2016 to brain cancer and never got to see such an amazing title and what the future of gaming will be.  I love you dad.;1;17,1;20/04/2020;808;33;;10.0

0;Action; 162,00;I can barely form words after the ending of this game. I will never spoil it for people who have not gotten there yet, so I wont go further into it.This game is a literal masterpiece. From the visuals, to the music, to the story that leaves you questioning everything, Valve has managed to create a VR title set in the Half-Life universe, that rivals all other Half-Life titles. Valve, Half-Life and their other titles saved me from a very dark time 13 years ago. And every Valve title that comes out I give my full attention. This game brought back the feelings of mystery, wonder, and concern on how my favorite characters were going to end up. Even with the knowledge of future events, as this is a prequel, it left you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The story was brilliantly written, and no one could have for seen where it was going. A pivotal roll in Half-Life's overall story and a must play for any fan of the franchise. The graphics were absolutely stunning, and the Source Engine has been changed for the better. Comparing Source with Source 2 is like Source Gold with Source. Stunning difference! Physics are still wonky from time to time, but this made me appreciate it even more. Just like old times!Valve seems to already be on top of patches, so I'll leave the little bugs alone as they have been updating it pretty often over the last few days.I have some issues with how it functions for lower end headsets, like the Samsung Plus, as grenade throwing can be a bit wonky with the controllers going outside the camera's zone. But I don't really think this Valve related per-say, though the amount of times you need to USE grenades could be a bit lower. But all in all, for a lower end Windows headset like mine, I don't have many grips. Controls worked flawlessly and all responded correctly. I used continuous motion but I did find myself using the Teleport to get to places quicker. So a nice medium mix between the two was my sweet spot. Lots of options to mess around with, especially if you get motion sick.I must point out the VAST amount of options you have available. Valve thought of a lot of people with this title to appeal to as many as they could. From Colorblind options to Light Sensitivity for people who suffer from Epilepsy. You can even play with one hand. Teleport, Smooth Motion, and Hybrids are BOTH options. So people who like either one, or both, can use what they are comfortable with. Valve just added Smooth Turning and they also have snap turning if it makes you motion sick. Play around with it, you'll find your sweet spot.All in all, for any Half-Life and Valve fan, this is a MUST! If you don't have a VR to play it, go grab a cheaper one and experience it for yourself. You DON'T NEED an Index to play this game! If you're sure VR is not your thing, go watch a play through on YouTube and support Valve to keep encouraging them to make more games like Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. They seem to have their spark back, and by the gods the STILL have what it takes to make masterpiece games.This final message, though I know they will never see it, is a Thank you to Valve. Thank you for making this game. Thank you for taking me back to a time where I discovered this series. And thank you for continuing to influence my life with all the things you have done for us! Please keep making games, and Thank you so much!;1;46,2;25/03/2020;1441;24;;10.0

0;Action; 162,00;"About 3 hours in, I need to take a break. Here are my initial thoughts in easily-digestible point-by-point form:The game's tech outperformed even my pretty significant expectations. It's by far the best looking (and sounding) VR game I've played. Crucially, the image quality is fantastic, with absolutely no visible aliasing outside of very extreme cases of fine specular detail. And despite all that it maintains a pretty solid 144 (!!) FPS. Sure, I have a fast PC, but it's still a highly competent showing from the engine.The grabbity gloves are an absolutely amazing mechanic. The first 2 times I tried to use them it was a bit awkward, and my reaction was a slightly disappointed ""hmm, that's it?"". The third time it felt better. The fourth time it felt absolutely amazing. And from that point on I just grabbed and threw stuff around everywhere without even thinking about it. This is an extremely polished mechanism of interaction.The attention to detail is great. From startling the cat from the first balcony, over the extremely cool looking puzzles to the interactions with NPCs, to the major scenes, all of it looks like it had a lot of care put into it.Even Valve doesn't have access to magic. While the physics are better (more stable and more conducive to smooth gameplay) than anything else I've played, it's still not too hard to make things explode.Headcrabs. ♥♥♥♥ those.Overall, I can already confidently say that everyone who has access to a VR system should absolutely play this game.";1;4,6;23/03/2020;2007;73;;10.0
1;Action; 4,49;The first Portal had genius, original gameplay mechanics, great story, great level progression, great voice acting, great characters, great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 1, you are a bad person.This sequel brings all those qualities to a new level: _the story is deep_, lots of wow moments, graphics is beautiful, much more levels, environments and elements to solve the puzzles, the co-op multiplayer is so fun it's epic.In my heart and in my mind I have no doubt: _this is the best game ever made_.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 2, you understand nothing about videogames.;1;6,5;11/06/2017;2977;93;;10.0

1;Action; 4,49;Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to sciencePortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to T2: Judgement Day when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.Pros+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this. +Stephen Merchant and J.K Simmons did an absolutely terrific job. Ellen McLain’s performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original!+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by Mike Morasky and The National. +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story. +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. Cons-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV.-Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.  The Bottom LinePortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson. perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer. Highly recommend it to……everyone. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try. My Rating: 10/10  Thank You :D;1;31,4;28/06/2020;288;27;;10.0

4;Action;00,00;"If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.Let me put that into perspective:  541 Days and 16 Hours.  Of dota 2. I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was ""addicted"" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.But I've also relatively learned nothing.Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people,  because  of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: ""what if I just did ... instead"" or ""what if I just played on a more casual level"". The issue is, that dota  feels  more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.Thank you for all that you  have  done for me.

4;Action;00,00;"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.1. general thoughts and how i started:I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music""  or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of ""oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school.

5;Action; 179,99;As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.I should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  So right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  None of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.What kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  I’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.The team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.I’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  I wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.Okay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.The hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  Also I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  I won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  If you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.;1;418,7;24/01/2019;2483;115;;8.0
5;Action; 179,99;After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise. Graphics Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.  Story The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy. The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me. Gameplay If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything. You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities. Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with. As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.  Grind? I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue. Final Recommendation I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss. Pros-Stunning Game World-Interesting Story-Well thought-out RPG mechanics -Tons of things to do-Exhilarating CombatCons-Lame mid-late game pacing-Poor rendering-Executions aren't greatFinal Rating - 8.6/10If you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

5;Action; 179,99;"Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity. an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the ""decisions"" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another. chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!";1;234,8;5/10/2018;1524;32;;8.0
5;Action; 179,99;Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey  ⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:              - Main Story - 43½ Hours              - Main + Extras - 83 Hours               - Completionist - 137 Hours By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review. ⚔ Gameplay: 🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)🔲 Definitely🔲 Infinitely replayableThe game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game. 😄 Fun: 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy☑️ Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember🔲 Ride of your lifeAs a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did. 🏞 Graphics: 🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game🔲 Good (nothing special)☑️ Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceThe graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work. 🔊 Sound: 🔲 Makes your ears bleed🔲 Bad☑️ Not special🔲 Good🔲 Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceI felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven. 📖 Story: 🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story🔲 It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written☑️ Epic story🔲 MasterpieceWithout spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter. 🧵 Length: 🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee🔲 Short🔲 Average☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)🔲 To infinity and beyondAccording to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.I wish it would be shorter. 💷 Price: 🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price☑️ Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of moneyDepending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore. 🧩 Difficulty: 🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it🔲 Easy☑️ Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too. ⚖ Pros & Cons:  ➕ Pros: + The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all. ➖ Cons: - It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.- Too long. I really wish it would be shorter.- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult. only a few of them get that treatment. ⚙ Bugs: 🔲 Never heard of☑️ Minor bugs🔲 Can get annoying🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsI've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU. ⭕Conclusion: AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.Originally posted by TalePlay: If you've read this far, I want to say thank you and do check our Curator Page called TalePlay.

5;Action; 179,99;"I bought the Gold Edition, which seems to have a better value. Here's some info on the different editions:Standard Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game) DELUXE DIGITAL PACK: - Kronos pack - contains the full Armour of Kronos armour set, the Hourglass mount, and the spear ""Harvester of Time"" - this pack gives more warrior damage boost- Herald of Dusk pack - contains the full Herald of Dusk set of armour, and the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focused.- Capricornus Naval Pack - contains the Capricornus boat and sailor skins - purely cosmetic.- Temporary boosts to XP and money - boost lasts for 2 hours.Gold Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)SEASON PASS: LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE, THE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece + The Games: Assassin's Creed III REMASTERED and Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTERED. Ultimate Edition (Digital) Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition - Check the Content Info AboveSEASON PASS - Check the Content Info AboveSo, the only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content. Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on. up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on sale, though I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition.Note:  You can not upgrade to Deluxe Edition later on, meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition, and that's money wasted. Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later on, is not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise. You are saving money and getting the best of the game. For Season Pass owners (which is in the Gold and Ultimate Editions) - Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered will not appear in your library as it is a part of, and available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered. So, in order to play Liberation Remastered, you need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered. Both Remasters are slightly better graphically, than their previous versions. You have to launch Assassin's Creed Odyssey once, before trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition. Otherwise, the Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activation, which is not possible anymore.  For any problems with the Ubisoft client: Verify Integrity of Game Files on Steam and if it doesn't work then uninstall the Ubisoft client and delete the current version and redownload the client from the Ubisoft site. If you still have problems then God help you dealing with Ubisoft/Steam support.

7;Action; 179,99;"(DRM notice: this game requires a Uplay account, requires you to connect to Uplay when starting up, and it also uses Denuvo DRM. DRM is inherently bad for the customer so I wanted to warn you about that.)Far Cry 5 is a decent entry into the series, and often underrated in comparison to previous titles.Honestly, if you played Far Cry 2, 3 or 4 - you know what to expect. Same game, different setting. The main reason people rate it lower than 3 and 4 is because by this point, they've grown tired of the same old formula (and because of the weird ending, but I'm not gonna spoil that... you have to see it for yourself). Far Cry 5 is just as good as its predecessors. That said, let's give this a proper analysis, shall we?You shoot bad guys. This time it's in rural America.It's a Far Cry game. What did you expect? It follows the Ubisoft open world formula of a big world occupied by enemy forces, which you slowly liberate by wiping out enemy outposts like you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rambo. There's a basic but functional stealth system of silent melee takedowns, silent weapons like bows, throwing knives, and silenced guns, and enemies raising the alarm if they see you or find a dead body. You can conquer outposts either by going in slow and methodical, or you can just storm in guns blazing and mow everyone down with an MG. The combat is fun. Controls are pretty smooth, most weapons are satisfying to use, and neither you nor the enemy are bullet sponges. Sometimes you will have to deal with enemy helicopters, or you can fly one yourself to rain death from above. Fun!The only criticism I have compared to earlier Far Cry titles (especially Far Cry 1 and 2) is how the physics engine has been dialed down a bit. Many items are static objects that don't ever move (I kicked a bunch of cans and they just stayed in place... lame), and most cover can't be pierced by bullets, unlike earlier games where thin wooden walls could easily be penetrated by high caliber weaponry. At least the fire spreading mechanics are still there, making the flamethrower a potentially devastating weapon... with which you can easily grill yourself if you're not careful.The game is set in Hope County, a fictional area in the US state of Montana, where a crazy cult is taking over and forcibly recruiting the population. You arrive as a policeman (or policewoman, this is the first Far Cry game with character customization and you get to pick your gender) coming to arrest the leader of that cult, but of course the cultists fight back and you have to run. During the course of the game, you meet with various resistance members and help them fight the cult until they are wiped off the map. The setting is quite enjoyable, especially if you like rural America. As a European, I find American culture quite fascinating, and this game is full of it. All the resistance people are proud American patriots, and you get to see a lot of those weird roadside attractions they have in the rural US, like a park with giant plastic mammoth statues and farms that advertise their tomatoes with giant tomato signs. Very quaint.I got captured... AGAINAs far as the story structure is concerned, the antagonists are pretty interesting and the story overall is competently told. But the way they force you into the main quest missions... yeah, that's definitely questionable. Whenever you earn enough ""Resistance Points"" in a region (by doing side quests or liberating outposts), the bad guys will send a capture party to abduct you. They don't just do it once per region, but several times. When I finished the game, I had been captured at least six times... and if we count the scenes where Faith puts you into a drug-induced trance so she can try and convert you to the cult, that increases to nine times.Nine. Times.And each time, you - of course - manage to escape and kill a whole bunch of cultists in the process. They should have realized that keeping you alive is a bad idea after the second time, but nope. They just keep abducting you and try to convert you to their cause, until you finally kill all the leaders. Of all the methods they could have used to drive the story forward, this is by far the dumbest. It almost feels like the bad guys are deliberately giving you a chance over and over again.The cult leaders are appropriately vile and violent characters, and the acting and animation is really good. I usually hate cutscenes, but I found the ones in Far Cry 5 to be quite engaging, because the characters are so interesting. I have to rate the main story as ""good"", but... the way they keep using that abduction mechanic to drive the plot forward... that's just stupid. So utterly stupid. And the worst part is that it can hit you anywhere once you triggered it. Doing a sidequest right now? Haha sorry, abduction squad is here. Flying around in a helicopter? Yeah there's a sedative arrow in your leg now, don't ask where it came from. It's just dumb.You've seen it before. It's nothing new, but it's good.Really, apart from the dumb way they handled the main story progression with those stupid abduction scenes, Far Cry 5 doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's another competently made Far Cry game. More of the same for people who enjoy this style of game. Open world driving around, shooting bad guys, doing side quests. It even has the same mission types as the previous Far Crys: rescue a friend and man the gun while he drives the truck to your home base, go to a location and kill the enemies, find collectibles and bring them to an NPC, etc etc. The standard fare as usual. Did you play Far Cry 3 or 4? This is like that, except set in Montana instead of a tropical island or Tibet.If you like Far Cry games, you're gonna like this. If you don't, you won't.

7;Action; 179,99;In a nutshell:Pros:1. Good graphics2. Surprises in the story at the end3. Game physics is good4. More involvement of Bosses in game (unlike Far Cry 4), which is good.5. Adds lot more contents in the game when compared to its predecessors.6. Availability of Guns for hire. OR form Your own squad with AI characters, which gets unlocked as the story progress.7. No more tower capture to unlock a region (although some elements of it exists here too)8. More detailed and realistic gun/vehicular battles.9. Support for Co-op in Story mode.10. Arcade mode for some extra game play.Cons:1. Even on pretty good configuration PC(GTX 1070 8GB), FPS drops to 30 sometimes, but not many instances. Probably because the game is tailored for AMD graphics.2. No option to change difficulty in middle of game story. Need to play out entire story in same difficulty level.3. Too much content in Game User Interface (UI) /Map which causes the UI to be cluttered.4. If You are someone who is moving up the far cry timeline and played FC3 and FC4 before this, You might take at least an hour of game play to understand the game features.5. In gun battles, hit reg not accurate sometimes.6. Co-op in story mode restricted to only 2 players in total (i.e. Yourself and one friend).7. If You invite Your friend to play in Co-op, only Your story proceeds/missions complete, and your friend's does not. Above Pros and Cons should be sufficient if You do not have time to read through the detailed review and need to decide if You want to buy this game or not. More detailed review below.P.S: Please play this game before playing Far Cry: New Dawn, to enjoy the new dawn instalment better.In Detailed Review:The Game:Unlike prior Far cry instalments, this game environment has more modern vibes to it. So, You'll have more modern weapons, and visiting a place on the map reveals it. No more tower climbing to remove cloaking.Basically, the map is a group of islands, ruled over by one main Boss (The Father) and 3 under bosses (His 2 brothers and 1 sister, well not biological though, haha). They together form a cult and make life hell for the natives. Its either join the cult or face Your maker, simple right?So, You play the role of a rookie deputy who will fight Your way to liberate the islands, and there is lots of story and elements to it on the way.The bosses:Each boss brings in their own flavour and elements to the story and game play, which is kind of good and makes missions less repetitive. The more outposts You liberate (not many, may be 4 to 5 outposts per boss) and more missions You complete (given by the natives), the more interest the local boss takes in You, taking you closer to defeat them.The Vehicles:A wide variety of Vehicles available, like trucks, vans, SUVs, boats etc along with the new addition of airplanes and helicopters, which can be used in free roam and missions.Guns for Hire:Basically 2 types:Type 1: CivilianEach civilian You rescue from the cults grasp during free roam can be used as a Gun for hire during next mission, until You release them. They ride with You, they can die for You, kill for You with guns blazing or with stealth. They can be found all over the map. No specialisations as such, good for regular gun fights.Type 2: Story AI CharactersThe other set of Guns for hire are the characters which are unlocked as You progress in main story. This set of Guns for hire are specialists and can be added to your squad. They can be called upon whenever You need them. There are 9 of these specialists which includes 3 animals and rest humans. The human specialists include a sniper, an airplane pilot, a helicopter pilot, a crossbow specialist (for stealth), a missile man etc. You can form a squad with them or call them in separately.Skills:Unlike prior instalments, skills in FC5 can be unlocked by finishing challenges. The challenges (which can be viewed in Map menu) needs to be completed to get reward points. These reward points can be used to unlock skills. Some challenges (for example) are get 10 kills with grenade, 8 kills with knife throw, 20 Melee kills, 5 road kills etc. So, higher the game difficulty, completing some challenges might get a bit difficult as game AI gets better.Skills are similar to FC3 and FC4, not many changes here. One difference I noticed is, no more crafting for weapon bag, loot bag, weapon holster etc by hunting animals for skins. This too needs reward points now. So make sure where You spend Your reward points well. Weapons:Anything and everything from a knife to arrow, pistol to assault and sniper rifles, from Grenade launchers to guided RPGs. If You have DLCs purchased too, You get martian weapons as well. You can carry upto 4 weapons at a time, provided You have unlocked the large weapon holster by using those reward points.Overall I would definitely recommend the game.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 7/10Attention to details: 6/10Thanks for reading the detailed review.

7;Action; 179,99;I've been a fan of Far Cry since the 3rd game, and was pretty excited for this one. I was not disappointed for the most part. As a fan of the series I have a lot to say about this game, so be preprared for a long read.PROS+ Looks amazing and is well optimized+ Soundtrack is great, including the radio songs+ Joseph Seed, the antagnoist, while not as good as Vaas or Pagan Min, is still good and really feels intimidating.+ Enemies actually have motivation and purpose, as opposed to the mindless pirates in FC3 or the braindead soldiers in FC4+NPCs have stuff to say now, they can tell you about locations, bases, hidden stashes, etc. Some even have conversations with each other that are fun to listen to, huge improvment from the old NPCs who were basically just there to be eaten by animals. The main NPCs are great and memorable too.+Lots more wildlife than the previous games, even have challenges to hunt them+Fishing is cool I guess, it's actually engaging and not an AFK activity like fishing in most games+ Planes and Helicopters are now in the game, and you can buy and customize vehicles instead of having to find them+ The bosses besides Joseph are more fleshed out and have their own methods and personalities.+ Companions are a new addition and are great, they never feel like a burden and can be instructed. Peaches is my personal favorite+ New resistance system is cool, you complete lots of varied activities in the world until you have enough points to face the regional boss and liberate the region.NEUTRAL~ I'm personally not a fan of the setting, I live in the U.S. so Montana isn't all that intersting to me, I'd much rather travel somehwere far away and exotic, however they do pull it off well, the atmosphere is great and I can see why people love it~ Co-op is an absolute blast however friends can't progress with you, you have to do each person's game twice~ Arcade is meh and most of the maps are player made and suck. Wish you could choose to only play Ubisoft mapsCONS- Hunting only yields you money, gone are the days of crafting upgrades, which is a huge shame, the old system was much more engaging.- Weapon variety is pretty bad, most weapons are just reskins of the same gun, even the unique weapons are identical to the standard versions, and they don't require anything to unlock, just more money, which is strange because the standard weapons are locked until you get enough resistance points, you can get the unique AKM before the standard one, it makes no sense at all.- Perks feel underwhelming compared to previous games.- Enemy planes and helicopters spawn way too often, feels more like a chore to kill them rather than and exciting battle.-No bladed melee weapons, I miss cutting people up with my machete/khukuri :(-Microtransactions for skins. Why was this necessary? It doesn't even cost much to unlock things with in-game money.Overall I think the game is good and definitely lives up to the Far Cry franchise, there are issues that bug me but they didn't ruin my experience. I think you'll enjoy this game, it's worth the full 60$, something that can be seldom said about games in this industry nowdays.;1;34,2;31/03/2018;847;28;;8.0
7;Action; 179,99;The Patriot simulatorI'll start with the bottom line: All in all, its 'yet another far cry game', similar to how FC3, FC4 and to some extent FC Primal look and behave.* Story (with no spoilers) - You're playing as a deputy who tries to arrest a cult leader that has taken control of a county in Montana. This cult is made of religious extremists who believe the end is upon us and they must 'cull the herd' aka kill the weak to save the strong and be ready for 'the collapse' which is their modern version of the biblical flood i guess.Things go to sh*t when trying to arrest him and you and your group end up in a gang-war type of scenario which you must survive till you find shelter. From there, the game actually begins just like any other FarCry game begins - You're saved by an npc that instructs you on how to start managing yourself in the map's sorroundings.Been there, done that.* Map - Roughly on the same size as FC3/4/Primal in terms of total size, but is much more condensed and has a lot more things to do in it. The game overall feels more of a GTA V's free roam when it comes to side-events that you find while traversing it. You will find lots of friendlies and enemies driving around and packed action is basically everywhere.events like hostage rescue are very common, as well as helping out npc's on the road with their random problems.* Followers - The game has added npc follower mechanic which works pretty well. You can add upto 2 specific followers with you and they can level up as they kill enemies to gain buffs. Most of these npc's are scattered across the world map and each has their own buffs, so finding new npc's as followers is a game of roulette that will either reward or screw you in terms of how good the followers will be. You have a total of 9 special followers that are story-bound, and countless of scattered npc's that can be used as random followers, which you can only 'store' up to 3 on your followers list. You can command followers to move to certain spots, kill specific enemies, and even revive you if you're dying. Long press to make them follow you again. Each follower has its own command key so they can do different things if you order them different actions.* Guns - You can have upto 4 gun slots in your inventory (3 big weapons + 1 sidearm) + 1 slot for melee weapons + your own fists which you can use at anytime with your actual weapon (similar to Duke Nukem's kicks in the classic game Duke Nukem 3D). There are a few dozens of weapons in the game, ranging between melee weapons, pistols, smgs, rifles, snipers, and heavy guns like lmg's and rpg's.* Skill tree - Works a bit differently than previous FC games. Its a mashup of badass ranks from Borderlands 2 and previous FC titles. Instead of steady xp gain, you get skill points on certain actions that you do, like completing missions and finishing world objectives and achievements. You spend the skill points on perks just like previous FC titles. All the ammo/holster upgrades are managed through this skill tree, so theres no more benefit in hunting animals for these kind of upgrades. Animal hides can be sold for money but that's it.* AI - Enemy's AI seems to have a small improvement from earlier FC titles. They will take more time to detect you and their aim wont be as punishing as previous FC titles (tested on the hardest difficulty). Follower's AI can be wonky at times, but overall its tolerable.* Arcade mode - An added minigame that lets you play with and against other people in 6v6 matches or in co-op mode against AI enemies like zombies/aliens/humans. There is also a feature that lets you build your own levels and play other people's levels.* Uplay - The obvious elephant in the room - This game has some issues with Steam, even if you buy it directly from Steam, since it forces you to have Uplay installed and tells you to create a Uplay account for it anyway. From my experience, there are a few issues while playing this game that you should be aware of, though your milage may vary:1) When opening and then closing the steam overlay in mid game, there is a slight chance (of about 20%-30%) that the mouse will stop responding. This has been confirmed to only happen in this game so its not a mouse issue. If this happens to you, tab out of the game and tab back in to fix it.2) The more annoying issue: When pressing shift+f2 to bring up the Uplay interface (the equalevant of the Steam interface), there is a good chance the windows' mouse cursor will appear (and stay stuck) in the middle of the screen until you quit the game (will start happening after leaving uplay's interface and going back into the game). The only proper fix i've found for this is to restart the game. Sometimes, switching to 'borderless' mode instead of 'full screen' helps, but its not a guarantee.3) You cant rebind the tab button, which means that if pressing tab in mid game, it will always pause the game and switch to the map view. Sounds nice, but since you can't rebind it, you have to put up with constant game interruptions if you want to shift+tab to the Steam overlay while already in a game menu, as doing this will unpause your game in the process. In other words, you will have to be aware to not be in an in-game menu screen when tabbing into the steam overlay.Im fairly suspicious that these 3 issues are caused deliberatedly by Ubisoft to make Steam users avoid playing the game via the Steam interface and encourage them to migrate into Uplay entirely.* Performance - The game runs at an avg of 80 fps in high-ultra settings at 1440p with Radeon RX 5700XT GPU and Ryzen 5 2600x CPU. No big frame drops seemed to appear and its overall well optimized in my opinion.As for the DLC's...Lost on Mars - A 6-7 hours campaign that puts you on Mars with Hurk. This is a really nice DLC with incredible graphics and superb futuristic weapon designs. Lots of action packed and overall highly recommended.Hours of Darkness - A 3.5-4 hours campaign that puts you on a Vietnam rescue mission. This DLC is quite disappointing as the objectives are very generic with no real incentive to explore the map. Its also fairly easy with the weapons they give you from the beginning. No sense of progress and all in all it feels really rushed.Living Dead Zombies - A very short 1.5 hours gameplay that is split between 7 micro stories that Guy Marvel is trying to form about (yet another) zombie apocalypse. You play the role of the hero in each of these stories and basically he forms them while you traverse it from the world he's building around you, similar to Borderlands 2's DLC with Tiny Tina (but with zero character build up). The DLC shows how Guy Marvel is trying to pitch 7 ideas to different producers for them to build a movie from.This is the most disappointing DLC of the bunch as it offers by far the least amount of content and priced the same as the rest. Give it a hard pass.So, which FarCry 5 version should you buy?The basic one. Period. I've bought the Gold one as i thought the 3 DLC's will give me lots of extra hours to grind on each, but the reality was that only the Mars DLC was worth it, both in terms of length and gameplay/story. Some other things i've recieved were free cosmetics and a few extra weapons and cars that pretty much screamed 'pay to win', alongside some fancy cosmetics. Since in game money isn't a big issue in the game, i simply can't recommend buying the gold version for these extra gadgets as you can buy them later on from vendors anyway.So to sum it up: Buy the base game and the mars DLC individually, when they're on sale. Pass on the rest.In summary:As said in the beginning, when you boil it all up, its basically 'more FarCry', which comes with all the good and some of the bad of the previous titles. So if you loved playing the recent FarCry games, you will sure love this, but it doesn't seem to add anything that is new to the formula.;1;80,2;2/05/2020;192;5;;5.0

7;Action; 179,99;"Far Cry 5As a person who played through Far Cry 1 to Far Cry New Dawn I can say that this series had it's own falls and rises. And Far Cry 5 stays somewhere in the middle. Anyway, let's get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Cool partner system.+ Decent story. It was interesting at the start, boring in the middle and cool at the end.+ Stashes with cash are mostly interesting to solve.+ Clutch Nixon's challenges are really cool to do especially with a friend.+ Planes and Helicopters are really fun and good addition to the game.Cons:- There are some funny additional missions but most of them are boring.- Most of the additional and even main characters feel poorly written and not interesting.- It's mostly a game with the same mechanics and I don't mind it in some way but why remove good mechanics? For example, you don't need to hunt animals anymore because they only give you money for their skins and not an upgraded holster, etc like in previous parts.- If you play co-op your friend will not complete the story on their character which is some straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because my friend literally couldn't level up skills because the requirement is to kill a boss who we killed but it counts only for the host and he couldn't even buy guns because in his story he didn't reach a resistance level for it. I give this game a 6/10.Far Cry New DawnAnd I want to give a quick review of this game here as I didn't play it on Steam.Pros:+ Cool aesthetic design for everything. Map, animals, bikers, guns. Guns are especially cool.+ Really cool animations on silent kills. Made me wanna say ""oof"" for that poor guy who I stabbed in the eye.+ Story is a sequel of course. Simple and good I would say. + Sorties are especially cool and even unique to the series. Capturing a valuable bag and getting out in many different places is what I really enjoyed. Cons:- Partners are even cooler and funnier here but sometimes I don't get how they are so weak to instantly die from a lvl 1 biker.- Kinda short for its price.I give it a 7.5/10 but buy it on a sale.";1;25,9;24/06/2020;457;11;;6.0
7;Action; 179,99;"I'm giving this a good review because I liked it and plan to play through it again for giggles, but I'm going to start by saying I don't think everyone will enjoy this.  Here's why I liked it:1.  Shooting mechanics are pretty tight and intuitive.  I know that's really basic, but if it's off in a FPS that just kills it for me.2.  I love the premise.  This setting and the idea of this game just jives with me.  I'm fascinated by prepper culture and cults.  Riding around in a pickup truck shooting guns at a bunch of psychos with my redneck buddies is just my idea of a good time.3.  They actually tried really hard to give this game personality.  Thing is there's not a lot of acting in the game, it's not an RPG, but what's there is really solid.  They took great pains to make it really look like Montana.  You will hate the villains and you will like the good guys (Poor Jess!). they did a lot with very little.  Also the soundtrack of this game is freaking amazing, and it looks really good.4.  I'm a working adult, I like games I can play for 20 minutes and get something done.  I also like story driven FPS.  This works for me.Here's why I think other people wouldn't like it:1.  Very, very loose approach to the narrative.  If you are one of those people who loses interest in a show when the characters do something that doesn't strictly make logical sense, or you lose your mind when you encounter a plot hole, you're going to hate this.  If you can just kick back and say ""it's just a game"", or make up the reasons in your head why something happened, (i.e. you have a strong suspension of disbelief like I do) you'll be okay.  But a lot of things happen that just don't make any sense, if that bothers you, you won't like it.2.  The multiplayer aspects didn't thrill me, though I like the Arcade feature, that one's good, the rest... meh.3.  The bullet drop with sniper rifles drives some people crazy.4.  A friend of mine who tried this thought it was more like an RPG, and while it has a few light RPG style elements, it's not an RPG.  It's a shooter with some character customization.I highly recommend you buy it on sale, even if it sounds good to you.   I mean I've played more money for worse games, but at least this way if you don't like it you're not out too much.";1;220,0;17/02/2020;171;7;;7.0

8;Action; 784,72;"DISCLAIMER: I hate Ubisoft's open world games to an exponential degree and as such I had no interest in W_D2. However following the word of mouth, I got into the game a few weeks back. This review is for people who were burned by WD1 or just interested people in general  PROS: +Adapts a wider colour palette for San Francisco, ditching the depressing Greyish tone from WD1 altogether.+The option of completing the entire game non-lethally.+A casual, more light-hearted story that is self-aware and reflects upon the current Internet culture, with wacky characters.+Character customization is more diverse as opposed to the first game's preset clothing.+Radio towers, a plethora of collectibles and outposts have been removed altogether. +You have a lot more options with hacking. Call the SWAT on a NPC or place him on a gang's hitsquad. Cause a static vehicle to accelerate forward much to the surprise of the driver. This culminates in what people call Emergent Gameplay.+Online activities like Bounty hunter, Invasions and Co-op operations lend to longevity.+PC Version is also a significant step-up from first one. Favours numerous graphics options and a FOV slider. CONS: -Unsatisfying Gunplay. Customization of firearms is barebones.-Basic Stealth system. Cover mechanics is janky AF.-Braindead AI.-Vehicles controlling is more arcade-y. but improved from the first game.-Some rather bland mission designs. (Go to X, Hack Y, Watch a cutscene, Mission complete) VERDICT: Watch Dogs 2 came as a surprise to me. It got rid of a lot of stuff that Ubisoft is infamous for and opted for a better game world, the result is a far superior product than the previous title. It's not an absolute ""OHMAGERD 10/10 GAYME HAS DOGES IN IT"" that some people claim it to be but Ubisoft is making the right changes in its IPs, albeit little ones. If anyone is still on the fence after WD1, give this one a chance, you'll be fairly pleased.";1;57,0;28/05/2017;576;15;;8.0

9;Action; 149,99;IntroductionThe last time I played the first installment of the Ghost Recon series was over a decade ago, so coming back to its successor felt naturally exciting. The differences between Wildlands and the original are vast. Thanks to that, I enjoy exploring the game more than I could ever hope for. This review will surely give you heaps of insight into the game, without a single spoiler.SummaryTom Clancy's Ghost Recon® Wildlands (GRW) is a PvE-focused military tactical FPS, where you assume the role of special forces operators, known as Ghosts, in a reactive and immense recreation of Bolivia to take down the savage drug organization known as the Santa Blanca Cartel. 😇Wins 💀Sins - Massive playable areas.- Diverse, detailed, and beautiful ecosystems with realistic weather conditions and day/night cycle.- Lifelike NPCs with schedules and practical actions.- Fully customizable Ghosts Squad.- Military role-playing.- Well-assorted weaponry and satisfying gunplay.- Sandbox gameplay.- Limitless replay value.- Playable without internet connection.- Accessible to casual, hardcore, and immersion-oriented players.- Seamless (for the most part) and unrestricted co-op experience.  - Unmemorable, no-stakes story.- Repetitive and predictable mission objectives.- Inactive PvP.- Seldomly unresponsive AI teammates.- The lack of tactical elements like camouflage, corpses interaction, disguise.In-depth AnalysisHow Open World Should BeGRW features 21 provinces inside eleven highly detailed and realistic ecosystems, making each visit to these areas feel like a whole new experience. From shallow swamps, open green lands, elevated forest valleys, lakes, waterfalls to snowy mountains. With the character creation available at any time, you can customize your whole squad - composed of Nomad (your playable Ghost leader), Midas, Holt, and Weaver (your AI teammates) - to alternate their appearances and fade into nature’s background. While most locations and the geography of the world are purely fictitious, a few recreated landscapes are based on their real-life counterparts, like the terrifyingly accurate Death Road, or the beautiful shallow salt lake Red Lagoon, and many more for you to explore. Although made up, all other locations still feel believable enough to be indistinguishable from real life, with NPC civilians all having proper interactions with each other and the environments, like celebrating in costumes, playing football, or simply swiping the floor. Watching them react is fun and intriguing, which is something I rarely enjoy in any other games. Sincerely, I think this fictional version of Bolivia has become my new standard of how an open-world game should be. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702247587Choose How to OperateSince the world is reactive with weather conditions, day/night cycle, along with enemies and civilians acting accordingly to their set daily routines, you too can choose how to handle them and use the environments to your advantage. Almost all cartel thugs, even the Unidad - dirty government soldiers - sleep and eat at night (except during special operations), making them vulnerable to a stealthy operator. During nights, enemies are harder to see, and so are you. It'd be wise to scout out the whole area using a binocular or a drone. With night-vision goggles equipped, you'll be the unseen ghost, silently striking enemies' bases when they are at their weakest. And operating in the dark during a thunderstorm or mist? That’s when the immersion hits through the roof!Or perhaps you’re just a casual player who wants to shoot bad guys and blow things up to have fun? Then, go loud, spray and pray with LMGs in broad daylight, when you can see everyone and become the spotlight for all guns pointing at you. Be warned though, as carelessly acting like that is not favorable in higher difficulties like Extreme, aka simulation mode. And for any hardcore, masochistic players or Ghost Recon old-timers out there, Ghost Mode with permadeath is awaiting to challenge you. Always planning, strategically maneuvering, paying attention to your surroundings, and being precise with your bullets are the keys to enjoying GRW. Playing on Ghost Mode, Tier One (increase the challenge, earn exclusive rewards) with Extreme Difficulty, and limited HUD (Minimap, Ammo, and Items shown only) brings me back to the punishing experience of the original game. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702252676Wide Variety of Guns to Choose and LoveGRW provides you with over a hundred firearms, with the option to carry one primary, one secondary, and one handgun, so choosing your favorite can be tough. Each gun is made distinct, not only on the model but also in the sound, both suppressed and unsuppressed. Bullet drop, recoil pattern, penetration power, and attachments contribute to that factor, too.Gunplay is easy to learn for the most part, but hard to master if you, like me, prefer to use sniper rifles and attack from afar. Sniping over 500 meters and watching the enemies confusingly running and hiding behind cover is amusing, as they are clueless to find you since the gunshot source is too far away from them to know where to look. But if you shoot loudly about 150m close to them, they will hear, react to your shot and try to run towards the sound, so don’t camp and be on your toes.That being said, sometimes they can magically spawn a vehicle to pursue you if you are too far away even though logically, they shouldn't know where you are, which ruins the immersion. Oddly, corpses disappear way too quickly, in under 30 seconds. The fact that you can't carry them around to hide or dump in a trash can where they belong to feels unpolished and lackluster in a AAA tactical shooter like GRW.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702271902Jolly CooperationGRW allows you to co-op with your friends or resort to public matchmaking to find randoms, so you can role-play together or have some dumbass ruin your plan by not communicating and exposing your position. The best thing about the co-op is that no matter where you and your friends are, all players’ progress contributes to each other. This means you can operate on one side of the map, while another player is at an airport over 15km away, to steal a resource plane and fly to the finish point. All of the players in the match will receive the same rewards.DLCsCheck out my Fallen Ghost review for more details.Technical 👾Bugs	 🖥️Specs 📊Performance - Visual glitches and sound stuttering in cutscenes and in-game.- Falling under the ground after exiting a helicopter in Co-op.- Crashed rarely, only about five times in my total playtime. - i5-10400F at 70°C- GTX 1650S 4GB at 77°C- 16GB RAM DDR4- HDD- 1080p- Win 11 Graphics settings: very high preset with ultra shadow, bloom and motion blur off.- Populated areas: 55 - 65FPS.- Dense jungle areas: 40 - 62FPS.- (Salt) Desert, mountains: 65 - 75FPS.Final rating: 8.5/10Overall, it’s a solid installment to the franchise. Without all the changes in this game compared to the original, I probably wouldn’t have had a memorable and immersive experience, with over hundreds of hours of role-playing as the Ghost and exploring this recreated Bolivia.

12;Action; 229,00;I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.I bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!Every single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??It's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!;0;587,4;4/08/2021;2192;72;;2.0
12;Action; 229,00;"Plagued by hackers, almost no oceania community, devs don't care, hackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still haven't been banned. Lazy.Edit: Wow this review got a lot more publicity than I expected! That being said, now that I've played a bit more I'd like to revise my initial thoughts. Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good game, the bullet ballistics are good, team work and strategy is good, the graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good. But all this is over-arched by critical flaws that I'm guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasn't likely to be as profitable as they were expecting. Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency. Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few ""specializations"" for each weapon, mostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things. The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers. They obviously knew their time wouldn't make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best. There's a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement. It's been abandoned, players don't get banned, reports don't get answered. If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield series, there's definetly fun to be had but heres a few tips:* Avoid official servers: that's right, the official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers. EA you should be ashamed.* Consider avoiding if you live in a remote area: In Australia today I was able to find just 1 conquest server with 40 players and able to at least play the game (10AM on a Wednesday). I really can't guarantee that there will be any player base if you live somewhere more exotic than Australia, USA and Europe are probably okay. Don't count on being able to find a server if you're a night owl like me.Overall this game had a lot of potential but it stands as a hollow shell of what it could have been. I liked the inclusion of female characters and being able to play as someone who I felt more of a connection to but the amount of hostility EA showed towards their player base was uncalled for and instead of making up for it they took the money and ran.";0;54,0;29/06/2020;1113;55;;2.0

Could have used more content to flesh the origin of Cal Kestis and his journey entirely. Introduction Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. It follows the story of Cal Kestis, a Jedi who survived order 66 by hiding in a planet as a scrap worker. It features elements from multiples sub-genres in the action category and incorporates them to elevate its gameplay further. From lightsaber combat to climbing and soul-likes bosses, the game grabs a bit from each of the best titles but not to the point those mechanics would obscure its own identity. Gameplay The combat is simple but also is a lot of fun. It has vast layers put into it that can appear rather lackluster at first. Still, they are intelligent choices from the developer. Cal Kestis has access to his lightsaber for physical combat and the force to open his options. Lightsaber techniques can range from throwing it towards enemies before it comes back. Different combos or forms, while the force can range from pushing back grenades towards enemies, force pulling, slowing enemies, and more.Players have a ton of options when facing the stormtroopers. You can push them off cliffs, throw them into one another, reflect beams at them, or cut them down with parries, to name just a few. It gives the player freedom to how they will approach any encounter with them or try new ideas. Hurl something at them, put them in front of their own blaster, forcing them towards you. The game has a lot of  possibilities.The platforming aspect of the game is also again, a successful decision in design. There are multiple ways to reach an objective on the map. For example, you can get to the next goal, die, take another path, and achieve that same destination. What is great about this is that those paths are very different when it comes to traveling itself and that they reward exploration. You can visit areas in the order you want, even as far as to go to planets you are not prepared for or discover secret places to visit later.It borrows aspects from games like Zelda, Metroid, Uncharted, Dark Souls. It then incorporates Cal Kestis mechanics into them to make them unique to the game. Puzzles and exploration being limited until you unlock new abilities, platforming that involves using the force to expand one's reach. Approach to level design, and finally combat that mixes dodging, parrying, smart use of the force and lightsaber combat.It is rewarding to be able to visit prior planets and discover that now you can take that path that was blocked before. Enemies being added in locations and exploring side stuff such as collectibles or hidden ways. Enemies have a defense meter, like a shield of sorts and until the player doesn't deplete that they won't be able to damage them. The combat is focused on reaction to how the player reacts to the enemy's attacks and groups of them. All of them have unblockable attacks, and bosses are ferocious with brutal powers and agile movements. Strong points The strong points are its story, that while it has some flaws, it is an enjoyable journey and manages to captivate what makes Star Wars so great as a franchise. The gameplay doesn't get boring because of new enemies showing up from time to time, keeping it fresh, along with the variety of options the player has. Bosses are exciting, particularly the last ones are hard to beat, and they give intense duels.The integration of elements from other games is a concept that I like. Bringing a more refined quality in gameplay but also being careful not to let those elements get to carried away and making the game into a copy of those other games. Finally, customization while the ponchos and ship can be some recolors. the lightsabers have a lot of customization into them. All colors are present except for red. you can change the hilt. The material, the handle, just about everything about them, and let's be honest lightsabers are very cool. It allows one to personalize the aesthetics of Cal Kestis to suit their particular tastes. Story The plot revolves around Cal Kestis, a young man who works to earn his living on a planet controlled by the empire. The plot follows up after the purge of the Jedi after order 66, and Kestis being a Jedi padawan, spends most of his days in hiding. One day, however, he is discovered by the empire. After escaping certain death, he ends up meeting Cere Junda, a former Jedi who managed to escape the Purge of Order 66 and the pilot Greez Ditus, the Mantis ship's owner.Without spoiling too much, the story is good, but both the beginning and the ending of it lack specific amounts of flesh. The start of the game is sprung while the end is abrupt. However, the rest of it is rich in detail, with information on the planets that you visit, references to famous characters and events. Good pacing that allows for character development and for the player to get to know these characters.The exploration of planets adds layers to the lore game, especially if you already heard of them before. The story has the premises of a Star Wars film. Comedic moments that can give a laugh or darker ones that can emanate conflicting thoughts or uncertainty of how things will play out. It is fantastic and one of the best aspects of the game. Some Notes The games run faulty on a GTX 1060. it runs okay in a GTX 1070 and anything above that it runs flawlessly. I could notice that in 1060, there were a lot of frame drops, so I would not recommend it for GTX 1060 users unless you don't mind playing in 30 FPS, which is less than ideal. There are also some bugs such as getting stuck in a wall or BD never turning off the scanner light, but those were few, rare instances.UPDATE: So users report the game doing well on a GTX 1060, while others said it has lots of frame drops. In our experience, the game did not run well on a 1060 but it did on a 1070. If you have a 1060, you will have to try it yourself to see if it runs well or not. Conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is probably one of the best games released in 2019. While the game doesn't manage to make something revolutionary or unique, it certainly knows how to add other elements and taking them into what Star Wars means. The combat, while simple, has a lot of freedom build into it, and the platforming-backtracking is excellent. Whenever you are a Star Wars fan or not, this is a game that you should consider getting.If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/";1;13,1;26/11/2019;954;49;;10.0
13;Action; 199,00;"Jedi Fallen Order is, by quite a big margin, the most surprising title of the year for me, not only compared to the expectations I had for it, which were admittedly pretty low, but for how genuinely brilliant this game achieves to be.It's true, Fallen Order really looks like a greatest hits of all the major and most appreciated mechanics we've seen in single player videogames in the last few years: we have bombastic cinematic moments took straight from the Uncharted series (if you played Uncharted 2, you'll probably find the first hour of the game to be hilarious, in that sense), tombs with puzzles to solve and walls to jump onto that seem borrowed from the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy, a combat system very similar to what we recently saw in Sekiro by From Software but, thankfully, they never end up falling in the ""been there, done that"" zone and they always feel extremely polished and cohesively combined, returning us a fantastic experience that is far more than the sum of its parts. The level design by Respawn is also top notch, with an intricate map design that is both a joy to explore in every corner the first time, in order to find secrets and hidden optional enemies, and fun to return to once you unlocked those abilities you were missing and that you can now use to reach places you couldn't get to before. The difficulty is well balanced and, at the hardest setting, it gives you a nice challenge without resulting too frustrating: this is definitely the difficulty to pick if you're experienced with action games like Sekiro. The story is coherent and serviceable, enriched by a cast of interesting characters you'll most likely want to know more about (sadly our main guy isn't one of them, that is the one thing that never changed from my initial impressions). On the technical side the game is also very solid, with great graphics and an extremely polished PC port. the only issues I encountered during my playthrough were all due to the integration with Origin, which is something they really can't drop soon enough. All things considered, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a brilliant game that everyone should at least consider playing, even if they're not particularly interested in the Star Wars universe (I'm not a massive fan of the saga myself). Great job, Respawn!";1;25,9;6/12/2019;479;28;;10.0

16;Action; 299,90;I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.

16;Action; 299,90;I've played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressive! And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law.;1;362,6;9/09/2021;847;11;;10.0

17;Action; 99,50;Lucid, Organic, and Raw.feel free to watch this review in video form<<< click meMax Payne 3 and its presentation make it one of the greatest shooters I have ever played. Many other first and third-person shooters come off feeling stiff and artificial, no matter how esteemed the Game or Gameplay. There comes the point where we, as players grow conscious, realise that we are indeed controlling hardened tough guys, protagonists who may or may not let the odd grunt slip out of their inanimate lips upon taking damage. Max Payne 3 has made me realise that our Gordon Freeman's and Master Chiefs all lack emotion. visual and verbal feedback informing the player that they control a person, a living human being. Not a bunch of code that lets us sit on the shoulders of our favourite video game protagonists. Games lack moments that humanise the characters on the screen, Moments that, if included in a Game's design, Story, and Gameplay, would help grow the assemblage of 1 and 0s that the developers are trying to sell to us into real people. Max Payne 3 has these moments, and that is what makes it great. The Game's presentation and Gameplay are a trip - Lucid, Organic, and Raw. Playing the Game feels like a dream, literally. Everything feels so real, is so real. Max's fluid animations blend seamlessly into one another, dynamically reacting to player input, making the Game feel authentic and visceral. I find it astonishing how gunplay remains smooth and intuitive despite being so heavily animated -  the shooting mechanics are some of the best I've seen to date. it's just so satisfying. Shooting someone isn't something that just happens - it's impactful. You won't see enemies merely rag-doll after being shot. they react to their injuries, clutching their wounds, squeezing their eyes shut with pursed lips. every death feels unique, with a weight that is felt. A life that Max and I have taken. Perhaps that's just the Game's masterful presentation talking as it imprints on my mind, adding depth and subtle details that may not be there at all. Admittedly levels feel claustrophobic, and the Game itself is exceptionally linear, with many areas and battle arenas feeling limited. It would've been nice to see more areas like the Nightclub and the Airport that offer more room to move around. however, the levels have benefited from this design choice and are extraordinarily detailed with incredible fidelity. That aside, Max is a man in pain. I got that much. However, you don't just see his pain in cut-scenes, but throughout the Gameplay. Many Games fail to convey how the protagonist feels during the most crucial part of any Game. the Gameplay. They abandon the emotion. it's only allowed for cut-scenes and dialogue, right? Wrong.Max doesn't walk. He pulls himself around, dragging his clunky feet, always moving nonchalantly - even when he leaps into the air, there's no grace to be seen. Max ends up falling to the floor like a pile of bricks - struggling, as he staggers back onto his feet. The youthful nature seen in previous instalments made you feel like Neo from the Matrix. Now, It's all gone.Max's movements. they're unhurried. he's tired, he's in pain. Max is now the one looking to buy more sand for his hourglass, or perhaps he's waiting for it to run out? He's hanging heavy, desperately hauling himself from altercation to altercation - shootout to shootout. Through his animations and mannerisms, you see all of this during Gameplay - the feeling of pain, a man whose entire being has shattered into billions of pieces. He's lost everything, and you don't just see this during a cut scene of Max drowning his soul in liquor. that depressing, painful tone is slathered all over the Game. That tone is why Max Payne 3 is my favourite out of the entire trilogy. Max Payne 3 has been one of the best gaming experiences I've had in some time. It's a Game I see myself replaying for its visceral nature, fluid animations and gunplay. Like many others, this Game is a sublime work of art—the story and storytelling - Max's character progression. Sadly, we won't see a Max Payne 4. it's a shame as I have not felt as invested in a character for a long time. James McCaffreys went above and beyond bringing this character to life.

19;Adventure; 99,50;This is hands down the best detective game I have played. I love the noire style, and all the characters are well thought out and well written. There are a few problems with the core mechanics of the game, but they do not get in the way of the story. If you get Widescreen Fixer to fix the 30fps cap, the game will run like butter. I've only encountered one game breaking bug with Widescreen Fixer and it was in an optional side mission, and you can always just toggle it off at that point in the game. Pros:-Great story-Fun gameplay-Good acting-Likeable, well written charactersCons:-30fps cap without Widescreen Fixer, and even that isn't a perfect solution-Some small, but noticable glitchesOverall: I definitely recommend this game, especially if you can pick it up on sale4/5;1;33,4;23/06/2017;219;5;;8.0

19;Adventure; 99,50;L.A. Noire is a detective game, simple as that. If you're looking for another shoot everything rampage game like GTA just because this game is made by Rockstar then this is not the game for you. Sure there is shooting, but you won't be allowed to kill everyone in sight, running people over will affect your case rating etc. The Atmosphere	  Personally, I love the setting of the game, the late 40s jazz theme mixed with golden age Hollywood as well as a classic noir feel makes for a great mix, but while the storytelling is good, it's not all there. The story feels a bit like it's jumping around without finishing everything off, Rockstar gathered enough story for a movie, but not a 20 hour game. Because of this you will be left with extra things that feel like they are just there to fill up an hour of your time and parts of the story that are never properly concluded. This being said, the story has some great parts towards the second half of the game and does a great job 80% of the time, however the ending will feel incomplete.  Gameplay and Fun	 It's fun to drive around and using your siren to move people out of the way is great. The car chases are exciting at first but end up being repetitive, as with all the chases. Shootouts feel this way too and there are one or two that will feel boring. The combat tends to feel stiff from time to time. For an open world game it is very linear and the free roam mode itself actually takes some working out to access. Street crimes are fun to attend to and interrogations are challeging. The clue finding in the game is brilliant and walking around the crime scenes never gets old although you will quickly work out the set structure to finding all the clues. Sound	 The sound in the game makes for great immersion, no complaints here really. The hint sounds at crime sounds can be turned off if they make the game too easy and the whole feel of the sirens and the radio really sells the 40s atmosphere. Graphics	 The facial expressions are the best part about the graphics, I didn't notice too many hiccups in the graphics and if I did they didn't distract from the game. The faces of people look incredibly lifelike and all the other graphics are good too. The sunny setting of Los Angeles adds a bright feeling to the game. Replayability	 While you do have the option to replay your cases to get all clues and perfect your interrogation this game is likely to be one you will only play the story of once, it's still fun to drive around and do street crimes but the cases tend to be something that's best as a one time thing. Verdict	 Overall this game is great fun and a nice step away from GTA while still keeping to the Rockstart format. It feels fresh but also familiar. The graphics look very good for a game that came out in 2011. You will feel very immersed in the time period through use of sound and surroundings. The open world side has something to be desired and Los Angeles doesn't exactly feel as alive as GTA 4's Liberty City or Watch Dog's Chicago, it doesn't have much of a personality, the characters do. If you're looking for a good open world game, this isn't it, if you're looking for a good story with a mix of puzzle and regular shoot/drive gameplay and well designed characters then this is it. Get this if: You like a good story You want diverse gameplay that makes you think You like the Noir settingDon't get this if: You want full freedom in an open world You want to go on a killing spree You don't care about story  8.5/10;1;20,5;2/11/2014;201;6;;8.0

21;RPG; 199,90;"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.";1;145,7;16/02/2022;5241;86;;10.0

21;RPG; 199,90;"I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 2 years later... I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch. I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 1 day later...I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.2 days later...I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam. just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. Present day... This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!Some thoughts:This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. P.S.Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.";1;73,0;28/09/2022;616;10;;10.0

22;Adventure; 55,99;I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.Real decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.But instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.Some really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.Also some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.You also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). But piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.If there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.Some people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.The real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.So if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.It does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.However, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.Not sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.Maybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.Is it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.People complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.;1;47,8;13/11/2018;351;5;;8.0

22;Adventure; 55,99;I thoroughly enjoyed Thronebreaker, and give it a full 10/10. It's really quite brilliant.The writing is superb, and the voice acting really brings the story to life.As for Gwent, well, it's much improved over the original Witcher 3 version, and the battles in Thronebreaker are tailored to fit the story, with special cards and rules. I rarely got bored in the 55 hours it took me to finish.Make no mistake, this is another epic tale from the Witcher universe, and I highly recommend it.......but a couple of things worth knowing before you buy:1. Witchers feature very little in Thronebreaker. This is more a story of rulers and their armies.2. If you buy Thronebreaker on Steam, you can't unlock the perks in Gwent on GOG. You'll need to buy the GOG version to do that. (Edit: Gwent is now available on Steam);1;59,0;19/05/2019;94;4;;10.0

22;Adventure; 55,99;I went into this game completely blind, knowing nothing about it. At the time of writing this I have 10 hours of play time. 8 of those were from the day i got this game in one long session.  I will update this as I go further through the game, even though no one cares and no one will read this.I don't know how long this is going to be but just in case TLDR: The game is good. But not perfect. The story is fantastic, giving you the details of what happens outside of the stuff you play in the main Witcher games. The actions you choose throughout the game effect the gameplay and story. The effects of your decisions become apparent at a good enough pace to keep you interested. Even some of the most mundane decisions that you think wont have any effect, will change the game. The voicing is done very well and feels real and with emotion.The gameplay is split into two parts, traversing the map and the gwent. The map traversing is fun, the art style is beautiful and suits the game very well. When traveling the map you loot and fight random encounters. There are treasures to find and points of interest that can affect your gameplay and story. My one gripe with this part of the game is the slow movement speed, which is expensive to upgrade.Gwent is main part of this game. Don't like gwent, sucks to suck this game isn't for you. The gwent in this game is a dumbed down version of the Gwent in the Witcher 3 and the standalone Gwent game. You only have two rows of cards to play. Other than that the mechanics are similar if not the same. At the start of the game your freedom of deck style is limited but as you advance it expands. Your actions in the story will have an effect on your cards. Cards can be taken away or added depending on your decisions and how the game goes. The camp system is where you can buy upgrades, train new cards, configure your deck, do practice matches and talk to the people in your party.  Every system here works well and adds to the game. Conclusion: This game is really good. For me it has very few flaws, an intriguing fluid plot, and fun casual gameplay. This game requires patience if you want the best experience, and can be frustrating at times when you cant get past a battle or a puzzle. If you are a fan of the Witcher series, especially the story, this game is for you.Why the hell did I write this. No one will read this everyone knows the game is good. Oh well someone hire me as a reviewer despite my garbage writing skills.Update 1: 43 HoursSome of the battles and puzzles are disproportionately hard. I have been playing on the hardest difficulty throughout my playthrough. Due to my actions I've lost a lot of good characters. Taking the middle path between good and evil can sometimes be worse than being evil. Multiple times I have gotten furious at this game. I am writing this after a battle that took be almost 2 hours to beat. Upgrading your camp is way more important than I thought, and I hate myself for being so charitable throughout the game.Update 2: End of The GameI got one of the good endings. It was pretty cool. But I have another complaint about the game. WHERE THE HELL WAS GERALT. Yes I understand this game is about Meve and the Nilfguardian war. But it is still a Witcher game, and especially when Geralt is shown on the cover art of the game how are you gonna have him pop up for just one scene. It was cool to get some backstory about him, but I am a bit sad. I freaked out when he appeared, and cried when he disappeared. Awful game -120/10. Not enough Geralt. I would not play this game again in the near future. At some point it got a bit tedious.;1;45,3;22/05/2020;60;12;;8.0
22;Adventure; 55,99;CDPR did it again, they proved that it's not the budget that defines a good game, and that Geralt is not the reason why the Witcher universe is so successful and enjoyable to dive in. Thronebreaker is standalone single-player card game in the Witcher universe, where there are no good choices, only different shades of grey. It's definitely not as huge production as the Witcher 3, but for its price I can definitely say that CDPR didn't disappoint, it's probably the best single player card game I've ever played, with strong story, good design, a lot of puzzles to solve and synergy strategies to put in use. Nothing here feels forced, rushed or neglected, the game is very enjoyable at its core and I can recommend it for everybody who liked the gwent mini-game from Witcher 3, let alone fans of card games, since for them this is a mandatory position.I'm not a huge fan of card-based games myself, but I did enjoy the one in Witcher 3, and I enjoyed this one even more. Thronebreaker is a very solid position with a rich story, something that I didn't know was possible considering its card game genre, but CDPR once again proved that they don't accept anything else but a masterpiece in its perfection. I admire them for the work put into even the smallest details, something a lot of other game studios could learn from, as playing games like these is a pure pleasure for my mind.Good job CDPR!;1;95,6;25/12/2018;82;2;;10.0

23;Action; 16,99;I got this game on a sale for 1.49 EUR and it was the best deal ever, it turned out to be amazing. It's not for everyone however, as it's quite long, you need to pay attention to the story and get used to the clunky combat - you'll either love it or give up in the first few hours.I started the game to see what it's like, struggled with the fighting, played half an hour until it suddenly crashed and I realised I didn't save the game. I didn't really like what I saw first, but I decided to give it another chance. Fortunately, the dialogues are skippable, so I could continue almost immediately and this time I read the tutorial more attentively and managed to find out how to properly kill enemies. As the story progressed, I got more and more into it and started to enjoy the game very much.GraphicsEven though the game came out in 2007, it's beautiful. The environments are detailed, colourful and interesting, most places are not just visually but aesthetically pleasing. Heck, even some dark crypts and caves look exquisite here and there due to the nice colours and great lighting.GameplayWhen you start the game, you have to choose a style you want to play it in, and you still have the opportunity to change this anytime. You can have an isometric camera or OTS, so you can play point and click style, and also in third person if you want to (I chose the latter). Being inexperienced with RPGs, I played on easy. My character became pretty strong eventually (maybe too strong for this difficulty), yet there still were a few challenging parts to balance that out.As you play, you gain XP and level up. While meditating, you can access the skill tree, which looked a bit complicated at first, but it makes perfect sense. Alchemy is pretty useful, especially for bigger fights, I haven't used any bombs though.The gameplay is not particularly interesting on its own, the story is what makes it special. Sometimes there's a lot of running back and forth, collecting things, which gets boring after a while. I was very grateful for the few fast travel options we got.On the other hand, there are lots of side quests to keep you busy. Some of them are of the general collect-this-and-I-reward-you tpye, and there are more important ones as well. Some side quests enrich the story a lot and have an overall impact on how you experience it, so it's definitely worth completing those.CombatIt's doubtless that this is the low point of the game. The first time I saw Geralt grabbing a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I laughed out loud, I thought it was a bug. (Later though as I applied more talents on the swords, he became a much better fighter.) To evade attacks you need to dodge by pressing one of the direction buttons twice or more times, depending on how responsive it wants to be in the current situation, I had some trouble sometimes when Geralt got cornered. To attack, you need to click on the enemy and do not click again immediately, doing so will cancel the attack. Only click again when the cursor changes, allowing you to do combos if you click in time. It definitely takes some getting used to.Collect as much information as you can on the enemies you have to face, it's important to read the Journal, especially the pages on Monsters to learn what they're immune to, where they can be found, which fighting styles are efficient against them. It helps you a great deal. The Signs are very useful and fun, too.The controls during combat are pretty awkward sometimes, even if I had the right fighting style selected, I couldn't attack or hurt the enemies. I had to switch to another style and then back for it to decide to work again.StoryAfter the low point, here comes the best part. The story in this game is incredible. It's very detailed, very deep and exciting. The dialogues are filled with humour and deep philosophical thoughts here and there.The world is consistent, the characters are likeable and unique, after a while you find yourself caring about many of them. They all respond to your actions and choices. There's quite a number of decisions you have to make that (sometimes pretty heavily) affect the story and your relationship to certain characters. I loved the amount of freedom I had in the game, I was never forced to get in an intimate relationship with any character or play dice, etc. - it's entirely up to the player.The way women were portrayed though - boobs, boobs and more boobs. I've seen more boobs in this game than my own. :P Jokes aside, I simply had to play very carefully when others were in the same room with me, because almost every woman you can interact with is um... underdressed. Good for Geralt I guess. .)As you play more and more, the story just drags you in - even if you don't like the combat or the gameplay, it's definitely worth to play this through just for the story alone.Animation and voicesThis is something I wasn't entirely pleased with. Yes, it's not a game from today, but the characters often looked very stiff, which is not a good thing when there's a lot of dialogue. Another thing which detracts from the experience is the mediocre voice acting. First I found it very awkward, but got used to it eventually and after a certain point it simply didn't bother me anymore.(I kept finding the same character models throughout the game though, now that did annoy me a bit.)Music and atmosphereThe music was pretty great, fast paced and dark when needed, beautiful and calming while exploring beautiful areas. It really spiced some great moments up. Same with the atmosphere, the time of day really sets the mood of some locations, as well as the occasional rain and storms.I also loved the art style, there's some gorgeous artwork during storytelling parts.Summary:+ nice visuals+ amazing story with brilliant dialogues+ great music and atmosphere- combat might be hard to get used to- bad animationsIt took me 46 hours to finish the adventure and it's become one of my all-time favourite games. If you can get used to the combat and want to take a break from no-brainers, I highly recommend The Witcher, it's going to be an amazing and unforgettable experience.;1;50,2;30/04/2015;1368;80;;8.0
23;Action; 16,99;Should you still play the Witcher 1 in 2020? That’s a fair question to ask, considering that this game is now 13 years old with its release in October 2007.  Cons With a game that is 13 years old, it’s clear that its age will show in some aspects. One of these is the outdated  graphics  . (Especially if you play without any mods, like I did). Also, there aren't a lot of different character models for the NPC’s, so you will encounter a lot of clones. Personally, this didn’t bother me that much, but it may be distracting for some players. The game has a  slow start  . In the beginning, you may find yourself annoyed by the point and click combat or the slow start to the story. But I will promise you, the game really does get better the further you get. After some time, I even found myself enjoying the combat, I just needed to get used to it.The Navigation  was a bit frustrating. It’s really annoying how often the direct way is blocked so you have to walk all the way around, even though you can already see your destination. There is no fast traveling.  During some parts of the game, you can teleport to certain locations, but that doesn’t change the fact that 40% of your play time will just be walking around from one place to another, which can feel a bit annoying at times, especially considering the amount of backtracking needed if you really want to finish all side quests and contracts. Fighting feels very clunky.   There is no active dodging, and if you get stunned when fighting more than two enemies, you can proceed to grab a cup of tea while watching said enemies slowly beat Geralt to death because no matter how frantically you press your keys, you will not get out of that situation. There is no animation cancelling.   Animations have to finish before you can start doing something else. After you drink a potion or eat something, Geralt has to stand still for the whole duration of the animation before you can move or drink another potion. This may be intended but feels unnatural and a bit clunky. Every normal person can move while drinking, especially while being chased by monsters. But our Geralt here is different. He likes to drink his potions in peace of mind, as if he has all the time in the world, not minding the monsters attacking him while doing so. If you play on normal difficulty,   the game will be too easy   , especially later on. The only boss fight that felt challenging to me was the Chapter 1 boss fight, because I hadn’t levelled my Aard sign at all (note that with levelled Aard sign, it is also very easy). But the later boss fights, especially the final ones in Chapter 5 and the epilogue, are way too easy if you know how to use alchemy and signs. Because of that, I recommend playing the game on the hardest difficulty and not on normal difficulty.Also, you can’t pick up loot during combat. The game makes you wait around 3 seconds after combat finishes before you are allowed to pick something up. In conclusion   , the negative points mostly concern the lack of convenience we are used to from newer games. Most of these points only caused me minor frustration and didn’t stop me from playing and enjoying the game. ProsIt’s worth discovering how  the story  of the Witcher games started, because it’s a great, immersive story. For someone who read all the books and already played Witcher 3, it was a great experience to discover how the games continue to develop the story from the books.  The world  . The world of the Witcher is grey and cruel, but it’s also rich in lovable and humorous characters and filled with a lot of lore to discover. Most characters are layered and have good reasons for their actions. almost no one is just evil for the sake of being evil but rather convinced that what they are doing is the right thing.   The choices   you make affect the story. A lot of times, there are various outcomes to a quest based on your decisions. The world isn’t simply black and white. The developers stayed true to Andrzej Sapkowski’s notion of “Choosing the lesser evil” from the books. Even though the most canon choice is to stay neutral in the conflict presented in the game, it is up to the player if he wants to side with one of the two factions (Sco’iatel or Order of the Flaming Rose) or not.  The soundtrack  : This game has one of the best video game soundtracks imo, the music helps creating an immersive atmosphere. The levelling system  : You can personalize the combat by putting skills in magic signs, alchemy, bombs or the different sword styles.  Combat tactics : I love the fact that you have be tactical in combat and that alchemy and signs actually matter. In order to deal damage, it is crucial to pick the right sword (silver for monsters and steel for humans), the right style and to use the right potions. You can’t just mindlessly slice through enemies  play time  : There are a lot of things to do in the Witcher, there are a lot of side quests, contracts and trophies. If you don’t plan on rushing the main story, you have around 50 hours of content.  Price:  I picked it up for like 1-2 Euro on sale, and the amount of content you get for the price is amazing.  Conclusion  The worst part of this game is definitely its controls and the general inconvenience, which may make it feel like a slog to some players. But if you manage to get used to that, it’s still a very good game with a great world and story. I recommend the game to everyone who isn't too bothered by aged controls and I think it's still worth your time to play this game in 2020.  “Evil is Evil. Lesser, greater, middling… Makes no difference. The degree is arbitrary. The definition’s blurred. If I’m to choose between one evil and another… I’d rather not choose at all.” ― Andrzej Sapkowski, The Last Wish;1;62,8;13/10/2020;408;6;;5.0
23;Action; 16,99;When I first played The Witcher, I was in middle school and I had pirated the game. Like most middle schoolers, I wasn’t very smart and the only thing I really looked for in a game was how many bad guys I could murder. I finished the game and quickly forgot about it. Only after I was in college did I realize to the full extent the awful choices that I had made during my first playthrough of The Witcher. My crimes were beyond description. I killed street dogs and innocent travelers just to loot 2 orens worth of stuff from their corpses. I slept with women and promptly abandoned them to be murdered by angry mobs or overzealous knights. I killed a fellow witcher. I walked away from a chance to have a happy family with a woman who loved me in order to sleep with my sex buddy sorceress who I thought looked hotter. I helped commit mass genocide, murdering dozens of non-humans fighting for freedom.By chance I happened to see The Witcher: Enhanced Edition on sale during Steam Summer Sale 2014. I took it as a sign from heaven. Lord Gaben the Redeemer was speaking to me through my computer, offering me a chance to atone for my sins of the first playthrough. Now I could do what I had not done in middle school. I would uphold justice and help the weak. I would be the hero that Vizima needed, but not the one it deserved. And I could do it with 75% off. I clicked buy and my $1.99 ascended to the heavens while the face of Lord Gaben smiled down upon me.;1;58,0;28/08/2014;1258;792;;2.0
23;Action; 16,99;"Many think this game was bad, it's not. What people really mean is, ""this is from 2008 and I don't like that.""Each of the three games had their pros and cons. The combat is a con for most folks but its really not that bad. You have to use certain sword styles against different opponents and you have to time your mouse clicks to keep the combo going. The difference being, in W2 you have to time your clicks but style doesnt matter as much and in W3 you just left click until dead or spin to win. The alchemy portion is probably the best of the three. You have to learn your ingredients from books or people otherwise you just cant make your potions, and you absolutely need alchemy to survive. In W2 and W3 alchemy is great but the only thing you need to win is Cat and Swallow. The story of W1 is wonderful you meet so many great characters that come back throughout the series and you can see how the relationships Geralt has made have lasted over the years. The main story is long, in depth, and very interesting. You begin to slowly unravel the mystery of the Wild Hunt and the White Frost. The politics are ever present as well. Geralt always seems to find himself at the court of kings and you can learn about the political turmoil brewing in the region as Nilfgard starts to breath down the necks of Redania and Temeria. All in all, don't just write this one off as aged garbage. If you are truly a fan of the series and the lore its a must. There are even small hints at subplots throughout the series that will reward you for playing them in order. I hope you enjoy the Witcher as much as I have.";1;62,0;25/06/2017;229;3;;8.0

23;Action; 16,99;"The Witcher: Utterly brilliant, but rough and over-ambitiousThe first game in The Witcher series has often been called a ""rough diamond"", so my title doens't tell anything new. This review was wrtten just a couple of days before the release of The Witcher 3, and without having played The Witcher 2 yet. This way I hope to be able to look at the original game in the series with fresh eyes, not with the hindsight of the other games somewhere in the back of my head. It's also important to notice that this review addresses the final release of the game, from september 2008, i.e. The ""Enhanced Edition: The Director's Cut"". This version represents the developers' final thoughts and ideas on the game, and it differs considerably from any other version.In this game, the player takes the role of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher or a professional monster-slayer. There is no character-build menu, no fancy options about hair-colour or the width of your eyebrows. You are Geralt of Rivia, you are a Witcher. And to put it simple: the game is so utterly brilliant since it manages to let you believe that, almost from the start. Seldom have I felt so deeply connected to the character I was playing: after a couple of in-game hours, I started to think as Geralt, react to my surroundings as Geralt, even feel like Geralt: I was completely involved, the game got deep under my skin, I was bewitched. It's not that I played the game for hours and hours on end, or that I played through the night, no: it's more like I felt Geralt had become part of my life, not only while in-game, but also while not playing. I started to look for articles and websites to read about The Witcher and its world, and I even dreamt a couple of times about the game and its characters...The game's greatest strengths: the world, the story, the choicesAs is commonly known by now, the Polish developer CD Project Red started working on The Witcher – actually their first game – out of love for the books, novels and stories by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Sapkowksi is the author of The Witcher-universe: a collection of books and stories about a fictional, fantasy-world with a profound background and a history all of its own. Sapkowski has often been called ""The Polish Tolkien"", and while that might be too big a compliment, I often felt like I was part of a world that could hold its own against Tolkiens incredible rich universe. And I suppose that explains why I felt so connected to the game and so deeply involved: the world of The Witcher did already exist before the game, and is completely coherent and believable by itself.It is one thing to have an interesting world to build a game in, it's another to write and develop a story within this world that works well for a role-playing game. The story of The Witcher however succeeds brilliantly in keeping the player's interest. It is ambitious, full of twists and unexpected turns, but it stays believable right up to the end. The different characters, both Geralt and his main protagonists, are complex and multi-layered: hardly anyone in this world is just ""good"" or ""evil"": most of the time, its a mix of both, often with one or several other characteristics  added. The game does a fantastic job in introducing the player (Geralt) to this world, using an old trick: after having lost his memory, Geralt has to rediscover not only the places, the stories and the people, but he has to rediscover himself: he has to give himself a place in the dark, conflict-ridden world he lives in.The main way to do this, is by making choices: the game's strongest point by far is the feeling you get that the decisions you make actually matter, and do influence the flow and even the outcome of the story. This is especially impressive since almost every choice, from minor to very important, is difficult and hardly clear-cut. The games offers tons of dialogues, more than 5000 lines of text to be read and/or said, but very seldom did I feel like doing the ""good thing"". In most cases, the situation was so dire or the possible answers so gruff, that I had a hard job to make decisions that felt ""right"" at all. It was more like ""trying to do my best, and hoping for the best"", since often decisions or roads taken early in the game, proved to have unexpected consequences (much) later on. The way in which this game manages to make me think about good and evil, about morality and consequences, is utterly and completely brilliant.The game's problem: it tries too hard to be the best rpg in the worldFrom whatever angle you look at it, it is obvious that The Witcher is a very, very ambitious game. The developers made no secret of it that, even back in 2007 when they were almost unknown, they wanted to make ""the best rpg ever"". Ambition definitely is a good thing for any developer, it can also be a trap. While CD Project Red succeeded brilliantly with everything story- and character-related, they paid dearly in some other departments. The actual gameplay, the movement and combat, form the game's biggest downfalls. As a matter of fact, lots of people have tried the game, only to leave it after running into frustration with the combat system. Combat is an exercise in rythmical feeling: by clicking at the right moment, Geralt can chain attacks together so that they become much stronger. Fast clicking is of no use whatsoever, as is blocking or parrying since the game takes care of that.Moreover, Geralt has two different swords (steel for humans and animals, silver for monsters) and three differend combat styles (strong, fast and group style) at his disposal, so choosing the right weapon and the right sword for any fight is an important issue. Combat is much more tactical than in most rpg's, and since dozens of alchemical potions, lots of special coatings for either of your swords, six magical signs and even some bombs are thrown into the equation as well, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by this avalanche of ideas. Still, when one is prepared to play the game slow, with lots of attention to the myriad of entries in the journal (on quests, people, monsters, alchemical ingredients, recipes or locations), the sense of fulfillment can be enormous. This is most of all true of the alchemy, which is a very important part of the game. It takes a time to get the hang of it, when once mastered, it proves very rewarding.Final thoughtsPlaying and mastering The Witcher felt like climbing a mountain: it takes time, patience and commitment, even preparation, but once everything gets going, the long way to the summit becomes a joy by itself. In the case of the first game in the series, the mountain definitely is not Mount Everest nor even Mont Blanc, and the path is littered with dangerous spots and possible downfalls, but the scenery is gorgeous nonetheless, and the journey towards the summit proved one I won't ever forget.Gameplay: 25/30 (provided one takes the time to master the combat system)Graphics: 16/20 (the game looks brilliant for its age)Sound: 8/10 (the music is fantastic, the voice-acting is not)Technical stability: 9/10 (I got no crashes whatsoever with this final edition)Steam integration: 7/10 (like any older game, it comes without cards or achievements)Game for the money: 9/10 (it's a very long game, but it's not an open-world sandbox)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall Score: 84/100";1;80,2;15/05/2015;279;11;;8.0
23;Action; 16,99;Combat is not as bad as you have heard, but then again i grew up in the 80's and 90's so ive seen worse, and enjoyed worse! I actually like the combat, it is different from anything i have played in over 10 years. For a dollar and some change?!?!?! seriously? why would you complain?!?!?! there are so many games for this same price that are shallow and boring, this has depth and more than 40 plus hours to play. Multiple crashes, not SLI freindly at first. But after the intro (about 20 min) no crashes at all.  let's be honest, its a good game. I LIKE IT. BUT you have to treat games like a new girlfriend:  they are all different and you have to figure out how they work. ONCE you do this it is enjoyable. I see far too many people expecting it to be like witcher 3....it is not. Its not supposed to be. But seriously its a dollar and some change: give it a shot! if you don't like it why complain? I have paid full price on tripple AAA titles that were far worse. If you can throw a buck fifty for a soda pop, why not pick up something that will last hours and hours.;1;80,5;31/05/2017;164;5;;8.0

23;Action; 16,99;The Witcher manages to be one of the best RPGs that I have played in spite of many little flaws. There are times the game will frustrate you in minor ways, and yet the game deserves the cult classic status it enjoys. The story is dark and engaging,   the world is deep and lore filled, and the moral ambiguity will have you racked with doubt about the choices you have made. But make no mistake, you will make choices in this game, and you will have to bear the responsibility those choices bring.If you dont mind working through a clumsy interface, and like a game that makes you work for it: The Witcher: Enhanced Directors Cut may be the game for you.See my full review here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSb1Z380XCM;1;76,1;19/04/2015;251;4;;8.0

24;RPG;00,00;Gwent is a card game but you can't compare it with any other cardgame out there, like Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra or Magic. It's very unique in gameplay and has almost nothing in commen with the Witcher 3 Gwent you can play with the ingame NPCs.If you play Gwent, it feels very tactical and not luck based at all compared to the others. I am a big fan of card games and I played almost every game of this genre. Nothing kept me playing it like Gwent does, even after years. This game is very well made. The grafics and the animated cards espcally, but even the gameplay is very balanced und fluid. If you already played few online card games, you probably know you have to pay alot of money to get good decks, but not here. In Gwent you can easly craft your first few good decks after couple of weeks playing, without ripping of your whole wallet.I already loved playing Gwent with the Witcher 3 NPCs, even tho this version was very crappy. CD Project Red took this idea out of the game and made a whole new standalone version. I played it since release in March 2017, and since then they made a ton of changes and reworked the whole game multiple times. I never expirienced a developer who put so much love and work into a online card game after release and I am a bit sad that this Game is so unbelievable underrated. This is the only game i feel like I could play it until the last day of my life. I hope it's community keeps growing and the devs keep it alive <3//I already got 448 hours ingame time on GOG Galaxy, I just recently started playing it on steam;1;174,8;15/01/2022;203;5;;10.0

24;RPG;00,00;"Whew, here we go, I will subdivide in topics because it will be a long ride: I have +2200 hours of Gwent on GOG and over 300 confirmed kills (?).I play Gwent since the open beta and I consider myself a ""semi professional"" player (I play tournaments and Pro Rank since forever and doing top 500 lately, maybe 200 if I push hard)Important disclaimer to start:This game is not the Gwent of Witcher 3, its massively more deep and complex, and better of course. Only thing they have in common is you play for points and best of 3 rounds.Skill, Consistency and Less RNG:Gwent is objectively the card game in which the RNG matters less, and arguably, skill matters most. It is all about CONSISTENCY.Why is this? Not only because cards themselves have effects that are not random in their majority, but because of how deck sizes and draws work:- Your deck has 25 Cards- You draw 10 at the beginning of the game, with 2 or 3 mulligans.- On round 2, you draw 3 more, and have 2 more mulligans- On Round 3, you draw 3 more, and have 2 more mulligans.So, I won't do all the math but as you can see, you have a very high chance of getting the cards you want or at least the ones you need to execute your gameplay. This is a HUGE difference from other card games in which your deck is huge and you are drawing 1 by 1 hoping to get what you want (thus, rng of the draw affecting a lot more because of this)The other thing about the skill intensiveness Gwent has, is that there is no mana, so you can play ANY card at ANY given turn. This opens you to A LOT of possibilities, which makes the game harder to master IMO and a lot more harder to analyze and play correctly or optimally.This is amazing if you are looking to smash your brain into the game and feel excited about playing WELL and winning by 1 point (that happens A LOT), BUT, can be a bit overwhelming also, making it a game that doesn't shine THAT much on casual play and that can get you brain-tired easier than other games in which you are just stomping the mana curve at the beginning.SettingThe art and the universe, well, it's the Witcher, if you like dark stuff you will love it, if you want some funny and light hearted stuff, you won't like it. I find it very appealing personally, but sometimes its too dark and can drag you down a little bit. Anyway it's awesome for the most part, and also very mature.Generosity (NO P2W)Gwent is the most generous digital card game ever. Period. You can analyze the numbers and you will see it.Even LoR being generous, Gwent just goes over the top with it. You will have a Tier 1 deck in no time playing this game without paying, I can guarantee it.DevelopmentWell this is the roughest spot of Gwent. While CDPR is a great company that made great games, for Gwent it is lacking a bit. I mean, they hear the community for sure and deliver some balances here and there to fix things, but the patches are always messy (with bugs), some balance decisions are very questionable (but they later fix them), but for the most part, aside of some specific things, the game is always enjoyable and well balanced.Gwent as an EsportCompetitively speaking as an Esport, the circuit is nice, but can be improved. There are qualifiers every month in which the top 64 of the pro ladder compete for places on Gwent Open, an event in Poland that they pay your travel to and can win some nice money. Obviously reaching there is VERY HARD but it can be made, and grind is not the only thing that matters. Aside from this official circuit, there are plenty of tournaments organized by the community, in which sadly I would like CDPR to get involved more (so we can have money prizes) but that still doesn't happen. Anyway they are fun, the people is great, there are streaming coverage, and nice ingame prizes.CommunityCommunity is nice, aside from the same trolls as all games has on reddit and such, for tournaments all the big teams are very nice and open, there are many videos with information and stuff to help new players, and many of tournaments iniatives made by the community (on english and even on spanish too)ConclusionFor real, on Gwent, SKILL matters, and don't take it from the AD, take it from me that I've been playing now for 3 years competitively.Invite link to get thingieshttps://www.playgwent.com/invite-a-friend/VN7IQY9ABA";1;439,1;19/05/2020;232;11;;0.0

25;RPG; 59,99;Greetings: My grandson talked me into trying Fallout 4. I'm an older player (65) who enjoys video games. I am very impressed with the game overall though I do wish I didn't have the CTD's and other issues with the game. But the ability to do the kind of building along with the post war setting has been a lot of fun. Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try. I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things. I do use quite a few mods and I'm sure the contributes to the CTD's etc in the game. I thing Bethsadia has done a great job presenting this game. I played the original Fallout many years ago. Having learned how to make video's of the gameplay and posting on youtube (mostly for my grandson to see my settlements) has been a nice side benefit of playing fallout. I would recommend the game and using mods...just do all you can to ensure things are loaded correctly.;1;2619,5;26/03/2017;768;35;;8.0
25;RPG; 59,99;I'll keep this short.If you want to play an excellent role-playing game where you can create a truly unique character and feel like your decisions have real consequences. Where every decision counts and you are constantly being presented with those decisions. Where factions, tribes and groups have a real impact and significantly affect the world.Play Fallout: New VegasIf you want to play an excellent looter-shooter with finely honed and extensive crafting systems that allow you to have full control over your customisation. Where you don't have to rely on VATS for shooting and weapons feel satisfying to fire/swing. Where power armour is true to its name and really is powerful but also realistic.Play Fallout 4These are two very different games and which one you should play is down to what you want to experience. Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best RPGs ever made but has terrible shooting mechanics and its looting systems are lacklustre. Fallout 4 has excellent mechanics and has one of the best looting and crafting systems in the RPG genre but its storytelling is rather linear and your choices are limited and often quite inconsequential.That's my two-penny's worth;1;183,4;23/10/2019;796;25;;8.0

25;RPG; 59,99;"Yeah, I've played it for a little bit.In all seriousness: this game has divided fan opinions, but in short: if you don't mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to do, then I'd recommend this game for you. I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:The good:+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like  laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace ""regular"" enemies depending on the player level.+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.The bad:- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.The mixed:* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games. Luckily, the bad retconning is limited to minor details only.* Creation Club. Like most of the world, I'm against paid mods, but fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything. In fact, they seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or two, so you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoever.In the end, I don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyone...so let me put it this way:If you prefer more in-depth roleplay, then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3.If you don't mind that and the flaws listed above too much, then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10. For what's it worth, I've certainly enjoyed it.";1;4694,7;10/10/2018;459;31;;8.0
25;RPG; 59,99;How to make Fallout 4 a decent ROLE-PLAYING gameYou might already know that Fallout 4 is a step backward from predecsessors when it comes to role-playing. So first download and install these mods: (Also note this is just my personal recommendation of mods)- Outcast and Remnants- Project Valkyrie- Fusion City (optional)- Depravity Evil Role Playing mod- Diary of a Madman- Start me Up (Alternate start mod)And that's it you're good to go. You can be whatever you want with these mods, you want to make peace with all factions? sure go ahead. You want to kill every factions and leaving with only you and your raider gangs to colonized the Commonwealth? sure go ahead.Another recommedation of mods that i personally use:- Real World Damages.     This mod will remove the bullet sponge throughout the game and can be really useful to   conserve ammo and your luggage. And also this mod will make you kill enemies easier, but  of course the NPC can also kill you by instantly, so neat right?- Full Dialog Interface.     Bring back dialog box options like in New Vegas.- Binary Speech Checks.     Makes the speech checks binary like in New Vegas.- Survival Options.     Bring back the quicksave or autosave options when playing the game on survival diificulty   mode. Because you don't know when the game would randomly crash right? this will   become a lifesaver.I already have 7th playthrough with this game and i will keep playing it from time to time.Now enjoy with your new fresh playhtrough Fallout 4.;1;844,4;12/11/2021;413;8;;8.0

26;RPG; 149,00;"Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment. worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream ""Fus Ro Dah!"", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. ""Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing.""I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!";1;1757,6;28/04/2022;604;327;;10.0

27;Action; 79,00;"Okay, as a 50+ year old gamer who's been playing since the 1970's I know my limits and I tend to stay away from ""twitch"" games where reaction times have to be razor sharp. With that in mind I avoided this game for a while, in spite of having enjoyed and finished every previous DOOM iteration from the beginning. When it went on a great sale I figured ""what the heck"" and decided to give it a try, thinking it might be a short-lived experiment. Boy was I wrong. The controls are intuitive and easy to master. The encounters are a blast and even failing is pretty fun as you figure out where you went wrong. I'm playing on the second level of difficulty and finding it challenging but just challenging enough to make it a lot more fun. The music and graphics are also excellent and add to the excitement.I do find that the best technique for surviving a difficult battle is to to just pace myself, taking bites out of the boss and avoiding going toe-to-toe with them as I run and jump around. I keep flaming and death punching the baddies to keep my armor and health up and I choose a weak one every now and then to chainsaw and get the ammo up. I can't really recommend this game enough. It's well balanced and exciting but not too overwhelming and it really rewards the creative use of weapons and using actual strategies. If you're old like me, don't be afraid and give it a go.

27;Action; 79,00;It's the raw cerebral intensity of Quake married with Doom's enemy roster and its violent, cathartic attitude. Enjoying this game requires a certain frame of mind, a certain willingness to push yourself and to think in the heat of the moment. But it's extremely rewarding if you meet it on its own terms. Nearly every weapon feels like it has a significant role, a stark contrast to Doom 2016's promotion of 2 weapon playstyles. Ammo counts have been massively reduced, pushing the player towards intelligent use of their loadout. Overall, the way I would describe this difference is that Doom 2016 treats its weapons as a set of toys, in which any can be used at any time without too much consequence. Doom Eternal treats them as tools, and you have to use them well to achieve success.The Doom Slayer is more mobile in every possible way and the combat is even more fast paced. Enemies are smarter, more aggressive and more varied across the board. New abilities like the blood punch, flame belch and ice grenade have been added, and provide even more tactical depth.The end result of all of this is a hyper-intense gameplay loop of constant movement, weapon swapping, and decision making. It makes you feel like a demon-slaying god when you finally overcome. It's extremely engaging to the point that I keep coming back even after like 4 playthroughs.All in all, from a gameplay standpoint it's one of the best SP FPS games ever, and a clear improvement over Doom 2016 in all of the ways that matter most. There's really not much else like this in the modern market. In an age in which arena shooters and movement based shooters are dying and the market is overwhelmingly shifting towards slower, less intense genres like tactical shooters and Battle Royales, it's nice to know that a game like this can still be made and find success. I'll get sappy for a second and say this: Thank you, id Software. You're the only AAA developer that still cares about the things I value in a shooter.;1;139,5;17/11/2020;645;12;;10.0
28;Action; 89,99;improves on every single aspect of the first game (which was already almost perfect) EXCEPT:-the outsider's new voice is bad, the previous one was way better but he doesn't appear for more than a couple minutes every now and then therefore it's not a big issue-voiced protagonists have verry little nuance to them, they mainly explain what is going on around them and sometimes TRY to emote but mostly fail since every characther in these games is really monotonous. the silent protagonist of D1 was more fitting to the theme and easier to relate to. the protagonist of the D1 DLCs, Daud, only narrated the beginning of the levels and responded to dialogue, was easier to cope with since he was an already established person in the game's world with pre-determined motives and thoughts-after a basic understanding of the game mechanics, it becomes really easy even on the hardest difficulty. your character becomes overpowered after a couple of hours and even that is  redundant since most of the game can be completed by blinking across rooftops and shooting your mission targets from a distance. i would have appreciated the higher difficulties being more populated by obstructions (guards, devices that try to stop you etc.)-the main thread of the plot feels a bit stretched, i will not go into detail due to spoilers but don't go into the game expecting to be blown away by twists and turns of the narrative, the game doesn't have those, and the ending is EXACTLY what you would expect after playing the game, no surprises there either, and it is mostly a setup for a secondary character that will show up in the DLC/expansionEven tho the flaws that i listed take up a lot of space (which is only because i wanted to explain them thoroughly), they don't take away much from the basic dishonored experience: supernatural assasin! the game is a lot of fun and has multiple paths to take, decisions to think about that matter, huge levels to explore, and many enemies to kill ( or avoid! ) in creative ways.

28;Action; 89,99;Dishonored 2 - is this a game for you?Right now, the game is undergoing a spell of patching after a very poor PC release.  The game worked for some, but not for many, and so your mileage will vary depending on your PC (not necessarily how powerful it is either - but how balanced, how much VRAM you have and such).  As most reviews already centre around performance issues, I won't spend too much time on those because I'd rather review the game itself but please bear them in mind (they are mentioned in the 'not so good' section below)....For people who didn't play the first Dishonored...While you can certainly play and enjoy the 'toys' of this superb game, the story will really make zero sense.  In the first game, the graphics and gameplay haven't aged at all and so I recommend you visit that title first, otherwise it will feel like starting to read a good book half way in.  The first game is often on sale, and it's an absolute gem, still carrying an 'overwhelmingly positive' review.  This game does genuinely feel like Part 2 of the series, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by skipping the first game (its story-based DLC is also a must-have, so buy the 'definitive' version which includes the DLC).For those who DID play the original...This second instalment manages to recreate that special Dishonored atmosphere of the first game.  I was worried that, not being set in Dunwall, the game would be altogether more sunny and cheery, but Karnaca is every bit as poor and derelict as Dunwall, with more opulence of the 'haves' rather than 'have nots' intertwined.  From the start, the game feels familiar in both setting and story. it truly IS 'more of the same' but in a great way: more of the same AND much more besides...The game feels shorter, but when I look at the hours played, it actually isn't.  Nine missions only, but these missions are made in typically bigger maps than we saw in the original game which of course means more replayability because there are again many ways in which to infiltrate an area.  There are more runes and charms to collect than in the first game, giving the game more side-mission style playability without detracting from the main story, and all the 'fun' toys are back so you can again mercilessly rig a Wall Of Light against your foes.  More importantly, as well as two chaos levels, you now have two different characters from which to choose, with different but wide-reaching skills and power sets that will give you a different game experience.  Finally, the skills upgrading has been given a huge overhaul.  You still collect the beloved runes and bone charms, but this time you can opt to craft your own bone charms which can be made up of up to four individual charms, thereby allowing you to tailor your character with many more perks than was previously possible.  10 bone charm slots can therefore give you a maximum 40 upgrades from the many bone charms you will uncover in this game.The plot itself is similar to the first game and the parallels are obvious, but the game does feel like an all-new title rather than a rehash, which is great.  There are plenty of nods back to the original story.  Replayability of this title is even greater because the playable characters of Emily and Corvo offer very different play-styles and approaches.  Arkane have provided a better balance of NPCs of different race and gender (one of the few poor things about the original title) which is great to see - it's clear that the developers listened.  And as if the game wasn't fun enough already, there is also a really clever level where you will manipulate time (travelling to through a map by choosing to switch between past and present as suits your route).  That is SO well done - a genius addition to the game.In summary, everything about this game brings about all the good of the first (which was pretty much all of it) and expands on it in numerous ways without destroying that special 'feel' created in the first game.  If it wasn't for the performance problems, this game would be an absolute guaranteed 'Game Of The Year' because it is truly excellent.  I really hope Arkane have good story-based DLC planned as they did for the original game, because I want MORE of this superb experience, and I hope they can solve the issues because everyone should be able to enjoy it.Anything not so good?Mostly, performance issues on PC.  These range from variable or very poor framerates, to crashes and total black-screen non-starts (the negative reviews all focus on these problems rather than actual gameplay).  Please do check the discussion forums to see who experiences what (so you can compare your PC with others) and do make the most of your two-hour refund window to progress through Mission 1 to the outside (where the performance tends to manifest once outdoors).The game FEELS short even though it really isn't.  I suspect this is because there are only 9 missions.  They are HUGE missions, but never-the-less that single digit makes the game feel much shorter than it really is.  I found myself in mission 7 of 9 in no time at all, or so it felt, yet in reality I'd been playing 25 hours or so by that point.  Being such a good game, I just wanted even more!Finally, a really minor point, but the Outsider has been reinvented with new voice actor and I don't really like what has been done.  In the original game, it was impossible to determine the Outsider's stance (was he a force for good or evil).  He was a dark, paranormal character who seemed moderately amused at your progression through Dunwall's affairs.  In the new game, the Outsider feels much less enigmatic and also biased more against 'bad' rather than being a mysterious force.  This is no show-stopper by any means, but I did prefer the original Outsider.SummaryDishonored 2 is an incredible game that is an absolute 'must-buy' if you enjoyed the original title - but only IF you can play it.  Patches are being released which have already made improvements.  Hopefully, the stuttering, crashes and frame-rate issues will be stamped out fully, leaving people with a truly excellent experience in the Dishonored universe that, despite current Steam ratings, is even better than the first game (and as players of the first game already know, that was a very high goal indeed).;1;172,6;23/11/2016;656;8;;8.0

28;Action; 89,99;"TLDR:Dishonored 2 is a direct sequel to Dishonored [1] but now you can choose to play as either Emily or Corvo. Both characters, if you choose to get supernatural powers, have different abilities available to them. The game's ending is dependent on how much 'chaos' your playstyle creates (aka how much you decide to kill). The mission maps are large sandboxes with different routes to get around and various hidden powerups lying around that you should look out for. The story isn't groundbreaking, but the overall gameplay is fantastic and makes Dishonored 2 highly replayable. GENRE:First-person stealth, actionGAMEPLAY:You begin the game by choosing between playing as Emily or Corvo, the protagonist of Dishonored [1]. Both characters have unique powers available to them so a playthrough with each should feel pretty different. You then choose whether or not you want to accept the ability to have powers. choosing not to would just make the game more challenging if you want it to be (and there is an achievement for completing the game w/o powers).The game takes place over the duration of nine main missions with some small downtime in between them. During a mission, your main objective is usually to 'eliminate' a target which means you can kill them or you can find a non-lethal way to take them out. *DISCLAIMER*If you are aiming to get all achievements ahead of time, just be aware that there are two achievements for:a) completing the game without being ever detectedb) completing the game without killing anyone (by any means)Missions are littered with hostile NPC's ranging from guards and patrol dogs to supernatural creatures and witches. You can choose to stealth your away around maps, avoiding detection and taking out enemies non-lethally, or you can go balls out and kill everything you see. Your actions have a direct impact on the story ending. generally the more you kill the darker the ending will be, and the reverse is true if you decide not to kill as much as possible.While exploring the map, you can encounter bonus objectives that see you help another NPC out in return for information or character bonuses in the form of money to spend at shops or power points to spend on your abilities. You can also find accessories called bonecharms that give you passive bonuses such as increasing the amount of mana you regen from a potion or increasing your speed during stealth mode. These accessories and other collectibles are 'missable' in the sense that once you leave the mission in a playthrough, you won't get a chance to return to that map without starting a new game, or by choosing to replay the map after mission completion. The mission completion screen will explicitly tell you what you found and what you missed.GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:REVIEWER'S PC SPECS   CPU Ryzen 5 5600   GPU RX 6800 XT   RAM 16 GB 3200 CL 16 I managed to play Dishonored 2 with the above specs at 1440p resolution ultra settings usually around 100-120 FPS. I only encountered one game crash when I attempted to quickload very fast after loading in which was not unreasonable. My overall experience was very stable.Graphically, the game looks and feels like Dishonored [1] but improved overall. Dishonored 2 mostly takes place in a different city called Karnaca which is vastly more colorful and vibrant than the dreary tone of Dunwall. The lighting was particularly impressive as there was a definite contrast between dark, shady areas and brightly lit rooms. The series maintains the aesthetics of looking somewhat like a 3D painting which I enjoyed from the previous game. STORY:Dishonored 2 takes place 15 years after the events of Dishonored [1]. Empress Emily and Royal Protector Corvo are honoring the anniversary of the queen's death when they are visited by a mysterious woman named Delilah who claims to be the true heir to the throne and proceeds to begin her coup d'état. You play as Emily or Corvo to fight back against Delilah and reclaim the throne as yours.STRENGTHS:•Stealth gameplay is pretty challenging, but fair. You are supplied with a generous toolkit containing sleep darts and blinding bolts for your crossbow, stun mines, and the old-fashioned method of choking people out from behind. •There is also a large toolkit for the lethal approach: a mainhand sword, an offhand pistol, grenades, and spring razor traps. •Emily's abilities offer fun tools for both a nonlethal and lethal approach. Domino lets you chain the minds of up to 4 people together so that anything that happens to one happens to all of them, and you can combine that with doppelganger to create a clone of Emily, domino it to a group of 3 people, choke out the clone, and knock all of the enemies down at once.•I have yet to play with Corvo yet, but he basically has the same abilities from the previous game like Posession and Bend Time.•Mission maps are sparse and full of opportunities to explore. You can take routes away from the main objective to discover unique NPC interactions, find locations of treasure to get more funding for character upgrades or tools at shops, or find secret accessories to give you important buffs for your playstyle. Personally, I normally took between 2 to 3 hours to complete each mission while attempting to fully explore every nook and cranny. •The voice acting for all characters is pretty good. no complaints. •There are various interesting puzzles that can be found. some require you to physically look around your surroundings for answers while others require decent logical deduction to complete without hints (I'm looking at you Jindosh door). •Arkane deserves props for simply designing the clockwork mansion mission map.•Without spoilers, Mission 8 is a wild mindf*ck but an amazing experience visually.WEAKNESSES:•I encountered some questionable bugs(?) during my non-lethal playthrough that existed to jeopardize players attempting to complete the game with no kills (e.g. a scripted event that can see 2 civilian NPC's get killed by guards if you interact with someone without dispatching of 2 guards later in the mission, or taking out a chain of dominoed enemies nonlethally, but the game recognizes it as lethal kills)•It's a pretty stereotypical royal revenge story.•Dog detection cones are wild. They can see/smell(?) you from miles away so they're just a hassle sometimes. NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):8.5/10Dishonored 2 is a delightfully challenging stealth-action game that takes the original Dishonored and improves upon it overall. Having the choices to play as either Corvo or Emily, to choose to accept powers or not, and to be lethal or nonlethal in your actions allows for lots of replayability opportunities. I would definitely recommend this game. Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time.

28;Action; 89,99;"Dishonored 2.If old Samuel could see me now...IntroductionAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.PlotThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to take back what's yours.Technical RevampShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio. sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now. some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.Setting & ExplorationAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca. known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well. emphasizing Arkane's ""play your way"" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.Depth in the DetailsOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.Stealth & CombatMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.Emily or CorvoIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, or Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach. or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.Main StoryReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects. such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.A Reactive WorldOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos. where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.ConclusionWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable. I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding";1;25,7;18/08/2018;121;0;;8.0

(OPTIONAL) Play Multiplayer DLC Comrades with friends.Why:The order I've given above is not in chronological order of events, Rather, the order I've given is a recommended approach to familiarize yourself with the characters and lore and gain a deeper appreciation for the main cast at each step. During the main game, read the character biographies in the Archives (found in the in-game menu). It sometimes explains things that happened off-screen, and is updated when significant events happen in the game.I will now explain in detail why I recommend the order above. Each of the following numbered points corresponds to the same numbered point above:1. If you're undecided about whether you should buy the game, the Demo gives you all of Chapter 1, which is a good opportunity for you to try the game's mechanics and decide if they are to your taste (especially the combat). If you've already bought the game, Chapter 1 is for you to get to know the main cast as they are ""now"". The supplementary material (the Brotherhood anime and the Prologue novella) will delve into their backstories a bit more. This means of course that the supplementary material actually takes place before Chapter 1, but I recommend playing Chapter 1 first - kind of like how in real life you meet people and get to know them as they are, and then once you've known them for a while, then you start to learn more about their past and their history2. This takes place before Chapter 1 and ends some time after Chapter 1. Noctis and his buddies are barely in the movie, but the movie sets up the world and lore - why Noctis and his buddies are doing what they're doing at the start of Chapter 1, and what's going on in their home city Insomnia while they're away. Pay attention to King Regis' motivations (try to empathize with him). In the movie's prologue, the white-haired boy is Ravus (he'll show up in the 2nd half of the game) and the girl is Lunafreya (Noctis' bride-to-be). If you can form an emotional connection with Lunafreya over the course of the movie, it will improve the emotional stakes of the game. The movie focuses on Nyx's point of view, but really the people you want to pay attention to (for the game's sake) is King Regis and Lunafreya. Also side note: Clarus (the shaven-head guy who's with King Regis) is Gladiolus' dad3. The real plot of the game starts here. At the start of the chapter you seek out Cor from the Crownsguard. Note that the Crownsguard is different from the Kingsglaive featured in the Kingsglaive movie. I initially confused this character with the leader of the Kingsglaive in the movie until I googled it4. The anime's ""present"" takes place while you're on your road trip around doing the tasks that you're told to do in Chapter 2, so this is a good time to watch it. The backstory of what happened to Noctis is a good way for you to understand why  Noctis is so broody. It's easier to empathize with him once you know the trauma he experienced as a child. Also, the little girl Iris in Episode 3 is Gladiolus' little sister and she shows up in the game.5. This takes place the day before Noctis and friends eave Insomnia to embark on their roadtrip. It ends right as they're going to the Citadel to meet King Regis (the opening scene of the game). I liked how it developed Noctis and Ignis' relationship a bit more, especially when Ignis recalls how Noctis' injury changed him. I presume this is the injury from the daemon in the Brotherhood anime. I believe that same injury is the one Noctis was still recovering from in the prologue of the Kingsglaive movie. This might help you understand Lunafreya's special place in Noctis' heart. At just 8 years old Noctis witnessed the death of his caretaker at the hands of a daemon and is himself injured. Presumably he is still recovering from this injury when he meets Lunafreya as a child in Tenebrae, which Noctis constantly has flashbacks to in the game. To meet someone so pure and loving like Lunafreya not long after his dark, traumatic experience with the daemon must have left a strong impression on him, building a strong emotional attachment for him to Lunafreya.6. Have fun. You might have heard that the sidequests are really unabashedly bad and of no consequence to the world/plot (unlike games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3). It's quite a shame because it's a such a missed opportunity, given how beautiful the Open World is to roam about in. SquareEnix probably just ran out of time or resources, and admittedly churning out well-written side-quests is probably the least of the concerns given the long development hell the game went through. Nevertheless, just take the sidequests and hunts as excuses for you to spend time with Noctis and his buddies. The more you develop an attachment to the 4 of them, the better the emotional payoff towards the end of the game and in the DLC.7. This DLC is about Gladiolus trying to get stronger so he can better protect Noctis. Not really much story development, but the combat is more skill-based and probably an interesting experiment on SquareEnix's part. If you like Gladioulus' combat style, you can unlock the ability to play him in the main game by spending AP in the main game's Ascension menu (it's under the Techniques tab). You can do this even before you play the DLC actually, but the DLC trains you better. If you finish the DLC it unlocks a new weapon (both Gladiolus and Noctis can use it) and ability for Gladiolus that carries over to the main game.8. The Open World is about to close off lore-wise soon. You can still play the Open World segment in the later chapters, but it's not lore-friendly because Noctis and his buddies are about to embark on a journey that leaves behind the Open World. You access the Open World through pretty much a game mechanic later on. I spent over 70 hours on the Open World before I finally moved on in Chapter 9. Think of it as time for you to develop your love for the main characters. The emotional impact of the linear Chapters 9-14 depend on this9. (See previous point)10. Enjoy the story!11.

30;RPG; 125,00;"UPDATE: Finished everything in the game.Excellent port!Configuration tips:1) Turning off all NVIDIA extra graphics settings improves FPS by a ton. Hairworks is the most lightweight one though (costs about 2fps) and looks amazing so I kept that one on.2) The High-Resolution Pack works great on a GTX 1070 (on 1440p res), even though it lists minimum requirements as being a GTX 1080 Ti, and I recommend you get it if you run a resolution greater than 1080p, have a GPU with 8GBs of VRAM, and have the extra 65GBs of space for it.3) If you have performance issues remember to update your drivers. Both Nvidia and AMD have new drivers that include optimization for this game.4) IMPORTANT EDIT: I originally had a guide here on how to edit the .ini file to support a 144hz monitor. After playing a little longer I noticed some bugs I was having such as long black screens before loading and hunt posters staying on screen after turning the quests in. Turns out this was due to editing the .ini file. Please reset your .ini file if you are having issues after editing it from my guide or another. Edits other than framerate can cause similar issues too. I recommend leaving the file alone for now.5) The options you get when booting up the game ""Television"" or ""Home Theater"" don't affect your display, they actually affect your audio. It also had nothing to do with stereo or surround sound. It determines audio compression. If you are using low quality speakers select ""Television"" as it will sound better for you. Otherwise choose ""Home Theater"".Note: I know many are reporting random CTDs or frame drops but I haven't experienced a single CTD and the game runs smooth as butter for me staying between 50-60 fps even when encountering large enemies (i7-4790k, GTX 1070, 16GB 2133 DDR3 RAM, SSD).Game Review:PC Support - 9/10Performance - 9/10Graphics - 9/10Sound - 8/10Music - 8/10Story - 9/10Gameplay - 7/10Multiplayer - 4/10 (mostly dead by the time I got to it)Things I like:Story was great and the main crew are some of the most unforgettable characters in gaming.The setting is a mix of high fantasy and steampunk but where some characters just look like normal people driving cars and stuff.The summons and giant creatures you sometimes encounter are epic. Imagine fighting a boss the size of a mountain... so big the camera doesn't even function correctly.You're driving a luxury vehicle that transforms several times throughout the game.Whole game is very stylish.Things I don't like:The story won't hit like it should unless you experience the other accompanying FFXV media first such as Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV and Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV. While not as important it might even be worth it to play A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV and watch the Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV on YouTube.Episode Ardyn isn't included in this edition and it's the best DLC content.Side quests are some of the most boring unmemorable side content I've played through, reminds me of MMO fetch quests with no real story involved. I recommend skipping them even if you are a completionist.The high level challenge dungeons are just seemingly endless copy and paste floors of enemies, don't bother with these either.Unlike others I don't have a problem with the combat, I have a problem with the difficulty. The game is way too easy since you can just buy and carry ridiculous amounts of healing items. I later found out there is an easy mode but not hard mode which is just absurd. Definitely play with the hard mode mod from the Nexus even if it's your first time playing.The brainless minigame ""Justice Monsters Five"" is way too easy and therefore way too long and boring however if you play it long enough you can get some great items from it at the beginning of the game.";1;132,0;7/03/2018;509;11;;8.0

However, I do not give out any specific spoilers, so rest assure.[STORY]Now, after beating the main story for myself, I will say one very important thing about the pacing of the story: the chapters feel very rushed toward the end, and it felt like each few sections of chapters within the game were developed, or written, by different people, Not to mention the numerous plot holes that were in each chapter, especially towards the end of the game. It goes from semi-dynamic gameplay to dynamic, and then to linear, which is absolutely disappointing. During the dynamic portion of the game, you can start and finish many side-quests, dungeons, or just power level via fighting monsters and bosses. Then, when you decide to progress through the story, about three-fourths of the way through progression, the game just decides to throw you into a linear structure of gameplay, which you will notice after about five minutes of playing through it. To conclude the topic of the game's story, let me say that it started it out pretty well, then escalated into something worse, but manageable if you don't think too critically about the plot holes, or why they developers decided to do what they did.Nonetheless, I still loved the characters, especially the main four and their small interactions during the open-world sequences.[DLC]So, at long last, I have finished all three DLC's. My experiences with Episode Gladiolus and Prompto differ from Episode Ignis. I didn't dislike any of the DLC's. however, I thoroughly enjoyed Episode Ignis a lot more not just because of the better combat mechanics, but because the story from the full-game is actually redeemed in a way through playing this DLC. The way they handled this DLC was pretty genius, and if you play through it, you might think the same. I can't say why exactly without giving out spoilers, so I'll stop talking about Ep. Ignis here. Each time the three DLC's were released, they got better and better. Episode Glad was a bit weak in terms of content, but explained what happened during a certain part of the main-game's story. Episode Prompto was very good in developing Prompto's character, but was weak in gameplay. There were moments during combat where I was getting a bit frustrated with how weak I was against the enemies. The mechanics were cool, but it felt like I was playing a third-person shooter made by Ubisoft.My overall thoughts on all three DLC's: They were very good in terms of story and character development. some could use tweaking in gameplay mechanics. and beating each DLC can give you extra items/weapons/fashion in the main game which is a plus. Although they felt weak at times, I liked all three of the DLC's. I believe they added onto the main game's story plot points quite a bit, which makes them more than worth playing.[GAMEPLAY]{Played this game with a Playstation 3 controller}I will try to keep this short and start off by saying that the gameplay is amazing! No, the combat is not turn-based, although you can enable the ""Wait"" combat function in the options at any time, which gives you a slight feel of the combat being turn-based. I decided to play without it, and I had a blast. My only gripe about the combat is that you can't freely use magic. You have to create it by absorbing three types of elements: electricity, fire, and ice. With these three, you can create a spell, which usually comes in a stock of x3 or x4. Furthermore, you can add a fourth item from your inventory which gives the spell more potency and effects. It's not so bad once you get used to it, but I still do wish you can use White Magick or Black Magick like in the older games. [VISUALS]Another disclaimer: This is a budget gaming PC I created in 2015. so yes, it is on the low-mid end tier. CPU: Intel i5-3570k (3.4ghz, NOT OC'd)GPU: Gigabyte GTX 960 2GBRAM: 8 GB DDR3DISK: Game installed on Samsung 850 EVO SSD 250 GBOS: Windows 7 64-BitOkay, so after testing various graphics settings via playing the demo before the full-game release, I ended up playing the majority of the full-game in the ""High"" setting with the scaling set to 100%. As many of you would expect with my specs, I did end up with a few problems here and there. After beating certain parts of the main story, I would end up running into a cutscene with about 10-20 frames running, even after the cutscene ended. So, I would be playing at the said frames unless I restarted my game. The same problem would sometimes happen after I perform a summon. Because of this, towards the end of the game, I switched to the ""Average"" graphics setting and I was mostly fine from there. There was one immersion-breaking moment that happened in a certain cutscene during the final hour or two of the game, where Noctis was invisible, but it was a rather short and less-important cutscene, so I was okay with it.On the ""Average"" settings, I was getting about 45-60 frames with a few dips here and there, but I did end up beating the game without the frames ever being locked to 30. So here's a tip from me: play this game with a graphics card with more VRAM than me. or just have a better machine than mine, which I'm sure is the case for many of you. I just thought I would add this section for the few that have rigs similar to mine. Final note, don't enable the last four ""NVIDIA"" graphics settings because those destroy your frames, even if you have an a slightly better setup than mine.[LOADING SCREENS]Okay. So, If you've played this game on a console after the initial release in 2016, you know how excruciatingly long the loading screens were. If you install this game on a standard HDD, you will get the same effects. However, if you install on an SSD, the longest you will have to wait is about 30 seconds. The average time it took for me to sit through the load screens was about 3 to 15 seconds. That's it.So try to install on an SSD if you have one. I moved a few of my steam games over to my 4TB HDD, just to install this and it was worth it. [As of 03/10/2018] On my end, this game is about 83.3 GB's, so maybe use that as reference to find some space.[VOICE ACTING]I don't mean to start a war over ""Sub vs. Dub"". I appreciate both languages.As a Japanese-American who fluently speaks and comprehends both the English and Japanese language, I played the entire game in Japanese, with English subtitles. Thank you Square Enix for adding that function to almost all of your newer games! I have watched a few Twitch streamers and YouTubers play the game in English, and I have to say both are very good. However, there were very key differences in the acting. Once again, let me state that I am not being biased because I'm Japanese. I believe I have a pretty good understanding of the level voice acting displayed on both sides of the spectrum. Now, my thoughts are that some of the characters' voices in English are a bit jarring at times. Since writing some of my specific critiques on the voices would end up riling some of you, I will avoid in doing so. However, I will say that the Japanese voices fit perfectly, and I had no problems at all.It was interesting, though, to hear Cindy talk in Japanese. In English, she has that southern accent, but in Japanese, she just speaks using standard Tokyo dialect. No complaints though. Also, the localization of this game made it so the subtitles are following the English voices, not Japanese. So if you play with Japanese voices, know that not all dialogue is the literal translations. Steam's character limit is preventing me from so much more explanation, unfortunately. Sorry.Edit [03/20/18]:- Added review of the DLC's- Cleaned up and fixed points in review- Removed review's ""Conclusion""";1;122,1;10/03/2018;268;8;;2.0
30;RPG; 125,00;FFXV is such a paradox. On one hand, it is such a flawed game. flawed in its core fundamentals - empty open world, middling and slightly repetitive side quests, weak narrative structure (can i just say, i adore the FFXV lore? why is it not in the game???). but somehow, all these things become bearable because i have the company of 3 extremely lovable, adorable, and memorable companions/party members. i will slog through endless walking in a barren field to kill 5 enemies because i want to hear noctis mistake prompto for ignis during their linkstrikes. i'll drive (also known as the most boring way to traverse an open world i've ever known) just to do prompto's lil photo spot side quests. i'll cook in campsites so gladio can have his cup noodles. YOU GET IT. the 4 main characters make the game shine, and if i'm being honest - hold every flimsy mechanic together. so, be prepared to cry your eyes out whenever you hear stand by me after beating this game because for fk's sake, it's been 5 years and i know i sure do get teary eyed when that song plays.;1;79,4;28/06/2023;171;3;;8.0
30;RPG; 125,00;This is a tragic game.  There are signs that this was supposed to be the greatest game ever.  If I showed you cutscenes and gameplay, you'd think they look spectacular.If I described armigar, warp strikes, chain strikes, etc, you'd think it sounded intense.If I told you the bullet points of the story, you would think it sounded intriguing.  It was going to gather together numerous elements of the entire final fantasy series into one complete and spectacular legend.Something went wrong, maybe it didn't get finished.  Pieces got sewed together.  There is no flow, no pace, no bridging any of it together.  Massive plot points are simply mentioned.  Gameplay gets tiresome as you just wail on enemies and getting higher powered just means it takes 20 seconds to kill a bad guy instead of 40.  It's fine for RPG combat, but it's not fun enough to carry exploration and other content.  Speaking of which, optional content is the worst part.  HOURS and hours of this game can be described as fetch quest 1-10, picture quest 1-10, animal gathering 1-10, Hunt monsters for gil etc.  Minimal dialogue, no development, and no point except money and wasting time and making you wonder what you are doing with your life.  You need an RPG to have character development, interesting plot, interesting themes, suprises, warmth and heart.  The sidequests are empty and frustrating.  It's probably wise to leave them when you have had enough.  However, every once in a while during the main story you are whisked away for a few moments and forget how bad it was for the hours wasted in between cutscenes.  Sometimes it feels totally worth it.  Some additional thoughts:  I watched Kingsglaive and the brotherhood miniseries before playing, and they went a long way to helping me enjoy the game.  Watching them all before playing any of the game wasn't confusing.   Playing the game in english means that your buddies will say dorky things, maybe playing in japanese can insulate you from that (assuming you can't tell the difference between dorky and cool japanese) The game in its current form is about a C+, I'm glad I played it.  I just regret that I never get to play the game it was supposed to be.;1;170,5;21/09/2018;358;8;;2.0
30;RPG; 125,00;If you follow these steps you  should be able to understand the game's story and relate to characters, I will divide this into 2 part, before and after playing:1-Before playing.Watch Kingslaive movieWatch all the brotherhood episodes2-After playing:-Play Episode Gladio right after chapter 6-Play Episode Ignis after Episode 9 (best episode)-Play Episode Prompto after chapter 12-Play Episode Ardyn after Episode 13-Do not play Episode Comrades unless you want some half baked multiplayer that no one plays anyway.-Don't mind game telling you to finish the game before playing these DLC's, just ignore the message.I haven't played endgame where you explore some secret dungeons and bosses, I fell like I got what i wanted from story and done for now.Final advice.

31;Action; 352,91;Feels like they've lost touch with their fans. They don't seem to understand what made Just Cause 2 so great. JC4 feels like a really emotionless entry to the series that continues to depend on gimmicks to try to get players attention instead of having an actual fun gameplay loop.If you love the series because of Just Cause 2, play that game or buy this one if it's heavily on sale. If you liked Just Cause 3, this is basically worse than that game.Things about this game i'm bitter about: No dual wielding, no grenades/c4, grapple reliant puzzles/objectives, lots of escort & defense missions, lots of terminal hacking in every base, no weapon/character upgrading at all, vehicle handling is terrible even the helicopters, the graphics somehow got worse from JC3. I could go on but I won't. This game really dissapointed me.;0;11,5;6/06/2019;736;15;;2.0
31;Action; 352,91;"HOLD ON THERE STRANGER, SCROLLING THROUGH THE REVIEWS! HEAR MY WORDS, AND LET ME TELL YOU A TALE: A TALE OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND ANGER. LEND ME YOUR EARS, AND LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU...I've played a TON of JC2 and JC3, so I was excited to try Just Cause 4. I saw all the negative reviews, saying how it's trash and all that. But I thought, ""Hey, I'm going to give it a fair shot. I don't really care about graphics, as long as I'm just having fun."" So, I bought it at full price, and booted up the game, excited to cause some delicious mayhem!I wanted to like this game. I really did! But I did not. NOT AT ALL.First impressions went something like this: ""Okay cool, bad guy likes weather. Wait, where are my attachable C4's? Maybe I unlock them later. Explosions! Huh. They seem pretty lack-luster. I feel like JC3's were better. Okay, well at least I can shoot these guys up. I'll just find some pistols a second. (20 minutes pass) Are there no PISTOLS? PISTOLS?! Okay, what about grenades?! Please tell me you at least have some dam GRENADES. It's like a staple in ever action game ever. No? *sigh* I'll just continue this boring mission. Wait, where am I going? Oh, okay over there at that tiny marker. I'll just grapple over there and- Woah what? WHAT THE F*CK DID THEY DO TO MY GRAPPLE?  MY BABY! okay, this is fine. I think I can live with this? Now I gotta go meet with some dude and stuff and... what is even going on?! I'll just open my map, and... What. The. F*ck. Is. THIS?! WHAT KIND OF MENU IS THIS? Stay cool. Pretty soon, it'll become natural (it did not btw). Okay, finally. I can customize my grapple. Maybe I can fix it or something. Nope. Alright, well now I can add balloons and stuff. So I have to go to this menu, into that sub-menu, into that tab, into that selection, and then choose the addition, and then choose the specific type of addition (while holding down a key and cycling through them only with another random key) and... these are the worst controls. You know what? IO'm done. I'm F*CKING DONE WITH THIS BS!"" *closes game and goes into steam to order my refund.(Also, there are only sport cars on the roads, so it doesn't feel special when you drive one. And, the cars are way too boring. Also, the controls for driving SUCK A*S.)I should also note that the liberation system that has been some of the best parts of the series is now gone, and replaced with a stupid squad system that you have to earn and unlock, and it's all just very confusing. Trust me.In summary, this game seemed to say, ""Hey, if we just slap the Just Cause logo onto the front of it, people will buy it! Don't worry too much about gameplay or the fundamental fun parts about the previous games. It's all about that sweet, sweet revenue."" It pays too much attention to the small things like radio songs and customizing how fast a balloon inflates than the basic point of a game. TO HAVE FUN. As I said before, I'm disappointed that I must write this negative review, but it's just a bad game...NOTE: HOPEFULLY, PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ THIS REVIEW AND DON'T BUY THIS GAME.

31;Action; 352,91;"Plus Points:+ Absolutely stunning map. Best world design in the Just Cause series so far.+ Large variety of interesting vehicles and weapons+ Grappler tools are funMinus Points:- You can't liberate bases and settlements anymore. You can still blow stuff up, but everything you destroy will just respawn and doesn't count towards the completion of the game like in previous entries to the series. This makes destruction, which has always been the main point of the Just Cause games, completely pointless.- Instead of destroying enemy bases, you now liberate regions using ""squads"". You earn these for doing pretty much anything in the game, including blowing stuff up, but they are so easy to get you'll never be short of them. Once you have earned enough you can click the region on your map and it will suddenly be liberated. This means you can liberate many regions without even actually going there (for some regions you have to do a single short mission first). You can completely liberate the entire map without visiting most of it. And that is a shame since the map is so beautiful. The map is filled with interesting locations and well-designed enemy bases, but you have no real way or incentive of interacting with it. I do like the frontline mechanic since it makes the world feel more like there is an actual war going on, but they should not have removed the need to destroy enemy bases to liberate regions, which was the main content of all previous Just Cause games.-In this vast, beautiful map, there is really nothing to do except the story missions, of which there are not very many, are short and so far have been quite forgettable (I haven't finished them all yet so I hope it gets better near the end). The archaeology missions are fun though (even if they paint a very unrealistic picture of what archaeology is like), but maybe I am just saying that because I am an archaeologist and just love what I do. There is also challenges to complete in every region, but they are just boring ""fly or drive through these hoops"" affairs and they are not actually challenging at all.To sum it up, Just Cause 4 is a fun sandbox to mess around in. It has a beautiful, well-designed map but the game doesn't really make use of it. Everything you destroy just respawns after a little while, so all the sandbox action unfortunately quickly starts to feel pointless. And once you grow tired of pointlessly destroying the same stuff over and over again the only thing to do is bland story missions and dumb repetitive challenges. It really had the potential to be a great game, but it got screwed over by one massive, really bad change in the core game design. Respawning, pointless bases really aren't fun, and destroying these massive complexes in inventive ways used to be the primary fun thing to do in Just Cause games.  By making them just respawn, the developers took out all of the satisfaction you got from destroying them. And without all that fun, Just Cause 4 is really just the empty shell of a Just Cause game.Please play Just Cause 3 or 2 instead, they are much, much better games that will keep you entertained for far longer, even despite the horrible optimisation and performance of Just Cause 3. At least that is one more plus point for Just Cause 4, it does run great with almost no lag, stuttering or crashes which JC3 suffered from a lot. Unfortunately that does not compensate for its lack of fun gameplay.";0;17,2;15/04/2019;456;10;;2.0
31;Action; 352,91;It's.. sorta worth it if you get it very on sale. But just get Just Cause 3. It's a better game. This game feels like the devs forgot what made Just Cause 3 so much fun. I think the best example of this is how region takeovers are performed. This is the core gameplay loop. to progress the story you need to liberate the area that missions take place in, often multiple areas per story mission. This should be one of the most fun parts of the game. It is in JC3, but not in JC4.In Just Cause 3, you take over areas by liberating military outposts. You 'liberate' them by... blowing everything up. If it's a static object with red bits, it's explosive and you need to remove it. There are some awesome really big setpiece things to destroy, like massive radar dishes. This fits in with the core gameplay perfectly. you can seamlessly transition between tearing things apart with your grappling hook, to hijacking a helicopter to fire missiles at them, to crashing the helicopter into one last tower before switching to a mounted gun, or your RPG, or anything. In Just Cause 4, you take over regions by.. performing really boring missions inside the bases. The enemy spawn rate seems to have gone down compared to JC3. you'll sometimes find yourself totally alone in these enemy bases. Without a focus on destroying things, almost your entire toolkit as a player is worthless. No need for vehicles. their destructive capabilities are wasted, and getting around is actually faster without them. No big set pieces to find fun ways to tear apart, because that's not the objective anymore, it's hack this console, escort these refugees, pull those breakers, stand still in this small area to complete an upload.;0;11,2;6/06/2021;372;1;;2.0
31;Action; 352,91;"Before you buy this game, you should really listen to the negative reviews. I ignored them, thinking it would be another JC game that I would enjoy, and that the negative reviews were just the result of some day 1 bugs or people's expectations being too high.Oh, was I wrong. This is actually a bad game. There are an extreme amount of reasons for this. Graphical glitches, absolutely unacceptable graphics/textures/etc. considering how JC3 looked, bad- no, TERRIBLE story. Many features from JC3 have been removed, like the sticky explosives, pistols, and liberation mechanics, which is literally the whole focal point of the game. All of my actions feel entirely disconnected from the outcome of my actions. I go and download some files, and bam I've liberated an entire region. Where in JC3 it felt good liberating areas and took some work, in JC4 it's literally you pressing a button. The missions are so, so much worse. They're all bland ""go here, wait for bar to go up/down, you win!"" missions, which brings me to my biggest gripe with the game:IT IS BORING. It is so unbelievably boring that you could easily fall asleep playing it. You know how destroying things is important in Just Cause games? Well, not in this one. Sure, you get chaos points, but you could just get them doing other things. The stuff you destroy eventually respawns, the weapons have low ammo counts, and destroying things isn't nearly as cathartic as it was in JC3.In the end, if you want this game, go buy Just Cause 3. If you already have it, buy the DLC. If you've already 100% the game and all of it's DLC, then replay the game because you're going to get way more enjoyment out of that then mindlessly roaming around a map looking for something to do.";0;12,4;27/04/2019;616;13;;1.0
31;Action; 352,91;Just Cause 4 forgets its origins.In JC3 the game and it's story seem carefully crafted to NOT take itself too seriously and just enjoy its mechanics of mayhem and destruction.  The witty banter, an over the top dictator, enjoyable destruction via wacky physics, and a whole mess of over powered weaponry entertained me through its main game and all its DLC.JC4 on the other hand takes a turn from some of those elements.  Rico isnt as funny anymore and is border line brooding. He doesn't have any witty companions, the story seems to want to take itself seriously and some of those wacky physics are a bit too wacky.  The departure from its predecessor came as a suprise to me and I believe is a direct result to some of the lesser gripes I was muttering to myself as I played the game.  The choppy water was gone and had been replaced with really crappy looking water. I know, not a big thing, but the waves in JC3 gave life to that part of the game.  It's hard not to notice its absence.Helicopter controls became worse and it was almost impossible for me to target enemy choppers using missiles.  I hardly even know how to describe this issue with text. I literally can not shoot a missile at a flying enemy unless the aiming reticle is on them and turns red, but if that enemy is moving forget about it, because you have to lead your target only you can't because your reticle has to be on the target to get it to turn red so you can shoot at it unless its moving...ARGGGGGHHHH!Some changes, like removing grenades and replacing them with secondary functions on certain weapons have left me on the fence. Most of the secondary functions are great and enjoyable, but I personally like the staple of having grenades at all times. If that was something I wanted to maintain as I played it meant that I had to carry a specific weapon with me that had that secondary function.  And since you can only carry two weapons with you I often times felt limited.  Planted explosives are also gone which is something I miss.  The map just seems so much smaller than JC3.  I bet this statment is false, but I burned through it so damn fast it felt* smaller by comparison.  The introduction of front lines where the rebels are fighting the enemy initially seemed like it would be a cool thing, but there was so little impact to whatever I was doing or how I was progressing through the game it made me wonder why it was there in the first place.  Instead of liberating multiple small settlements to free zones now all one has to do is a single mission. And there are only 3 or 4 versions of that mission and they just aren't as engaging. It seems odd to look back at JC3 and find that the repetitive nature of freeing settlements by blowing up the same damn things was more fun, but there it is.I don't really hate JC4. I can still do goofy things and I have fun with the new tether options that are available.  I gripe because it moved away from things that I liked or expected to see again from JC3.  This game falls into the category of sequels where instead of getting the previous game plus more*, I got a little less with some changes that just didn't measure up to its predecessor.  I haven't given up on this game, but I won't likely spend much time on it unless the DLC's bring something special with them.;0;54,3;20/12/2018;1264;35;;4.0
31;Action; 352,91;I'm really torn on writing this review. Just Cause 4 does do some things very well, but other things are a major step backwards from JC3.As a sandbox, JC4 is great. The grapple has been further improved over JC3 with the new balloons and upgrades to the existing boosters and tether. There's a nice variety of terrain to explore and random stuff to blow up, and a lot more working utility vehicles with functional cranes and forklifts for example. Plus there's new weather control bases you can use to spawn destructive weather at will once they've been captured.Unfortunately, as a game, JC4 just isn't that much fun at times. JC3 got a lot of flak for the base liberation being repetitive and tedious at times and JC4 tried to address that with more missions. On the surface this seems like a good idea until you realize that the same few annoying mission objectives are copy-pasted multiple times with just slight variations. To make things worse, many of these objectives involve defending fragile items or hacking terminals with a countdown timer where you can't do anything else, and have to restart when interrupted. The endless respawning hyper-aggresive AI in Just Cause has always been a problem, and mission objectives like these just highlight how bad it is when attack helicopter after attack drone appears out of nowhere and does massive damage to the fragile item you have to protect. Worse, the controls are frequently unresponsive and the gunplay is sloppy, and the endless respawning enemies include way too many soldiers with grenade/rocket launchers that will ragdoll you all over the place. Not to mention that the DEVS REMOVED C4!!!This is why I'm torn on this review. The sandbox is great, but it's locked behind a lot of content that's more frustrating than fun, and the linear missions remove the freedom you had in earlier games on how to approach liberating bases.At the end of the day I've decided to recommend this game with major caveats. Get it on sale, do not pay full price for this. Use a savegame or mod that opens up the sandbox much earlier and save yourself the frustration of dealing with the poor mission design.The Good:World is more varied and interesting than JC3PROPER TRACKED TANKS!!!Working actuators on vehicles like cranes and forkliftsImproved grapple abilitiesInteresting weapons with alternate fire modesCutscenes and story are surprisingly decent with lots of humorFriendly tanks/choppers will occasionally help you out in combatThe Bad:Can't take over bases by blowing stuff up, have to complete annoyingly linear missions including dreaded escort/protect/hacking objectivesAI is still as annoying and bad as ever with enemies appearing out of thin air right next to youSloppy on-foot/grapple controls and gunplayBikes are terrible to driveLess destroyable bridges compared to JC3The Ugly:NO C4!!!Update:I got the gold edition with the DLC and finished playing through the DLC content, so here's a quick review of the DLC:Weaponized Wingsuit:Awesome, one of the best reasons to get the gold edition. Makes some missions much easier since you have infinite wingsuit missiles. More or less the same thing you get from JC3's sky fortress DLC.Dare Devils of Destruction:Mad Max style death races in JC4. The new vehicle variants with guns are fun, but the actual missions themselves are annoying score attack objectives that you'll need to replay repeatedly to unlock everything. 5/10, worth playing if you have gold, hard to recommend getting if you don't.Los Demonios:Bad, bad, bad. If you have gold, I wouldn't recommend even starting the mission arc. The rewards aren't even remotely worth it (a crossbow and the ability to spawn the super annoying demon bugs anytime), and if you start the mission arc you'll need to finish the awful missions to get the map back to its original state (demon bug infestations block you from completing some of the vehicle/wingsuit stunts until they're cleared). At least clearing the infestations involves liberation style destroy everything missions instead of protecting/hacking things. The first mission itself is fine at least and moderately interesting, but it goes downhill fast after that. Final boss fight is a new level of awfulness for the franchise worthy of a spot on the list of worst video game boss fights of all time. 1/10, don't waste your time on this content, it will actively make the rest of the game worse until it's fully completed.Danger Rising:Actually a good DLC. Lots of new toys to play with, interesting locations to liberate by destroying everything, and some more story content with Rico and the Agency to boot. Only negatives are some of the mandatory hoverboard challenges to open the reactors are annoying and don't make sense from a gameplay or logical standpoint. 9/10, great DLC pack.;1;70,1;6/11/2019;465;18;;5.0
31;Action; 352,91;"Was really hoping for this to be good...I loved Just Cause 2 AND 3 and Just Cause 3 was a game that I could waste many, many hours on whenever I was bored.Just Cause 3's addition of a wingsuit felt like something that fit perfectly in the game and the controls were seemingly tight and fluid. The challenge system for unlocking upgrades was annoying at first but at least it forced you to actually use the things in question and, by extension, get better at using them. Soon, after a bit of grinding, I could take down bases with ease, grappling through on my wingsuit as fueltanks blew up behind me. Rico was unstoppable.Then the Sky DLC came out for it (only DLC that was worth it) and everything got better. Suddenly, Rico was a literal super hero, nothing could stop me, barrel-rolling through obstacles as I pumped missles into them from my back, only to dive into the water, jet away under the waves and launch up from underneath like f***ing Iron Man....Now, I bought this with the deluxe content because i wanted that experience of flying a jetpack wingsuit and destablilizing a nation again.What I got was:1) Terrible controls for the wingsuit: Airbraking now stops you dead in the air? No Swooping, no changing directions suddenly, everything feels more sluggish...2) The DLC Jetpack has been bastardized: Your charge for boost gets used up whether you use it fully or not. Accidentally tapped the button? There's all your boost gone. Missiles are innacurate and sometimes just flat bounce off of things. You lose all your speed the millisecond you're done boosting so its usually faster to grapple everywhere. Its so damn hard to manuever when boosting as well, so more often than not you end up smashing your face in. AND WHY OH WHY did the devs get rid of the launching by holding the wingsuit button. It was the coolest thing ever to launch out of an explosion like a damn super hero....3) Graphics: Im not usually one to care too much about graphics as long as it's fun but the water was the one thing that actually took me out of the game because of how bad it looked. I dont want to gripe but JC3 had water that looked a billion times better than this flat, out-of-focus, brown sludge that's everywhere. Not to mention the glitchy texture breaks and the fact that your parachute shows up as a reflection that looms larger than the mountains. And what is up with Tom Sheldons glowing facial hair...4) Gameplay: The story in this game is as cookie cutter as it comes. Escort mission after Escort mission after Escort mission. And for the Piece de Resistance for some unforseen reason, the developers of this game decided to get rid of the most fun aspect of the Just Cause Series: The Chaos. In JC3 and 2 the base liberation revolved around destroying enough enemy infrastructure to to remove their presence from the region. This provided some of the best gameplay experiences that I've had in a while. It gave me a reason to want to unlock and upgrade my weapons and vehicles. Nothing better than clearing a base with a single Bavarium Nuke. In JC4, base liberation is boring, only capturing an entire region when you have enough squads to move a line on your map to encompass that area and then that base is yours, fully intact. The game world is also considerably less destructible, I've only found wooden bridges that i was able to destroy when I had a ton of fun in JC3 sending trains and patrols to their deaths by blowing the bridge at a safe distance....5) Weapons: I've played about 9 hours so far, a lot of which was flying through f***ing rings to get more missiles and more boost for my jet wingsuit, and I've yet to find any weapons that really excited me. Plastic explosives have been completely removed from the game, replaced by booster rockets, which i assume the devs thought everyone liked better, and even then those only explode when modded enough to be useless as boosters.6) Grappling: This grapple system is split into 3 loadouts, which you can switch between freely. However, I would find that I would often need to change my loadout in the menu in the middle of a fight to get the effect I wanted, which completely shatters my fun and immersion. The grapple having all these effects is, for me, way more annoying than fun. I liked the simplicity of JC3 where you had to use the environment to lift things or switch your explosives for boosters to get that effect, and having the grapple just grapple things together and pull.All in all, I think the devs thought they were (or maybe actually were) being pressured to innovate everything to keep things fresh, when in reality they pretty much destroyed everything that I personally enjoyed about the game.Edit: Dec 12, 2018, 5:36pmCouple of extra points about JC4 that I've found after completing the whole game and all side missions:Enemy A.I. seems to be pretty well improved and after going back and playing JC3 right after beating 4, I will say that combat on the ground is better in every way (besides ammo), it feels way more tactile and headshots have a great feel to them, unlike in JC3.The weather, since it was a selling point, should have been implemented more. The three or four types of weather in the game pretty much only exist around the bases it spawns from. I only played one mission other than the main base missions that featured a sandstorm to deal with and I have to say it made the ""pick up a sniper and protect mission"" I'd done 10 times already way more fun and worth doing. Why wasnt the weather everywhere on the map???       Also yes I understand there were guns that simulated the weather effects (lightning and wind) but why weren't players rewarded with a more powerful version to have fun with, with this being a physics sandbox? I would've rather had a small scale tornado to play with or the chaotic winds of a sandstorm to release on enemies than a windblast and random lightning.Storywise this game takes itself way too seriously. I see a lot of people talking about how JC3 had a s*** story with no humour like what was in JC2 (admittedly JC2 was over-the-top parody funny and I had a ton of fun with my friends playing it), but JC3 had humour of its own with Mario and Rico interacting and DiRivello was, in my opinion, a great villian which you got to see insight into with the collectibles in the game (audio tapes). JC4, in comparison, felt like the devs were trying to hit a way darker tone with the fate of Rico's family and Sheldon's reconciliation. All in all it made for (in my opinion) very shallow experience with characters that you didn't care for at all.The side missions felt tacked on to me. they were more a delivery system for upgrades than actual story bits. The movie producer (forgot her name) was the only one that had actual cutscenes and she's the one I cared about the least. Sargento was the one character I actually cared about, since it seemed Rico felt for him and was taking him under his wing (no pun intended), however he only gets one mission with a cutscene or any plot, the rest he just tells you to do the same thing, with the same recycled lines over the radio (rescue, escort, or snipe). No character growth or interest whatsoever. Javi's missions were cool but were over way too quickly. They all take place on one portion of the map, which is the most boring because there isnt any weather effects or higher level bases nearby.Thus concludes my edited review, let me know what ya'll think or if there is anything I missed.";0;18,6;4/12/2018;741;27;;2.0
31;Action; 352,91;"UpdateI have now finished the game, got every achievement (except the hidden ones, the one about beating a friends feat and the one for getting all achievements). I like this game, once you get through the meh story missions to unlock all the regions and the god-awful liberation missions. It is fun to just fly around in whilst watching YouTube on the other screen. Other than that... Still bad. I do not recommend this, having to do 20+ hours of crap to get to an OK game is really not a good way to spend your time.TL.DRLess explodey version of JC3, if you liked JC3's ""explode everything"" mentality you probably wont like this.Replaced the ""explode all the things to liberate province"" missions with ""push this button/escort these guys/turret section to liberate province"" missions.Pros, Mehs, and ConsPros:More vehicle variety than JC3.The wingsuit is back, and just as awesome as ever.Winner of the ""prettiest explosions"" award.The alternate fire modes for the weapons is a good addition.Travelling anywhere in this game is fun. I spent most of my time just flying around the map.Meh:No pistols/dual-fire weapons, they were nice but I don't miss them too badly.New way of sorting weapons. Allows for any two weapons to be carried.Battles in the world between the Rebals and the Black Hand/Loyalists are cool to take part in a few times, but mostly don't do anything interesting and get boring very quickly.Balloons on grapples, kinda useless in combat and the novelty of sending people skywards wears off quicker than you would think.Vehicles have amunition counts now, was probably put in to force you to be more flexable in combat. But I never ran out of ammo before my tank exploded or I flew into the ground anyway.The map is waaaay less interesting than JC2 or JC3.Cons:No grenades... Seriously who thought this was a good idea?No C4 explosives. This would go really well with the new grapple mechanic, not sure why they put in the balloons instead.This is the big one. ""Liberating"" a province now requires you to complete a specific mission in that province. As opposed to blowing up everything as in JC3. These get really boring really quickly.Once you are done, you're done. No replayability.OpinionsLiterally eveything that has changed from JC3 would be fine and I would have no problem shouting from the rooftop that you should buy this game if it wasn't for the stupid decision to go away from the ""liberate a province by blowing up all of the red stuff"" to the ""liberate a province by doing this mission"" core gameplay loop.As of writing this I have played about six of these liberation missions and I have exactly zero enthusiasm to play any more. The whole set of game mechanics seem setup for you to have loads of different and interesting ways to go about rapidly deconstructing everything around you in a glorious cacophony of fire and noise. But then the liberation missions (escort missions, push this button over there missions, defend this thing missions) feel constrictive and empty.If these were switched out for JC3 style ""explode everything in this area and you win"" type liberations, then the game would be excellent.As it is, all of the peripheral side tasks and environment are epic, the liberation missions that make up the core of the gameplay, kinda poo.If you are new to the series, get JC3 instead.";0;119,6;25/12/2018;256;12;;2.0
32;Action;00,00;"Well, here I am, just finished the game.I'll be honest with you, I was really looking forward to this game, and whilst I did most certainly enjoy it, im still disappointed. Im going to start this review with the negatives, and end on a more happy note.Though the game length isn't short, took me about 20 hours to complete around 75%, it still feels a lot shorter than Rise of the Tomb Raider. I can't really explain why, but I found myself quite suprised as to how fast the story was progressing.Speaking of the story, I hate to say it, but it's really quite bad. All the characters are pretty much bland and without any character or personality (with the exception of Lara and Jonah). I guarantee you you won't care about anyone else. Also the story just really lacks depth, I didnt get invested in it, at any point.Then we get to another really weird issue. The dialogue. Whilst the quality of the audio is excellent, I can't help but notice quest givers pause a lot longer inbetween sentences than what I would declare a normal way of speaking. It get's really bad when you are sitting at camp when Lara is narrating, sometimes she pauses like 5 seconds before saying anything. Literally half the time I think shes done talking and then suddenly theres more. It's just weird and feels unnatural.Then we get to the gameplay, first of all, I find there to be a lack of enemies. Sure you do fight quite regularly, whether it's stealth or combat, but, I just ended the game feeling like I hadn't really done much in the way of combat. In the trailers you see this cool scene in a dark jungle where Lara is taking out some soldiers, whilst this is in the game, its literally one quick sequence where you have no weapons, just a knife. There is stealth in the rest of the game of course, but I was hoping there were more areas like the one I just mentioned, instead of one litte sequence. Then we get to the ""hubs"". Do you feel like talking to everyone? I most certainly didn't because of the bad story, so good luck with that. I literally walked past most random civilian dialogue people simply muttering the phrase ""I dont give a sh*t"". Sure it gives you information about secrets and possible tomb locations, but as I said, I just didnt care.Then theres another issue: You will be locked from selecting certain outfits and using certain weapons for a big portion of the game. Now don't get me wrong, I understand the reasoning behind this, it's to ""blend in"", but I just found it really , really annoying. To end on a more positive note:The tombs are excellent.The new climbing mechanics work wellThe graphics are amazing.Excellent voice acting for Lara and JonahStealth is just as good as it was, though really easy due to bad AI.To sum up, if you liked Rise of the Tomb Raider, you will like this, BUT, you will feel it is inferior.I do recommend this game, but I would wait for a sale, especially if you loved Rise of the Tomb Raider.Seeing as though this is the last game in the trilogy, I do want it said that I really do hope they make more of these games, they are a joy to play.";1;48,2;19/09/2018;438;8;;4.0

32;Action;00,00;"MY REVIEW OF THE SHADOW OF THE TOMB RAIDER GAME  In South America  The most significant difference that always characterised each Tomb Raider episode: the change of location. My preference is with the colder climate (this also means that this episode omits the Endurance mode) but it is always nice to see how a new location can affect gameplay. Areas with battle now allow Lara to go back into hiding by bathing in mud. An interesting concept - I particularly liked how she could move along the wall out of plain sight due to the overgrown flora.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NN7UCIAHsQ&t=17s  Trinity  The bad guys return and Lara now encounters a leader called Pedro Dominguez. It is nice to add a face to Trinity this time and Pedro actually knows more of Lara than she thinks. Cutscenes are amazing with the usual high-quality voice acting on everybody's part and there is increased focus on Lara's childhood and father this time. There are a couple of twists here an there - as usual later on a new form of enemy appears to make the story more exciting. This alone does not make the plot totally different so the creators decided to include more peril by choosing artifacts with great power. Let's just say that Lara's race against Trinity has time factored in.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwljTbmEjvw&t=4s  Gameplay  You know how the developers add new elements even when it is not necessary. Gameplay in the previous two instalments was fast and dynamic enough. Still, there's new gear, of course. Overhang climbing is now possible with the use of special boots. I think this feature was unnecessary and thank god no puzzles were based on this. Grappling down from cliffs, however, is a nice new addition. We find all sorts of materials - beside upgrading our weapons we can craft pieces of clothing. Upper and lower body pieces are available but we can also acquire full body outfits. These add bonuses so getting dressed before a fight we can decide if we intend to aim for a more stealthy approach or go full guns blazing by putting on something that gives Lara health regeneration. And, naturally, we can give Lara the ""old"" look by applying skins from previous games (this is a purely cosmetic choice here).Other than these small changes or additional stuff gameplay mechanics remain the same. I liked the inclusion of air pockets during underwater sequences which made it possible to increase the time spent in such areas. Once again Lara can decipher various monuments (her language skills increase gradually) and there are tons of relics and letters to be found out there. You'll return to previous locations by using the camp system several times just to get that 100% completion.Graphics appear to be enhanced once again. I cannot comment on the latest RTX technology but everything else looked stunning as usual. Two more small adjustments done to walkthroughs: there are difficulty settings we can choose from but they are broken down into various elements we can adjust separately. Additionally, there is a possibility to make immersion better by allowing the NPCs to use their native language instead of English.  Longevity  What else to say about Shadow of Tomb Raider? Another great entry in the series where there are more and much bigger tombs. The DLCs also focus on these extra challenges. The hub area we visit appears to be greater and there are many side missions to complete. It's worth investing time into these as getting the rewards will make Lara stronger. There is a New Game+ mode available with additional skills we can purchase only during this second walkthrough.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdEfROL2Wx8&t=340s  I had fun with the latest instalment. The puzzles were sometimes annoying (oh boy the one in the church was just awful!) but gave me a good challenge, nonetheless. Of all 3 episodes this one has the most interesting story and definitely the most satisfying end game boss battle.";1;219,3;23/06/2022;132;21;;8.0
32;Action;00,00;"TL:DR if you expect a lot of combat from this game, do not buy it. If you want decent puzzles, stealth based action scenes or you are a Tomb Raider fan -old or new- in general, go for it. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is not a perfect game, it has its flaws -to some A LOT of them- but I believe it depends on what you expect from this game. As an old Tomb Raider fan, I expected puzzles that were not solvable in the very first minute, a strong Lara depiction and a little bit of action to add some spice to the game. I got what I wanted, but certainly there are some features I thought that could've been a lot better. - Skill system is pretty much useless in this game. If you played the previous games, you will recognize most of the skills that are present in Shadow. Those skills worked fine in 2013 and Rise because there were a lot of combat moments in them, but in Shadow there aren't a lot of combat. So weapon crafting and upgrading is pretty useless as well. Sometimes you won't even have your weapons other than your bow to fight the enemies anyway, sometimes you are forced to kill enemies only with your knife. -The game had many ads saying that you were going to be in the Amazon jungle this time, dealing with predators and wild life, but there aren't a lot of moments like that either. Only a few jaguars, piranhas and eels and that's pretty much the wild life you're going to witness. I expected more since Amazon was called the Green Hell by the conquistadors.-  It's a bit shorter than the previous games. The story is decent, it's not mind blowing nor lame. There are some moments you can see them coming from a mile away, but I thought it was interesting to deal with Trinity once again. Although I feel Lara has not become THE Lara we know, it's still nice to see her questioning her environment -even if she destroys or takes most of the artifacts she finds in her raidings lol - If you like parkouring, then you will love this game. Especially with the new difficulty settings, you can set the exploration difficulty on whatever suits you. - More swimming. I think this lacked in the previous games, so it was nice to have some underwater areas you can explore, be careful with the piranhas though.- There are more crypts and optional tombs in Shadow, and some of them are GREAT. Most of them have great atmosphere where you truly feel you are in a place that has been hidden and no man has set foot on the ground for a very long time. - I'm not even mentioning the graphics, the game looks pretty neat. It needs a bit more optimization as of October 2nd, but still it's a feast for the eyes.- This may not be important to many, but when I play games that are based on historical facts, then I want them to be researched thoroughly so they will be accurate. Sadly that is not the case here, you are going to see a lot of Mayan symbols in Incan tombs. The story tries to fix this mistake, but it's not doing a very believable job. Even the artifacts you find here and there, they have wrong information written about them. You can say ""this is a game, not a history lesson"" and that's fair ^_^ I just think if you are giving information about a REAL historical object, then at least do it right.Overall, this is an enjoyable game but I would recommend you to wait for a discount.";1;71,6;2/10/2018;276;8;;7.0

32;Action;00,00;First off let me say that while this is a negative review, SOTTR is not a terrible game. It's a well polished AAA that just happens to have enough issues to make it a disappointing end to the reboot trilogy. Steam does not let me rate a game out of 10 and I'm unwilling to give it a thumbs up, so here we are.Let's start with what the game does well. The environmental design in this game is superb. The variation isn't huge because there's no globe hopping in this game (you'll be seeing a lot of jungle,) but the attention to detail and art direction meant I never cared. This is a beautiful game to look at.Eidos Montreal has also done a very good job of porting this to the PC. I read early reviews saying there were some performance issues but a month after release those seem to have been resolved. I'm running and FX6300 and GTX970 with 8GB RAM. It's not a beast of a machine by any means (the CPU is most definitely a bottleneck,) but I was still able to run the game on the 'High' preset at 1080p and achieve a solid 60fps in closed areas and 45fps in open areas and cities. Whilst talking about graphics I also want to mention that the temporal anti-aliasing in this game is top notch, there wasn't a jaggy edge in sight.Moving onto gameplay, this is where things become a bit more mixed. On the good side of things the platforming is as fluid as the previous two games, but more importantly, Eidos have finally managed to get the 'right' amount of actual tomb raiding into the game. Tomb Raider 2013 really suffered for having really poor tombs that felt like little more than small caves with basic physics puzzles. Crystal Dynamics improved this a fair bit in Rise of the Tomb Raider with longer tombs and more complex puzzles (even if the theming of the tombs wasn't always very tomb-like). With Shadow of the Tomb Raider we're finally back to something fans of the pre-reboot games might recognize. Really lengthy tombs with complex multi-stage puzzles. I really can't understate how much better this aspect of the game is compared to the previous two.The problems with the gameplay start to become apparent a few hours in when you realise that you're almost getting too much of a good thing. Whereas the previous reboot games would intersperse sections of tomb raiding and exploration with gun fights, the combat in SOTTR has been seriously reduced. And when I say reduced I mean that other than a couple of dudes near the start, you won't be shooting anything other than guinea pigs and parrots for the first two thirds of the game. I can see why this has happened. the previous two reboot games got flak from some quarters for having too much gun-play. Personally I enjoyed those sections in TR2013 and ROTTR and don't think they had too much shooting, they just had too little tomb raiding. This lack of combat becomes a real problem because it means that the tomb raiding and exploration sections of SOTTR are just too long. What is actually really good gameplay when looked at by itself becomes tedious and repetitive. Something I really should have been enjoying was starting to make me feel bored.Worse than the lack of combat is the fact that what little combat does exist is just not very good. Eidos have introduced some new stealth mechanics and seem hell bent on forcing you to use them. You can now hide in bushes growing up walls which isn't really any different from hiding in bushes on the ground, it's just a new animation. You can also cover yourself in mud to hide from night vision goggles. There are three (I think,) instances in the game where you can use the mud mechanic. The mud patches are placed right at the entrance to a zone, to the point where you can't really progress to the combat without covering yourself in mud. You're given so little agency over this mechanic and it seems to make so little difference to the gameplay that I can't really figure out why they bothered to include it. My only guess is that they had something similar in the advertising cinematic so felt they needed to include it in the game.The enemy AI is clearly tuned towards the player using stealth. If you break cover they have pinpoint accuracy. Not that you will anyway because there are sections of the game where despite actually still having all your weapons (you haven't had them stripped or lost them down a waterfall or anything,) the game will only let you stealth kill with your knife. Unfortunately killing in stealth isn't particularly fun either since the AI is as dumb as a bag of rocks. If you've ever maxed out stealth in Skyrim and had an enemy NPC not see you as you crouch right next to them and the corpse of their buddy, you'll know what I'm talking about. It might seem like I'm talking about the combat in this game a lot but it really is just such a massive step backwards compared to the previous two games.Combat is not the only problem with the gameplay though some of the others are directly related to it. The talent tree for example is lifted almost wholesale from Rise. Ninety percent of those talents are combat related and are therefore useless for most of the game. This really hinders any feeling of character progression. The crafting system likewise suffers since it's focused on upgrading weapons and armour which will rarely be used. The armour sets in the game do at least have some non-combat bonuses which improve yields on foraging and the like. However the main hub of the game will force you to use a disguise costume which has no bonuses at all. Yes, you read that right. You will spend the game earning armour sets which you then can't use for large sections of it.Lastly, lets talk about the story. I'll be brief to avoid spoilers. It's not very good. To be fair, the reboot games have never had the strongest writing but it has always been 'good enough'. TR2013 had the most cohesive narrative since it was almost entirely self contained. Rise expanded on the role of Trinity and offered quite a lot of backstory if you read all the collectable documents. SOTTR has very little set up. You get a McGuffin waved in your face at the start of the game by Trinity and then you won't see it or them again until the final third. The time in between is filled with Lara's introspection on her life and journey so far. It has the potential to really build her character but really just comes across as a bit whiny and self centred. By far the most relatable character is her friend Jonah, almost to the point where I was wishing he was the protagonist.The 'big bad' in SOTTR is the biggest let down. We've had two games building up Trinity as some world spanning illuminati type organisation and yet the 'big bad' feels so loosely connected to them. I think you could probably remove all references to Trinity from the game and it would make no difference to the character of 'big bad'. Considering this is the final instalment in the trilogy it feels like it offers zero closure when it come to the main antagonists of the series.tl.drGOOD:  Graphics  Platforming / exploration  Tombs / puzzles  PerformanceBAD:  Story  Pacing / not enough combat  Enforced stealth, with poor stealth mechanics  Talents, weapons and armour are useless for most of the gameRATING: 6.5 / 10;0;56,3;17/10/2018;327;4;;6.0

On this third iteration, everything just feels bland, old, and dare I say boring? I don't know. I'm playing it and (I think I'm) kind of enoying myself, but nowhere near the fun I had with the previous two entries. With those, I didn't play other games until I finished them...with this one, I find myself playing it for an hour or two then wandering off to another game or doing something else entirely. It just can't hold my interest for very long because while it's a perfectly functional game, it's just a by the numbers game.

33;RPG; 226,99;If you manage to find this review buried under the other 10 000, and you're thinking about buying the game, please read this:Those who claim that there's no link between the 8 characters and their respective stories didn't play the game until the end. It is not obvious at first, but nearing the end of a few chapters you'll notice that some characters refer to a thing in particular, hinting at what's coming after you finish all chapters: the real ending. Once you finish all 32 of them, don't uninstall OT right away. Google how to find the post-game dungeon, THAT is the real ending. It's a shame that only 5,8% of the players experienced it, as the achievement indicates. It is understandable though, as getting into that dungeon is not exactly a straightforward process.;1;70,1;12/04/2023;477;5;;8.0

33;RPG; 226,99;"After spending more than 200 hours with Octopath Traveler across Switch and PC, scrutinizing it in an objective fashion was an uncomfortable prospect because it's one of my favorite games. however, in doing so, the conclusion is Octopath Traveler is more a solid proof of concept than a masterpiece, with ample room for improvement in a sequel. For every aspect in which it excels, another is middle-of-the-road. for every system with respectable depth, another is a puddle, so it's only fair they're given equal weight.In a relatively uncommon move for the genre, rather than focus wholly on an overarching story about saving the world from Big Evil, Octopath follows the individual journeys of eight characters with wildly different personalities and goals through their personal struggles and triumphs, large and small. While this can initially feel like a breath of fresh air, some players will find it difficult to maintain interest in the ordinary and mundane lives of everyday heroes, and I suspect many will fail to see all eight of them through to the end.Dialogue is only partially voiced and can best be described as serviceable, and cutscenes tend to drag on a bit too long because of unnatural pauses.It makes conversation stiff and dull. This is amplified by the fact you'll be expecting the next line to be voiced, but it's a coin toss whether it actually will be or not. The content of the characters' stories is fairly well-written so it's a shame the temptation to skip cutscenes is likely to grow with each passing chapter.The world in Octopath Traveler is totally non-linear: you may begin your journey as whomever you wish, go wherever you'd like—even dangerous places you've no business yet—and recruit other characters as you see fit up to a party of four. Members can be switched out at any time within taverns, except for your main character who cannot be removed until you finish chapter four of their personal story. This will be well into the game, so ensure you set out on your journey with a character you want to keep around.Besides their easily distinguished identities, each character is also intended to have ""path actions"" unique to them which can be used on NPCs outside of combat. two do in fact boast unique abilities but the other six unfortunately overlap significantly. Therion, the brooding thief who trusts no one due to the lingering trauma of past betrayals, is the only character who can steal from NPCs or pick the locks on purple chests littered throughout the world—invaluable. Tressa, an intrepid merchant from a quaint seaside village, is the only character who can purchase certain items which can't be stolen from NPCs.As for the other six: Ophelia, the cleric, can guide villagers, convincing them to join you temporarily and allowing you to call upon them to aid you in battle. So can Primrose, the dancer—the ability is just named allure instead of guide. The same goes for challenging NPCs to a duel with warrior Olberic or provoking them into it with hunter H'aanit. scrutinizing them for information and secrets with Cyrus the scholar or instead inquiring nicely with Alfyn the apothecary.The overlap in path actions means you can generally take either choice in a pair and be no worse off from lacking the alternative. their class is ultimately of little consequence because of a job system in which any character can learn the non-path class skills of another once you've visited the appropriate shrine. This makes some characters feel like must-haves and others interchangeable, which somewhat ruins the tough party composition decisions you'd need to make if every character was awesome in their own way. At the same time, it offers a great deal of freedom in building your perfect party.Homogenization of what characters can offer is furthered by investing in the admittedly wonderful job system: Each character can take on a second class and unlock its skills using job points earned from battle. as new class skills are unlocked, passive skills from that class will also be unlocked and each character can equip four of those at once, from any class(es) in which they've trained. Technically, every character can know every ability and passive from every single class, though they can only have one additional job at a time, and two characters can't equip the same second class simultaneously.Identifying and exploiting enemy weaknesses is at the core of combat in Octopath: There are six weapon types and six element types in the game and enemies are typically vulnerable to several, though you won't know to which until you use that attack type on them for the first time. Striking an enemy with a weapon or element they're weak against will bring down their shield counter and eventually ""break"" them, causing them to be stunned for the next round and take additional damage from attacks in the meantime. Some bosses will shift weaknesses after recovering from a break, or have them grayed out until certain conditions are met.Boost points (BP) help to keep combat interesting and balanced. each character begins battle with one BP and can hold a maximum of five. For each turn you don't spend BP, you'll gain one on the next turn, and you can use up to three at once to boost the magnitude of abilities. The most expensive class-exclusive skills, called divine skills, can only be triggered when fully boosted and have especially powerful effects, such as doubling a character's actions for a few rounds or causing spells to affect all characters instead of just one. The BP system adds a much-needed element of strategy and resource management to battles.If you're a fan of Octopath's graphical style, it's gorgeous. if you're not, the effects you would've been stuck with on Switch, such as heavy depth of field from a tilt shift effect, can be disabled by mods which can be found on the Steam forums. Other than those effects, what you see in the screenshots is what you get.The game's flawed dualities go on and on and prevent much from being exceptional. Although the eight regions have distinct biomes and there's great graphical variety throughout the world and its combat backgrounds, every area has essentially one thoroughfare with many short, dead-end paths branching off that lead to treasure chests before sending you back. there are few real secrets, puzzles, or anything out of the ordinary to break up that pattern.In the same way, there are seemingly hundreds of beautifully drawn enemies but many are merely re-skins in another of the six elements, or doppelgängers possessing only a different color palette and another set of weaknesses. Many enemies, even if completely different from one another, are effectively the same.Finally, while there are three villages in each region and a seemingly great number of places to explore, they begin to feel like hubs for picking up a few quests then robbing and interrogating NPCs who feel like fleshy treasure chests more than living beings. Save for the few lucky enough to be quest givers, this isn't helped by the line or two of dialogue they've been given straight out of a generic 1990s JRPG.If there's one thing anyone can appreciate about Octopath Traveler, it's the soundtrack: not only does each region, character, and story-related battle have its own theme with motifs that tie into one another, the composition, instrumentation, and variety is impeccable. This is one of the very few games that prominently features a variety of real woodwind instruments. The  soundtrack is no small part of why this is one of my personal favorites so, even if you don't end up playing the game, consider listening to it elsewhere.Overall, Octopath Traveler succeeds in enjoyably modernizing the archaic more than it fails, and new IPs willing to stand out and take risks while trying to bring back something once beloved deserve a bit of leniency—it's a good game that will hopefully achieve greatness in the next installment.";1;104,4;11/01/2020;208;5;;5.0

33;RPG; 226,99;"My feelings on Octopath Traveller are certainly mixed. If you asked me if I would recommend the game at the halfway-point, I would have said no.But after playing through everything the game had to offer, I have to give this game a positive review.Mechanically, this is a very good RPG. The combat system, path actions, item/stats progression are well designed.Graphically this game is unique in its own way, as you can see in the screenshots. The lighting is exceptionally good.The story is my main point of concern. While being very good overall, it is designed in a such a weird way that it had trouble sucking me in.The stories you witness while following the 8 party members are, each on their own, good but rather small storylines. Yet, as hoped, each of these 8 stories hint to the greater plot behind the scenes.This builds curiosity towards the bigger world lore and anticipation towards the great big confrontation that is often hinted at.However, due to the level requirements of each characters' chapters, it is hard to become fully engaged in any story. Finishing all chapters 2 of each character can easily take you up to 30 hours play time.Then the repetitiveness becomes apparent: Every character has 4 chapters. After a while you start to realize that each chapter is structured in the same way.- You get a recap of the characters story- You get some new story- You run a dungeon- You fight a boss- You get a conclusion and/or a setup for the next chapterThis does get kinda repetitive doing it 32 times.After finishing all chapters of every character, I was hungry for the final big confrontation where all the stories finally intertwine... But even after seeing the credits and hoping for a ""final chapter"", nothing came.Thankfully, the steam achievements showed me that there is indeed a final boss somewhere.Having to use google, i found out that there are 2 certain questlines of (random) sidequests that you have to complete before you can finally face the real final boss.There it all finally comes to a big climax and the game, in hindsight, also succeeded on bringing a great story, even if I think they could have gone about it in a better way.";1;92,0;26/11/2021;121;0;;7.0
33;RPG; 226,99;"square enix turn-based jrpg. you know what you signed up for when you buy this game. let's get straight to the point. like: + 2.5D works super well and is a refreshing sight for a game that's supposed to be old-school. the sprite work is amazing and my god the effects are pretty. definitely the pinnacle of aesthetic of this kind+ sound design plus the OST are absolutely top tier. your footsteps echo in the cave and you can hear the stream flowing in the distance. again pushing the standards for this kind of game+ solid combat system. everything is labelled clearly and it's never confusing what you can or can't do during a fight+ the main cast. i liked all 8 main characters and especially enjoyed the fact that you are allowed to choose your 'main' at the beginning. choice is good. (you get the option to swap your main out down the line dw about it)+ voice acting. the cutscenes are already well animated and the VA made them shine. although not every scene is VA'd, the ones that are are never boring to sit through+ design for all the available jobs in game. each of them fill a niche (dps, aoe break, buffs/debuffs, healing...) and each character can equip up to two, encouraging diverse builds+ honorable mention to the fact that most elemental spells in this game are aoe. makes grinding super easy and painless when you can just rip it and screenwipe... thank godthe thing is, if you look at this game objectively, it's not like this game tries to reinvent the wheel. you can definitely see the 'square enix-ness' of the story and character design. however what i really appreciated was the fact that they decided to take what they know, and present them in a modern, fresh way. ""2D old school turn-based jrpg"" screams ancient but this game is anything but. that being said...ehh:- i personally didn't mind it, but after the first few hours one can definitely tell the 'formula' of the game progression. go to new place, talk to everyone in town, cutscene, dungeon, boss, back to town, go to new place... you get the gist. ""that's all jrpgs"" but this one especially more so with their formula. definitely can feel 'same-y' after a few loops of this and might need a break to recharge- some character/job combo are definitely more OP than the rest, to the point that some may feel obligated to follow the 'meta'. tressa/runelord is just so extremely powerful that it feels like a tressa-only job. this is a single player jrpg though so you CAN avoid playing the meta but it's there for you to take advantage of- completionist's hell. most achievement are easily done by just simply playing through the game (side note: these are the most spoiler-y achievement i've ever seen in my life holy balls how hard is it to just say ""cleared character chapter x"" LOL), but the last few achievements... dear lord almost feels like they DON'T want you to get them. solo traveler, speedrun, all items/hidden items/enemy weakness/chests/locations... oh did i mention that there are missables in this game? multiple playthroughs are required if you want to actually 100% the game, obviously not a problem if you are happy with the one playthrough you do- speaking of a good jrpg time, without spoilers, the optional superboss is kind of a tedious design. you need to do a 8-boss rush (dw by the time you get there they're a cakewalk) before you can challenge it... but get this, not only can you not leave after going in, you can't save your game either. meaning every time you lose to this boss you have to go through the boss rush AGAIN, which is just an arbituary time sink for... no good reason? i personally only did the rush twice and that was already tiring. oh yeah by the way you also have to use all 8 of your characters in the fight, so good luck people who only have 4 of them levelled and geared. it's doable, but very very tight. this is at the tail end of the game though, so you have plenty of time to build up before tackling this - to add onto the point above... imo a good 97% of this game is easy, outside of the one(1) superboss. if you want a teeth-grinding fist-tight hardcore rpg action, this game might not be for you. xp gain isn't painful in this game and you can easily outscale the game even without grinding. i downed the superboss with characters that aren't even lv50it took me around 68 hours to beat the final chapter for all characters and then some for sidequest and superboss. for the most part, you will definitely get your money's worth on this game if you are craving that square enix jrpg goodness. if you WANT to get into jrpgs, well, this is a pretty good game for a first-timer too.";1;80,7;10/03/2022;122;4;;8.0
33;RPG; 226,99;This game is EXTREMELY slow to start.There's a huge difference in gameplay the moment you assemble a 4-man party, and then another huge mix-up when you unlock sub-classes.If you didn't know about any of these features beforehand then you might've quit the game quite early.Once you obtain these mechanics though, the game picks up. Team composition becomes deep. New strategies become available. It's like a whole new game and you'll start to enjoy yourself.If you're a player who will read anything and everything then you'll appreciate the sheer amount of work the developers put into loading the world with dialogue and context clues. When you hear people complain about the lack of story, it's because the premise of each character's story is shallow.The characters you play aren't the centre of a cataclysmic event, but rather are dealing with their own problems in an extremely well fleshed-out world.Most of the narrative is told outside of the main chapters, and by collecting all the little bits of context the game throws at you, you can start to see how everything fits together.;1;88,7;23/04/2021;106;0;;8.0

Check out: United Critics!🎮 GameplayIn OCTOPATH TRAVELER, you begin your journey by choosing one of the eight playable characters. No matter which one you choose, the game will still start and play out the same. you will just start the game by completing the first chapter of your selected character. The game is separated into eight stories, each one containing four 'chapters'. You can choose which stories/chapters you want to complete first. as there is no order you need to follow, and each story has a respective character.  Sadly, characters will never interact in each other's stories, other than the sparse travel banter.The in-game world is quite large and contains several different locations for you to explore. Upon entering a town, you will be able to visit some important buildings, as well as being able to quick travel to that town in the future. This makes it much easier to travel to where you need to be in the later chapters.To start a character's chapter, you must have them currently assigned in your party. When you enter a town you will be prompted to continue a character's story and you may either continue it or choose to continue another time.In the many towns you will venture to, there are plenty of things to do within. You can purchase items at the provision shop or weapons/armor from the weapon shop that will greatly assist you while battling.While in towns, you will have the option to complete side-quests, for which you will be rewarded. A side quest is marked by the orange star on the mini-map. When you confront an NPC with a speech bubble, you may notice some white icons. These are known as 'path actions', and are a character's special ability. Simply press J and select which path action you wish to take. Depending on your current party, different abilities will be available to use.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2091593079⚔ CombatOCTOPATH TRAVELER uses a turn based combat system when it comes to fighting enemies. While wondering through any non-town map area, you have the chance to enter into battle. The screen will fade black, and then clear into a battle scene, where the enemies are on the left, and the characters on the right. The turn order bar is shown at the top of the screen, and the current attacking enemy or character is shown on the left of the bar, followed by the next attackers. Each character has three main stats: health points (HP), skill points (SP), and battle points (BP). HP determines how much damage a character can take before becoming incapacitated.When you start a battle, you will begin with one BP. BP is depicted by a little gold circle under a character's name. You can use BP to double, triple or quadriple an attack (one BP for x2, two BP for x3 etc.). SP is needed to use a character's skill abilities, which offer stronger elemental physical and non-physical attacks. Character skills can be unlocked by spending 'job points' (JP) in the skills tab of the menu. Unlocking will grant access to more skills and support skills - which are certain benefits not affected by equipped weapons/armor or status ailments. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2083983370All enemies have little boxes displayed under their names with a question mark inside. These are undiscovered monster vulnerabilities, and by attacking with different weapons or elements, you can reveal different weaknesses. Whenever you make an attack that the monster is vulnerable against. you will deal extra damage as well as reducing a monster's defense (illustrated by blue shield icon) by one. When you deplete a monster's defense to zero, you will 'break' their defense and they will become stunned and lose a turn. During this time, all attacks will deal more damage.Status ailments can cause positive and negative effects on enemies or allies, and can be acquired through random chance or apothecary skills and item usage. A status ailment may last a number of turns. Degrading ailments such as poison take effect after each characters turn.After battle, your characters will gain XP to increase level. When entering the final chapters of the game, 'grinding' battles to level up characters to make them strong enough to continue becomes a necessity. For most - including me - this is a very dull and boring part of the game, but the soundtrack enhances the experience to make it 'bearable' enough to continue.💻 GraphicsOCTOPATH TRAVELER uses pixel art graphics known as 'HD-2D' to give the game a retro NES look while remaining visually appealing to the modern age. The game is very easy on the eyes. and the pixel-like art is colorful and crisp.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2083983250🎶 AudioA key component of OCTOPATH TRAVELER are the multiple in-game soundtracks. A soundtrack will always be playing while in-game, whether you are exploring a town, battling monsters or wandering around the map. Overall, I'd say the music has been very well made, and even the best music I've heard. The soundtrack creates a more involving and invigorating experience while in battle, and makes you enjoy battle scenes a lot more.While most of the game characters don't speak, when they do, they sound great! They really add a much needed part of the game, and creates a much better story-telling experience.👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 AudienceThis game is great for anyone who enjoys old-style RPGs, or just pixel art in general. To enjoy playing, you'd need a little patience to let the stories play out, as well as the many and sometimes long battles.🔥 PerformanceThe game was played well on my system setup with video settings set to high:Operating system: Windows 10 ProProcessor: Ryzen 3 2200G @3.5/3.7GHzGraphics Card: GALAX GeForce® GTX 1650 Super EX 4GBMemory: 16GB DDR4 @2666HtzDisplay: 1920x1080 @60HtzStorage: 480GB SSDI achieved 60FPS at all times, albeit dropping when moving from one part of the map to another.❓ ConclusionOCTOPATH TRAVELER is a well-made pixel art JRPG with eight well structured stories. I recommend definitely playing, but for a lot of people the high price is a negative factor. For the amount of content this game provides (around 100 hours in one playthrough), I view it as a fair price for the game. If you aren't looking to pay full price, wishlist the game and wait for the next 50% off sale.Like our reviews? Check out: United Critics!;1;50,1;10/05/2020;141;5;;7.0

34;Adventure; 106,90;I went into this game really hopeful. Episode one was great, the atmosphere was great, the story hook was great and everything felt really immersive. It felt like you really were in the shoes of Sean, desperately trying to protect himself and his brother in such a messed up situation. The only gripe I had with it was the facial animations were practically nonexistent and the voice acting was a little rough, and it brought me out of the story at times. I thought little of it, however, as it was still the first episode and episodes were to take longer to come out than the first game. When the second episode came out, I was more than a little disappointed by the lack of facial animation, but the voice acting did seem better. The second episode, story-wise still felt like a natural progression to the story, though the time-skip was a little off putting. Everything still worked, the direction the story was going was clear, the stakes were clear and it still felt immersive. I had a couple issues with how they handled a few things, but again, I enjoyed it more than I had issues with it.Then comes episode three. Still no improvement on the facial animations, the voice acting was worse than the first episode, the time skip mixed caused another bump in my ability to remain connected with the story and dear all gods Daniel became the most annoying little scamp I have ever been forced to play alongside. The first bits I could have gladly ignored if they continued with having lovable and relatable characters, but Daniel went from your kind of annoying little brother to a total brat. Sean is then blamed for this transition for doing little other than having other friends completely despite the fact Daniel has his own other friend too. The story takes an odd turn, which could be justified were the execution a little better, but the time skip gets rid of any execution at all, you are simply thrown into it and it is apparently what you have been doing for a while. The time skips feel less like a way to keep the story going and more like a way to ignore doing extra writing, and  the story is suffering greatly for it.The fourth episode (Actual spoilers, from here on) is what managed to make me lose faith in the game. We are greeted to yet another time skip, Sean having been in the hospital for a decent chunk of time and about to go on trial and Daniel is missing. Now, I was forgiving and thought we were in for an interesting start with the hospital escape, then a scene happens that seriously rubs me the wrong way. Sean takes a break from driving to sleep and it turns out he is on the private property of racists. I do not know if this can be avoided, but for me at least it ended with Sean getting the living heavens beat out of him. And then nothing happens. The scene does not matter later in the story, it is just there to give Sean some more pain on top of all the pain he is already in. I do not know if they added it in either because they wanted their main character to suffer more or if they thought this was clever writing relating to topical events happening right now, but the scene could have been removed from the game and literally the game would be the exact same. That is not good writing.Then we come to the part where we finally see Daniel again and he is in some sort of cult and praised as a sign from god. All immersion with the story I held onto was thrown out the window. This is so far away from the original presented story that I do not even know where the writers are taking this anymore and trust me when I say that is not a good thing. Sean is then promptly blamed for being a bad brother, despite all of the constant sacrafices he makes to keep Daniel happy and healthy. I will bring that up later, because if you have played the game, you know exactly where this goes from bad to full on unhealthy and problematic. Sean then gets to meet his mother, who I guess shows her face again to save Daniel despite abandoning both her children and her husband. You can tell they try to make you like this character, but as someone who has had both parents abandon them, it didn't work. Maybe for some people it did but her only excuse is being forced into the role of a mother by society, so she couldn't live out her dreams. That pissed me off so much, I did not have words. Maybe it would have been fine if she still remained a part of their lives, or if she even at least wrote them letters or at least let them know she still cared but no. She was gone without a trace and we are supposed to be okay with that because society made her. That is beyond upsetting and treats Sean and Daniel less like children and more like burdens to her. Finally, everyone bands together to free Daniel. I really could not care less about anyone except for Sean, who is the only character in this game I still like. Which is just wonderful as we are treated to him getting beat up over and over to prove that he really does care about Daniel. What in the ever living hell did Sean do to deserve that? He has shown nothing but concern over his brother who has constantly disregarded him and acted like a brat. Heavens forbid he spend a bit of time with friends while still taking care of his brother. I really, really do not know what the writers are going with here, that scene was disturbing for reasons I do not think they were intending. The only way I can think this as being anything but poor writing would be if they go with the clever route of actually showcasing this behavior as dangerous and Daniel as an antagonist who refuses to learn. I really think that might be the only saving grace for the story, paired with proper facial animations and voice acting because oh my, did they drop the ball on this episode, so hard the ball shattered and we are left with a bunch of expressionless characters and unfitting voices acting out what can only be described as a soap opera that has gone on so long they needed to go completely off the wall for shock value.;0;3,6;1/10/2019;232;9;;2.0
34;Adventure; 106,90;Loved the first life is strange game. The characters were corny and awkward, just like in any story based around teen drama. However, I always felt engaged in the mystery and pushing the plot forward. The game play was also very satisfying. The power to explore different choices and rewind the clock made it a good match for a narrative style player choice driven game. Life is strange 2 lacks the same charm. It still has the corny writing, but I didn't warm to the characters or the story. It had no grand mystery and game play was less engaging. Firstly because you don't play as the brother with the powers and the powers themselves aren't as interesting or as satisfying as time manipulation. I get what they were trying to do, but it just kept falling flat. I kept playing out of obligation, rather than intrigue. I wanted to like this game, but I just left feeling underwhelmed.So overall, not terrible. Just a hard act to follow.;0;14,5;1/06/2020;257;3;;7.0

34;Adventure; 106,90;I played ‚Life is Strange 2‘ a year ago and I still can’t get it out of my head. I’ve never had such an intense experience with a game. Ever!I’m an over 50 years old guy and I couldn’t stop crying when I finished the last episode. The emotions hurled me out of my regular life for a complete week and even now, after so many months, I still can’t listen to the soundtrack or some of the trailers without heavy sobbing.I like emotional and story driven games and I’ve played many, but non of them had such an impact on me, not even LiS1.I tried to play the game as realistically as possible, which means I never went back once I made a decision. I regretted some of them, but that made it even better, because that’s how it is in real life and it makes it easier to identify with the main character Sean.There were a few moments where I missed alternative ways to deal with a situation, where I thought that a character acted illogical or where I felt that something was forced on me, but those were just a handful of negligible moments and forgivable.The game really shines when it comes to pacing, which had always been DONTNOD’s strong suit. I was constantly strung up and afraid of making mistakes that’ll hurt Daniel and/or Sean (remember: no reload for me). But quite often, LiS2 lets the player breath, enjoy the moments of calm and silence. I treasure those moments and I’m glad the devs know where to put them in order to enrich the story.---When the weather is right and I’m in the mood, I snatch my sketchbook, listen to the soundtrack from LiS2 (cry a little) and go for a walk. Sometimes I find something interesting enough to draw or scribble, sometimes not. It doesn’t matter, because every time I remember how I traveled together with Sean and Daniel. It was a year ago and it was “just a game”, but it was also a one-of-a-kind experience and the memories still accompany me.No other game has ever managed this.;1;24,2;20/08/2021;80;0;;10.0

34;Adventure; 106,90;Episode 1 is great.If you're reading all the reviews mentioning politics, just keep in mind that some people are going focus on that more than you might. I played through all of episode 1 expecting a really preachy scene or constant victimization like I had read about in other reviews and it never really happened. I think some people are just primed to take everything as a personal attack.Beyond all that, the story in EP1 sets up an interesting dynamic between surviving and looking after your little sibling. Where in Life is Strange 1 a choice may cause a character to trust you now and work with you later, in LiS 2, a choice might mean the difference between eating or having to steal to live, with each outcome impacting your little brother in positive or negative ways, as he both depends on you, and looks to you to set an example.The choices in EP1 are not earth-shattering, but if you've played LiS 1, you know that your choices make bigger ripples in EP2 or even EP4, so hopefully we see the same growth.Overall, the same level of storytelling is there, but the next few episodes will really dictate whether the story blooms like the first Life is Strange or not.;1;3,2;2/10/2018;206;2;;8.0

34;Adventure; 106,90;So I played through chapters one and two, and to be honest, I doubt I'll end up playing further than that. First off, some disclaimers to be fair to the creators: the gameplay is very smooth and the environments are rich. I would never say that this is a bad game because I don't think it is. I just think that it falls down on what it tries to make the heart of the game experience, which is the two main brothers, and I think that a lot of the mistakes made in the original LiS are carried over here. First off, the brothers: they have their charming moments. Their relationship does feel real, as does Sean's anxiety about taking care of his brother. In the first episode, I enjoyed Daniel as a child character who felt like a child but who could still be helpful in his own right. I think that the second episode really fell down on this, though. Many of the conflicts that crop up in the second episode happen because of Daniel's childish insistence on making dumb decisions, and the narrative forces you to go along with them even if you try to say no. Not only does this leave me as a player feeling like my choices don't matter, but it leads to me resenting Daniel because the narrative has used him as a device to force me into doing things I don't want to for no good reason. (If he were sick and I had to do something dangerous to take care of him, that'd be one thing, but doing dumb things because he's bored puts my teeth on edge.) The beginning of Chapter 3 did nothing to make me feel like this issue would be resolved, since it started off with the player rewarding Daniel for stealing from him. So due to the way the narrative uses Daniel as an obstacle rather than a motivation for player decisions, I find what could have been a charming character insufferable. I would be more patient if he were a real flesh and blood child, but he's a character made of code intended to contribute to an entertaining experience, and in the second chapter, he doesn't for me. Because of this, the investment I had in Sean's growth as a brother figure and the development of their relationship soured. This is on top of the fact that sometimes the game forces you into making decisions you don't want to and can think of a perfectly logical way around, but I think it's unfair to ding games for that too hard. I've only ever seen a couple multi-choice games really allow for completely divergent story lines, and they had armies of programmers for a reason. I get that sometimes you need to railroad the story a bit.There's also the fact that it doesn't feel like this game has any unique gameplay elements the way that the original LiS did. Sean can't manipulate time, and he can't really do anything else either. Daniel is the one with powers, and from a gameplay standpoint, it's a little boring to have someone else be the one with powers and I occasionally order them around (and sometimes they won't even listen to me). I appreciate the risk this was from a story standpoint, but it doesn't really add to the gameplay and the whole thing ends up a bit tacked on, peripheral to the main conflict. Maybe Sean will develop powers later on, but I feel like I gave the game a fair shake by giving it two chapters, and the second chapter really didn't do much to inspire me to keep going. Like I said: I don't think the game is bad. I think that there are a lot of people who would absolutely love it and think Daniel is charming and have no problem with the bland gameplay. But for me personally, this was enough for me to go on to other games.;0;10,2;5/06/2019;277;10;;2.0
34;Adventure; 106,90;"I had a lot of doubts when purchasing this game after reading negative reviews. But after playing all four available at the moment episodes I could say that they're misleading. Most points were like (please forgive me for possible grammar, spelling or lexical mistakes as english is not my native language):1. ""Second game is nothing like first"" - that's quite true, but why it should be? The most missing mechanic (as I could understand) is the time rewind. But this series named ""Life is strange"" and the story follows this line. New mechanics can appeal to someone or not, but you shouldn't just await the game to repeat the same thing over and over. 2. ""Too much politics"" - well, that's a confusing term. So far I hadn't find any government relation to the story at all. Most of it is just people outlook, ideology, perception, stupidity or misconceptions. It's not a bad thing essentially, it's just life.3. ""Too much agressive racism"" - I had several moments where I could think that situations depiced are exeggerated. But after some thought, they're not unambiguous. Sometimes agressors were in the right in their own actions, and we all should understand that out there are a lot of different people with different views. And again, it's not the point of the story and game itself, it's just a several encounters that could be logically explained.4. ""Not enough choices and interactions"" - it could be true. I hadn't replayed it yet (waiting for the last episode before that) and couldn't assess if choices matter. But as for now, I feel that progression follows my own course. Probably I just selected canonic version that was designed at most. Anyway, even if the story is on rails, I, personally, enjoying how it's presented, even if it's just the false appereance of the free will.5. ""No character progression"" - can't argue with this one, mainly because besides two main characters anybody else just ride along in a single episode with short overlaps or flashbacks. It's a bit disappointing, I'd personally wanted to see a bit more involvement of secondary characters in the game. But, is it necessarily bad? The theme is a road trip, escape from ""the bad"" and trying to find a place to belong. If you spend some time to actually listen and interact with the world and people around you (not just rush the storyline) then you could know them a bit more, their stories and a background, and tend to like or dislike them, feel connected.6. ""Telltale clone, cinematic game, no puzzles, etc"" - yeah, that's it. If you don't like following the story, listening to the surroundings, be interested without ""quest taken"" or specific task assigned, explore and inquire, then it's game just not for you. Which is not making a game bad.UPD 21.09.19: 7. Some spoilers ahead for the gamer who hadn't play the game, be warned: ""The Daniel is being complete jerk"". Have you ever tried to put yourself in his shoes? To lost everything in your ""normal life"" and gain a supernatural power? It should change your character. And do not forget, he is pre-teen, he is growing and trying to cut off parental influence and make his own decisions. It's really a bad combo, and that's exactly what is shown there. It's driving me mad, but it's true. My own child without any powers could do the same in the future, and it's perfectly normal :)So, what am I trying to say? I'm glad that I bought this game despite negative reviews. It's a solid product, and I have no complains on it. It's not for everyone, but you could just try it out and find for youself.

35;Action; 66,90;As someone who has played nearly every Resident Evil game (even Resident Evil Gaiden), I think that RE7 is not only a great game on its own, but also a step in the right direction for the series. Of course, many fans of the series probably will not like the transition to first-person, but for me that isn't too much of a problem. For me, it's not the camera angle that makes a Resident Evil game good, but the horror elements and enemy designs, which RE7 delivers on.Here's a basic list of my experiencePros:+Shooting is made tense by the limited ammo combined with enemy movement patterns.+Baker family is full of personality, and make each cutscene fun to watch.+Exploring the Baker Mansion is a blast, and you never get the feeling that there's a useless or boring room.+Boss fights are very well-designed (with the exception of the final one). No two boss fights are the same.+Tons of graphical options, including some I've never even seen before. Whether you play the game on a toaster or a quantum computer, you should be able to find the settings that are right for you.+Tons of inspiration from horror movies, especially Evil Dead+DLC is actually well-designed, and pretty fun+Decent new game+ rewards for completing certain tasksCons:-Tons of unskippable events where nothing really happens. This isn't much of a problem for the first playthrough, but when you're going through your 3rd or 4th run they will eat up almost half of your game time. These are especially bad in the Guest House area.-As mentioned earlier, the final boss sucked, and barely even qualifies as a boss.-Not much enemy variety. Excluding the Baker family, there's only 3 types of enemies (4 if you include the normal molded with bigger claws)-Some of the DLC should have just been part of the base game. Minigames are basically standard in the Resident Evil series, so it's kind of unfair that they didn't include at least one in the base game.-No unlockable costumes, which has been a staple in the series (to be fair, this doesn't matter as much in first-person, but it would have been nice)Neutrals (either good or bad depending on the player):=Game is short, but doesn't have any filler. Some people may prefer longer games, even if it means more filler.=Like many other games in the series, this starts off as a horror game with limited resources and weak weapons, and ends as an action game with tons of weapons (including a grenade launcher)=The game isn't very connected to previous games in the series. You don't need to have played the previous games in order to understand the story in this one (though there are a few references newcomers will miss).One final note: If your favorite game in the series is either 4, 5, 6, or the Revelations games, you may be disappointed. Unlike those games, this game does not focus that much on combat. There is no ammo or currency dropped when you kill an enemy. The inventory is much more restricted. And you are much more vulnerable in this game.If you loved the classic Resident Evils, and you don't mind the change to first-person (which Capcom had been experimenting with since Resident Evil Survivor), you'll probably like this game.If you have never played Resident Evil, but you love horror games, you'll probably like this.8/10;1;74,7;24/07/2017;206;5;;8.0

36;Action; 99,90;Quick SummaryDevil May Cry 5 (DMC5) is an excellent game that has a very in-depth combat and skills, along with a high skill ceiling. It also sports gorgeous visuals thanks to the RE engine, and various characters that all play differently and keep the whole thing feeling fresh. Environments are varied with hidden secrets, challenges, and alternative routes. The cutscenes are just as high quality as the gameplay itself, with a variety of interesting characters and interesting twists. ProsFantastic graphics and visualsGreat optimizationAn absolute banger of a soundtrack, that fits the game perfectlyHuge variety of enemies and bossesVery in-depth combat system with tons of skills and weapons to unlock and upgradeInteresting story with unique and memorable charactersHighly replay-ableCons One character is very simplistic to play  For new comers, the skills and different characters can be overwhelming Some of the combat arenas become predictable Any key skips a cutscene with no warning (including tab + shift for steam overlay)  Camera angle with keyboard and mouse is often jankyStory*No Spoilers* DMC5 has a pretty interesting story that most players will appreciate after having played the previous games. However, for newcomers, it’s still fairly easy to follow as the game has a fairly lengthy introductory cutscene, along with gradual tutorials that also give you lore at the same time. All of the characters are well developed and playing as different ones at varying times in the story adds a lot to the experience as well. Having plenty of cutscenes was a nice change of pace from all the murder and mayhem, as fun as that was. Overall, the story in DMC is very well done and ties into the old games, but is still accessible to newcomers (though players would benefit from watching a synopsis at least).  GameplayThis is where the meat of this game is. And also, where you will take a lot of meat out of demons (because hey, they deserve it). The gameplay in DMC5 is smooth, brutal, and requires fast reflexes. It feels like riding a roller coaster that you’re not wearing a seat belt on… increasingly exciting and invigorating, but if you lose control and thus your groove, you will be punished. One additional note is that the game seems to encourage multiple playthroughs, since you cannot unlock everything the first time through and you unlock additional modes or further upgrades upon your first campaign completion. The gameplay can roughly be divided into a few categories, though with some overlap: Combat, Skills, Items, and Exploration.The combatThe combat in DMC5 is essentially third person hack and slash with lots of different combos or skills you can utilize. A very important fact to keep in mind is that combat varies greatly between characters as well, so you can expect a large amount of variety. The battles primarily take place inside a locked arena (similar to Doom 2016) which means there is truly no escape, and you must fight to the death. There are a few roaming enemies throughout the course of the game but most of the battles are very focused, intentional events. Correctly making combo moves and switching up attack styles quickly results in a higher score in your missions, with the highest being “SSS”. Most combat consists of a primary attack using some sort of melee weapon (like a sword or fists), with a secondary attack that is often ranged (like a revolver or shotgun). Another important element is the “lock-on” feature that lets you concentrate on a specific enemy, and which also acts as a modifier for certain attacks. In addition, enemy attacks can often be countered or dodged with the correct time and combination of keys.  SkillsBranching out from these basic attacks, are skills and movements you can unlock that all can be affected by different keys or buttons. A single primary attack can be totally different by simply using your forward action or reverse action, or holding lock on with a movement key. The upgrade system really goes insanely in-depth here, providing the player the opportunity to really experiment and find the skills they enjoy. Skills are unlocked with red orbs which are essentially in-game currency, that is dropped from kills and can also be found scattered throughout the maps. As the game progresses, a lot of new and different ultimate skills can be unlocked, that push the combat ability to the max. Depending on the character, some truly devastating powers can be unleashed that knock all but the most powerful demons into bits. These ultimate powers however take time to charge and can be replenished in various but limited ways. ItemsDMC5 also allows item utilization to aid players in beating it. For instance, there are certain orbs you can pick up that restore your health, or permanently upgrade it. One orb will revive you on the spot if you die in a battle. This does however reduce your score level in the mission. There are various weapons and items you can select from before you start a mission, essentially customizing your loadout.ExplorationFinally, exploration actually plays a pretty significant part in DMC5. For all the vicious combat and lively action, there is a surprising amount of hidden secrets that reveal extra missions or items. Also, there are a few small environmental puzzles that you need to figure out to progress, but they are nothing complicated. Often times, exploration will really help with future battles since you can find important upgrades or even replenish health before a boss.Graphics and VisualsGraphics and optimization are where DMC5 really shines. The character faces and animations are impeccable, and the environments are detailed with fantastic atmosphere. The combat is only made better because of this, as there is nothing quite like seeing high resolution demon blood flying across the screen! SoundDMC5 has very well-designed audio, with lots of audio cues and combat that provides plenty of feedback. The only audio-related aspect that really stood out in a good way, was the soundtrack. DMC5 frankly has an amazing soundtrack, with really memorable tracks that fit perfectly to the high intensity combat. Another cool detail is the music intensity increases with the score the player racks up during combat. I still find myself playing the songs after completing the game and headbanging along with them.Bugs, Glitches and CrashesI did experience one bug with the game. After using Steam overlay, a couple times the game wouldn’t fully recognize my input and so I couldn’t move or switch weapons. I had to reload a checkpoint to get around this. Another technical complaint I have is that the cutscenes will skip with the press of any key, so keep your fingers off the keyboard if you want to watch the cutscenes. However, you CAN re-watch cutscenes from the main menu. Price… is it worth it?DMC5 is currently listed at $59.99, which is typical for a newer AAA game. For true fans of the DMC franchise, this price is easily worth it because of how re-playable the game is and a decently long campaign. For newcomers such as myself, I got the game on the most recent sale for $19 which was definitely a bargain for the high-quality experience.ConclusionIn conclusion, DMC5 seems to be a nearly flawless addition to the DMC franchise with lots of fluid and technical combat, an intense story, and absolutely gorgeous visuals. For someone completely new to the franchise and even to the genre, it is worth picking up on sale and obliterating some demons.

37;Action; 99,90;"I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. What more could you want?";1;1237,8;13/06/2020;756;18;;10.0
37;Action; 99,90;Most enjoyable grind everI’m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers. ProsGood graphicsA lot of contentVery challengingA lot of monsters to huntNo p2w crapNice coopConsPerformance could be slightly betterWhile there are a lot of monsters, many of them feel too similar to each otherMy curator page;1;106,9;6/06/2019;550;20;;8.0
37;Action; 99,90;Edit: Just an update on this review. After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.Previous Review:This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game.;1;388,0;23/03/2021;1281;11;;10.0

37;Action; 99,90;I'm in my mid 40's so I don't always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter: World has me hooked. Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun.;1;103,6;21/08/2019;538;13;;10.0
37;Action; 99,90;Now that this game has gotten a resurgence, here's a PSA.There's something called the Defender's Set in the beginning of the game. Now MH does nothing to explain it but it is basically endgame quality gear blueprint given to everyone in the forge from the beginning of the game. It's basically a means for players to speedrun their way through the game to reach Iceborne, the expansion. Literally speedrunning because the weapons do so much damage that it negates every reason to interact with basically every mechanic in the game. Monster weaknesses, equipment types, literally any reason to pop open the hunter guide, look at what a monster is weak to, where its weakness is, and what elements might help. All of this is useless with the Defender Set. Farming materials to make the next tier of gear, progressively getting stronger and basically interacting with the ladder of equipment or crafting as a whole is negated as well.If you want to play Monster Hunter with all its features, don't use the Defender Set. Because in the end the game is about the journey, not the destination. Learning how to be a monster hunter, and how to hunt well for your class is exceptionally fun in this game.But by all means if you want to breeze through this game, blowing past the entire base game just to reach the expansion where you'll most definitely get your ass kicked because you don't know the mechanics of the game, go ahead. In the end you're either learning the game in the beginning, or learning the game in the end. Benefits of learning the game in the beginning is that you have more content. Negatives of learning the game later is that you just wasted the base game away for no reason.;1;30,7;31/12/2023;743;12;;5.0
37;Action; 99,90;"If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!";1;867,8;9/11/2018;780;25;;8.0
37;Action; 99,90;Pretty fun, both solo and multi, don't believe the mixed reviews those were all due to the bad launch, the game is a very solid edition to the franchise and as its own game.

Gear only helps you up until a certain point, skill will still win the day.;1;3332,0;14/06/2019;348;13;;9.0
38;Action; 84,00;All the frustration of a freemium game economy, whilst still having to pay a traditional game's up front costs. I got this game on sale, and still honestly feel ripped off. With the base version of the game, the majority of the the content is hidden behind a pay wall. Including most importantly the characters, I would be fine if it was just cosmetics, but over half the cast is inaccessible (don't even get me started on the stages, music, cosmetics etc). Was genuinely shocked to discover that Capcom's reaction to people's frustration with how slow in game currency was earnt at release, was to cut income even further! now the only way to get fight money (the in game currency), is through levelling up, or from online matches. The online matches give you 50 fight money for a win, for context to unlock a character is 100,000......yeah (new stages are 70,000, costumes are 40,000). That should tell you everything about the game's economy you need to know. The sad thing is the game itself is pretty good, what little you get to play of it anyway. I have loved street fighter since I first played SF2 in the arcades.But what capcom did with SF5 has really soured my view of any future involvement with the series. This is all obviously done in a cynical attempt to squeeze more money out of their costumers (who again have already paid for the base game), but i'm not spending another penny on this game, this anti consumer BS needs to end.;0;603,6;3/12/2018;1426;16;;1.0

38;Action; 84,00;After many hours, a great number of ranked matches and late night lobbies, and a couple local tournaments, I can finally say confidently that I do not recommend this game.The singleplayer content is barebones and not at all worth playing. This is fine in a competitive fighting game, since the focus is more on competitive multiplayer. If you're not interested in that, take a hard pass on Street Fighter V and play a fighting game with worthwhile singleplayer content. Guilty Gear Xrd is a good one.Mechanically, the game isn't bad at all. It's fairly simple, with a modest amount of easy to understand mechanics that lead to interesting gameplay. It's also popular, so you can always find people online to play with. It's not a difficult game to pick up, and it's more accessible and rewarding than most other fighting games. That said, I still have a few problems with the gameplay.Namely:* Defensive options are awful. This is why high level play is just watching people do meaty setups on eachother. It's also why throw loops are as prevalent as they are.* Questionable design decisions, such as removing frame 1 invuln from all meterless DPs. This really skews the risk/reward of those moves, which is an odd choice from a game franchise that's so rooted in pure and simple fighting game fundamentals.* Timing is sort of strange. It's a game with 3 frame normals, so things like blockstrings and meaty attacks need to be pretty airtight. If they're not (and it's hard for them to be with any sort of network stutter in the mix) then mashing light buttons will get you out of a lot of situations. This should be a bad habit, but it's rewarding in this game for some reason.* The input delay/netcode makes it feel pretty unresponsive. If you're coming from other fighting games, expect to get hit by many fullscreen moves (Balrog's rush punches, Cammy's EX spiral arrow, Ken's EX tatsu) if you don't block preemptively.In terms of everything aside from the gameplay, it's an inexcusable travesty. The netcode is terrible, and even on wired connections with people in my own hometown it feels jerky and frustrating. Other fighting games add input delay, or seem to run the game in slow motion. SFV just teleports you from one connected attack to the next so you can watch yourself die in a jerky mess of unreactable attacks. The netcode also seems to send all the lag to the person with better internet. I remember having a really good night on ranked with seemingly stable connections and slow witted opponents, only to later realize I had been torrenting and my sister had been watching Netflix, presumably sending all the lag to my opponents.Unlocking characters, costumes, colors, and stages requires either making microtransactions with real world money, or spending ingame currency, which is extremely limited and for the most part non-renewable. You get 50 fight money for a win in a ranked match, zero for a loss. Characters cost 100,000 fight money each. You do the math. All the good cosmetics in this game are behind paywalls that you'd expect to see in free to play games. But it's a full price triple-A title, and the character season passes are also inexcusably expensive.Capcom has been pretty terrible with supporting this game as well. Patches are frequently delayed by weeks if not months, and it's missing many quality of life changes that should have been included at time of release (eg. saving battle lounge settings when the game closes, or being able to skip the awful tutorial on a fresh install). They also straight up lied about a Linux release. That was supposed to happen concurrent with the Windows release, but there has been no word from Capcom on that front.I could go on. There's been a very long train of disappointments with this game, and you shouldn't hop on it. Maybe they'll release Super Street Fighter V as the rumors say, and then I'll give this review another revision, but I don't see things changing for the better. The game is still going to be expensive, laggy, and unsatisfying. But it's got a lot of players, so it's got that going for it.Crossplay is very nice though.

39;Action; 99,90;"(Played through on Superhero Mode)Without wasting any time, if you are a Mega Man fan, you probably already have the game. If you haven't played Mega Man before, or aren't certain if you will enjoy it, the selectable difficulty modes really open up the game to first-timers so you can continuously retry without running out of chances, so don't fret.(Length)The stages are heavily based on the NES styled titles, with large rooms and unique gimmicks. There are 8 Main Stages, 2 Wily Stages, a simple Boss Capsule Refight Stage, and a short ride to the Final Battle. There is no intro stage in this game, which is a minor disappointment. The total amount of content is brisk, so if you know what you are doing, expect to complete the game in a few hours, tops.The extra modes pad out the content a little, but the entire point of this game is to challenge yourself. You can get a lot of replay value out of trying to play the game without using special weapons or the gear system, essentially replaying the same content with restrictions to unlock achievements or self improvement.(Balance)There are only two areas I can recall where you get trapped into taking a hit, one in Blastman's stage, and one in Impact Man's. Unless you have foresight, you will likely take a hit there. Thankfully, there is no such forced hit involving instant death. All falling blocks and spikes are clearly telegraphed, and any player skillful enough can feasibly avoid such obstacles without unfair deaths.E-Tank Spam trivializes a lot of the difficulty on all modes, but especially the easier ones, due to the sheer amount of bolts that drop. E-Tanks only cost 100 bolts a pop, and you can walk out of a stage with 1000+ if you pick up every drop. You simply never run out of these things, which means most of the game can be beaten by standing on top of bosses and tanking the damage while you burn the bosses down, chugging E-Tanks every so often. This is only a problem if you choose to use this form of recovery, though.Everything felt great playing Buster Only, so if you are interested in a playthrough without powers or special weapons, look forward to an excellent challenge.(Weapons)The special weapons in this game are easily among the most powerful in a long line of games. They have very generous hitboxes and have enormous utility, making almost all of them a pure upgrade over your default buster. Power Gear toggling just to wipe the screen with overwhelming special weapons feels extremely nice.In addition, there is a new option to change your special weapons with the right control stick. It has never been easier to utilize these things.(Soundtrack)Although music is a very subjective thing, I have to say that I found the vast majority of the soundtrack to be utterly forgettable. This is very much a soundtrack made for a newer age, and felt much more modernized than ever before. You won't find the same level of catchy melodies as any of the past Mega Man titles. None of the music is outright bad, but it pains you much moreso when the series is known for such well made music and you end the experience without any of the tunes stuck in your head.(Final Notes)The game is short and sweet. There are really just 10 meaty stages with a few extra short walks to the final bosses. You will get your money's worth if you decide to try the higher difficulties or want to play the side modes, but they are more of the same. If you enjoy challenging yourself, grab this for sure. If you are more of a ""variety"" gamer and will only play this once, you might only get 3-5 hours out of it, so do keep that in mind.If you want to see this series prosper, you really owe it to yourself to support the Blue Bomber so that his games may continue. The sales are essentially votes, so vote with your wallet! Welcome back, buddy. MIssed ya.";1;33,6;2/10/2018;77;1;;7.0

39;Action; 99,90;A lot better than i expected it to be.There's really only two complaints i have with this game:The music isn't as spectacular as everyone hoped.  Mega Man games have routinely had top notch exceptional music soundtracks, every song being an instant classic.  In this one however the music is very forgettable and almost unnoticeable in comparison.  That being said there is many music conversion packs people have created and will create to rectify this problem (The most recent one i tried was the 8-bit version)..The only other complaint i have is minor, in that it's hard to tell where Mega Man's hit box is so jumping in tight areas like Torch Man stage gets a little frustrating, but you can get use to that.Also, there's really only 2 full Wily stages (not including Wily and the re-fights), but all the robot master levels are longer than normal so it kind of makes up for it.  Still a bit of a disappointment when you get there, but it's not a huge deal.  One more Wily level probably would have done the trick.Overall, very nicely done.  Might be controversial, but I might even consider it to be in the top 5 if not top 3 best classic Mega Man games (classic meaning 1-11 not including the X or Zero series, which i have actually not played yet).------------------------------Control Scheme I Used:Gamepad defaults with D-Pad for movement.  May have rebound auto fire button.------------------------------Worth the current price (CDN$ 39.99)?  This might be a hard sell, even fans of Mega Man.What I actually paid: $31.99------------------------------Completionist Review:DLC Achievements:  NoneRating:  There's a fair bit of workCan be completed in one run:  No, there's challenges and things outside the main game.Chapter Select: Kind of, you can pick the level order, and which challenges to start.Did I need/use a guide?  No.Lots of things to get here for achievements, including a speedrun, which took a couple attempts.  Overall lots of fun though really, and the challenges are different and interesting for the most part.;1;63,8;22/11/2018;38;1;;7.0
39;Action; 99,90;Summary: They got it right!Mega Man 11 is a revival of the 30 (or 31 if you're from Japan) year old series, and it seriously seems like they listened to fan input along the way. Mega Man regains all of his core moves: running and jumping, but also sliding and charge shot. In addition, if you wish to use the gears, you absolutely can. They enhance your speed and your weapons, but overall they make the game easier. You can actually beat the full game buster only, and that's one of the areas in which they were clearly listening to the fans.The controls are tight as ever, though bear in mind that using a wireless controller or analog stick will not effectively replicate the feel of the classic series in its prime. Thankfully, there is generic gamepad support, even though it uses Xbox button icons to represent said gamepad's buttons and can get confusing. Want to play on an SNES controller? No problem -- I finished the game doing so! You'll need a couple more buttons to use everything, however.Of note, Mega Man's jump distance has been increased by around 25%, likely to facilitate the switch to widescreen. Aside from that, however, it'll feel more like playing Mega Man 4 or 5 than any other title.The graphics are beautiful, though the perspectives used in cutscenes are a bit limited. Obviously core gameplay should lock it as is done, but cutscenes don't need to be beholden to these limitations. The audio is catchy as ever, though default settings really drown out its wonderful soundtrack. I'd recommend adjusting the voices and SFX down a bit before beginning.If you're worried about replayability, challenges have you covered. The developers made good use of the fairly short roster of maps to design some clever, if not incredibly evil challenges. Getting gold on them will keep you busy for quite some time.A few people have mentioned slowdown issues similar to those experienced in the Legacy Collections. Luckily, I didn't experience this, in spite of having slowdown in LC2 and XLC1. It seems to be fairly rare.That aside, with the difficulty vets expect and the easier difficulty settings making it accessible to newcomers, this is a fantastic run-and-gun for anyone.(also, I will throw my money at any Bass DLC Capcom shoves at me);1;24,7;3/10/2018;51;2;;8.0

39;Action; 99,90;Mega Man 11Rock em, sock emReviewAfter an eight year absence, I am happy to report that Mega Man 11 succeeds, but there are a few caveats. Let's be honest: it wouldn't take much for Mega Man 11 to not succeed in the eyes of the fans when you are springboarding off 2003's lacklustre, dead-in-it's tracks Mega Man X7 (which tried to transition the series into 3D with disastrous results), which only ended up taking the franchise to new levels of low that nearly saw the blue bomber tumble into notoriety with fans himself. The follow-up, Mega Man X8, didn't do much to elevate the franchise out of the muck within which it had found itself, with X8 never rising above mediocre. Many of us fans thought Mega Man was on his way to the retirement village to be sunsetted by Capcom after the throwback Mega Man 10 was released in 2010 feeling like a cash-in. The years long radio silence after that only further made it seem like Capcom had no clear path forward for the blue bomber and  fans started to wonder whether the franchise was finally on life support.I will admit, as a huge fan of the late eighties originals of which Mega Man 2 is the high point, the return announcement in 2017 did catch me off guard. With creator Keiji Inafune now having moved on from Capcom, how could Capcom ever do without Inafune guiding the series back to life? Although we would soon all learn that Inafune's best days were probably behind him too after Mighty No. 9 failed to emerge successfully from under the shackles of the Mega Man franchise, ending up an inferior product in almost every conceivable way from from mascot, to robot bosses, to world, and finally extended to the villain. The next question was with Inafune gone, could Capcom ever make the blue bomber relevant again?Sadly, no as it seems like the days of Mega Man's relevance have long passed and are now assigned to history for keeping. When we first met him in 1987, platformers were the rock star's of gaming. They sold systems by virtue of the mascot alone  Now you would be lucky to find a big publisher willing to fund one outside of Nintendo. While the genre did have a bit of a resurgence in the early noughties when they went 3D and became gobbledegook collectathons, its mostly fallen to indie studios to keep the genre alive and quite frankly they have been doing a sterling job. Just look at some of the crazy and wonderful things with the genre they have been doing (Super Meat Boy and Celeste are classic examples of this). In many ways it kind of feels like the game succeeds by virtue of simply existing, especially for us fans starved of his presence but Capcom does a fairly good job of taking the series and modernising some of its mechanics but that is where it stops because the rest of the formula remains untouched from the original game - a blueprint that has been subsequently adhered to rigidly throughout the long running series. This legacy design that the series keeps on insisting including is now starting to feel more than a little archaic, ensuring there are very little to no surprises with each new release. It's at the point now where its become the franchises Achilles heel. You won't find any platforming moments of brilliance here, like the kinds of stuff on display in Celeste or Hollow Knight. It plays it very safe and is clearly made for long standing fans of the series, as if Capcom knew it was treading on thin ice with them.If you were never much of a fan of the series, then Mega Man 11 is going to do little, if anything, to turn that around. Another thing I must mention is that it is also insanely hard, and that is probably going to drive a lot of people away. I had to drop it from normal difficulty (which is advised for mainstays of the series which I consider myself) to easy mode and I still struggled like mad to make headway with it. The first three Mega Man games are considered to be amongst the hardest games ever created, yet I could clear Mega Man 1/2 and Mega Man 3 in a single sitting back in the day while typing text messages to my dentist and doing tax calculations for my tax return. Yet here I couldn't even get through a single level of repeated trying in the five or so hours I banged my head against the normal difficulty before resigning myself to the fact that I must now officially be an old fart who has to play on baby settings.As a fan I appreciate that Capcom has brought Mega Man back from the dead and I appreciate the graphical update to modern HD graphics. Mega Man has never looked more clearer although I would love to see the series return back to its pixel roots, BUT when I say pixel, I am speaking along the lines of the gorgeous indie platform Kings and Queens of our current era (Celeste, Blasphemous or even better yet Children of Morta which has these incredibly highly detailed pixel counts that look utterly gorgeous) and not the 8-bit revival of Mega Man 10. The reality here is that Mega Man 11 is not the return to form sequel many would have you believe. It's enjoyable but it's also not enjoyable to play in equal measure and is not one of his better adventures. I also found the eight Dr. Wily robots you need to defeat a little underwhelming from a mechanics and design standpoint. If Capcom is to continue Mega Man's adventures into the future, then I certainly hope they look into the history of the most celebrated and beloved platformers of our modern era that have all, almost exclusively, sprung from the indie scene because that is where Mega Man's true innovation and salvation lies. There is no point in trying to revive his best days. Let history keep record of those.One word or phrase to sum up the experienceFor the fansPerformance/Bug related incidentsNone, should run easily on most hardware as the game is not demanding on CPU or GPU.Similar to gamesMega Man 2, Celeste, Might No. 9Rating ★★★★★★★☆☆☆https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869453510;1;25,6;7/04/2021;44;1;;5.0

40;Action; 99,00;"INTRODUCTIONLet me start off by saying this game is unfinished, a large chunk of the game is missing that contains the originally planned ending and the entire second half of the game is filled with the same exact missions from the first half but with increased difficulty. That's a lot to take at once, now you might ask yourself, what makes it worth buying?Well, even in this state, the game is a lot of fun to play, having probably THE BEST stealth open world gameplay ever made, you can approach missions in any way you want, either stealth or guns blazing, either call a helicopter for support or snipe from afar, either send your companion in or go in a vehicle or tank, anything is possible in terms of gameplay. STORY The main story isn't the greatest ever made, especially if you judge it as an MGS game but it has some preety cool high points made incredible by the 80s soundtrack with tracks like ""The Man who Sold the World"" by David Bowie and others by great artists like the Oscar winning Ennio Morricone or Donna Burke.Don't come into this expecting long cutscenes like in MGS 4, the cutscenes are kept to a minimum, apart from a short intro to each mission you just get thrown into the game and you decide how you play. The characters are great and very well voice acted but there's a lack of character development, at least for the side characters.What I found dissapointing was the second half of the game, you can feel the production had to be stopped and missions had to be re-used after Kojima got layed off. This is a terrible decision on Konami's part but thankfully the overall feel of the game wasn't affected. The biggest thing that's missing is a true ending to the game, there's footage of the ending that we were supposed to get on Youtube but instead we get an ok but not great ending, leaving lots of plot-holes and feel that the game isn't finished. SOUNDS/SOUNDTRACK The soundtrack is some of the best 80s songs you'll ever hear, it won the award for best soundtrack at TGS 2015 but sadly Konami (the publishers of the game) didn't allow the creator of the game, Hideo Kojima, the right to participate the award show and pick up the prize. If you love 80s music, you'll love the soundtrack for this game.A taste of the incredible soundtrack:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrkzIN2eP0UThe ambient sounds, even tho not the best, are used preety well to create the feel of a big open world and for the most part work preety well even tho there is certainly room for improvement. GAMEPLAY As said before, the gameplay is the best stealth open world gameplay ever created, allowing you complete freedom in the way you approach the given situation, the controls are sharp and responsive on both keyboard and mouse and controller. You have a huge variety of guns and customization options numbering in the hundreds as well as a number of companions like D-dog or Quiet who give you a tactical advantage in the field.The side missions are high in number but not that much in quality, some of them are really good and feature main characters and cutscenes while the most (around 80%) are repetitive side quests like ""Destroy X number of tanks"" or ""Take out the 2 guards at that location"". GRAPHICS & OPTIMISATION The graphics look good, especially the lightning and reflections look preety realistic, altho you might find some textures lacking since this game also came out on the previous generation of consoles, as well as the foliage not looking that great and lacking Ambient Occlusion.The optimisation is  INCREDIBLE . Yea, I had to write that in caps. You can run this on litteraly anything, even a potato plugged to any screen could produce playable framerates. As long as your graphics card supports DX11 (any card from 2010 and later) you will run this game. ONLINE The online mode is ok, not great. It suffers from lots of connection issues, lag and of course, microtransactions (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Konami). This is definitely not the main part of the game and you'll mainly be spending your time in the singleplayer. LENGTH It took me roughly 55 hrs to finish the game, doing mainly the story missions with quite a few side quests. I had the overall game completion around 60%. I have no doubt that if you want to reach perfect score for all the missions and complete every single side quest on the map you'll put at least 100 hours into this game. CONCLUSION A good final chapter to this series, even tho dissapointing in some aspects, MGS 5 manages to stay fun through it's incredible gameplay and have preety high replay value. The game is unfinished, the story isn't complete, we're missing the true ending that was supposed to be made, but with the current price it's still a very enjoyable experience.GRAPHICS: 9/10SOUND: 8/10SOUNDTRACK: 10/10GAMEPLAY: 10/10STORY: 6/10ONLINE: 5/10OVERALL: 8/10";1;56,3;26/05/2016;198;11;;8.0
41;Sports;00,00;"Comprehensive Comparison of PES and FIFALet me start by saying, that I have been a religious FIFA player since FIFA 09. FIFA has been my #1 most played game by far over the last decade. I, like many others, have grown tired of EA's continued b***s***, and this year I decided to actually do something about it, and give PES a chance. This is my very first PES title, and actually my first ever non-FIFA soccer title.That being said, I am going to try to compare my experience so far in PES to FIFA, in as many detailed categories as possible, grading each game and explaining which title excels at what, in my personal opinion.1. Graphics Winner?    PES...but barelyLet's not kid ourselves, no one is complaining about FIFA's graphics. That being said, if you take the time to get the data packages, PES's graphics are such a breath of fresh air, from the same graphics in FIFA's previous 3 or 4 titles. Celebrations, animations, and fine details are all on point. I very rarely find something out of place on screen, that takes away from the realism of the game like I do when playing FIFA. The movement of players feels realistic, compared to the feeling of players being on skates with FIFA. The only department that I could say needs work in PES, is obviously better stadiums, and stadium ambiance (backgrounds, fans,ect.) 2. Audio & Commentary Winner?   FIFA... by a landslideI will start by saying that I do enjoy the songs that are on PES's soundtrack. That is the last good thing I will say about PES's audio. The very first match, I found the audio quality of the commentary team (Peter Drury and Jim Beglin)to be refreshing. By the second match, I had already heard one phrase three separate times. They make no remark if a ball goes off the post, will tell a random side story in the middle of a counterattack, and repeat the same phrases towards the end of nearly every match. It is tiresome. I am not advocating for FIFA's commentary, by any means. But it is marginally better than PES's, for now. FIFA's soundtrack also takes the cake here, being four times the size (104 to PES's measly 25) and also being, well just better. Looks like FIFA can keep the crown of best video game soundtrack, for now. 3. Career ModeWinner?   PES...but barelyCareer mode is the main reason I play FIFA or soccer games in general. I do enjoy online play, but most of my play time comes from Career mode. So you bet, the first thing I did after finishing the data packages, was to start a career with Fulham to get to the Prem. OH BOY am I having so much fun with it. Managing finances is fun, I enjoy the way training, and skill training is done. I enjoy being able to play as Diego Maradona or Johan Cruyff. I especially enjoy the stat tracking, and the ability to take part in Europa league (assuming you have the data packs). The biggest thing for me, is that I've yet to experience a single bug. As we all know, FIFA's career mode is still bug-ridden, and has been for years with little change.4. Ultimate Team/My TeamWinner?   PES...but barelyThis one was difficult for me. And at the end of the day, PES gets the edge for me, soley for being only less pay-to-win than FIFA is. There are several changes to PES's version of UT. There are several good ideas littered in, such as the way PES does chemistry (known as Team Spirit). It focuses on positions, play-styles, your managers tactics, and player's ability to match these tactics, instead of coming from nationalities or leagues played in. The scout and agent system results in a much fairer allocation of decent players (I have spent 10$, and played roughly 10 matches of ranked online, and I have packed Ronaldo, several other 85+ players, a classic Ronaldinho, ect. It is not nearly as gamble based as FIFA is, if you put in a few dollars into the game, and spend your coins the right way, you can eventually get a decent team, guaranteed. It is however, more difficult to find specific players, however this matters less with the change in chemistry systems. My biggest complaint with PES's Ultimate team, is that it feels, I don't know, incomplete? Maybe I am spoiled with FIFA's squad building challenges, tournaments, and events. But other than playing ranked online matches, there seems to be a lack of actual things to do in PES's My Team. I'm still going to give it the edge, however because it does not feel scripted, and hasn't been completely ruined by micro-transactions. Yet. 5. Online playWinner?   FIFA...but barelyI wanted to give this to PES. FIFA has become so scripted lately that it legitimately isn't fun playing online. And I would probably give this to PES. If, that is, people actually played it. I struggle finding matches at all hours of the day. The only consistent mode I've been able to get a match, is on My Team's ranked mode. Lag isn't really an issue, but having to wait so long for a match is always a pain, no matter what game you are playing. Sadly this seems like a paradox, but until FIFA players migrate to this game, FIFA will still be the go-to for playing an online match.6. Overall Gameplay & Football RealismWinner?   PES...by a landslideThis is the category I've been waiting for. This category is the reason I cannot put PES down. It just feels so, right? Gone are the days of skating through opponents like they're ghosts. Gone are the days of being able to wack a pefectly scripted belter in to the upper 90, when your opponents back is to goal from outside the box. Tactics are actually tactics. The players actually do what you want them to. The best way I can describe this, is that in FIFA, you control 1 player at a time, and the ai controls the other 10 on your team. In PES, your tactics control the other 10 players you don't control. They hold their line where you tell them. They press if you want to press. They park the bus if you tell them to park the bus. Fouls feel real, like real, coliding bodies. My ONLY complaint with PES's realism, is that I think I have yet to see a single injury, for either side, in every game I've played. Otherwise, It is such a nice breath of fresh air to EA's ""arcade soccer"" as I'm now calling it. This will be enough to keep me off of FIFA 20 for the remainder of this year, I think. FINAL VERDICT:     PES...but barelyDisclaimer: I am really mad at EA. I'm tired of what they as developers have done to so many good franchises. Unfortunately, they are here to stay. So the best we as a fanbase can do, is show them that we won't put up with everything. Me purchasing PES this season, instead of FIFA, is my way of telling them that. I understand the game, and change, will not be welcome by everyone. But if you, like me, are tired of FIFA giving you the same game every single year, I promise that this year's PES will be a nice change that will keep you entertained if you keep an open mind.Don't forget the data package!";1;324,2;7/10/2019;260;17;;8.0
41;Sports;00,00;"_Review only about offline mode_Ok, so here's the thing, I've played FIFA from 2014 to 2019, I used to absolutely love it, to the point where I had more than 800h of play time on fifa 16, and I only play Career Mode! But over the years, I've spent less and less hours on it because I couldn't have fun with it anymore. And that's the key for me, having fun. And I lost that, I stopped playing football games for a year before I decided to try PES 2020.I love the gameplay on PES 2020, it's fun, challenging, and it feels realistic, plus I was always a fan of build up play rather than one man dribbling the entire defence, so seems like PES is a perfect match for me. Now of course, PES and FIFA aren't perfect games, far from it, both have their strength and weaknesses.I know the lack of licensing can be annoying, but there are solutions for that on PC, and it's worth the effort, especially since it isn't a particularly hard thing to do. The UI isn't as pretty as FIFA, players aren't as responsive sometimes, and referees are... weird. But again, it's fun! I've felt the love for football again playing this game, something I haven't felt in years! And when I score a screamer in this game, I actually get up my chair and celebrate with the players.So, if you're like me, and miss the joy of playing football, you might want to give PES a try.PS: Don't be that ""PES/FIFA is trash"" guy, keep your mind open to trying new things. Like I said, they aren't perfect game, and it's about weighing the pros and the cons, for you personnally.

41;Sports;00,00;I can't understand how a game company can downgrade the gameplay each year.I tought 2019 was bad, than here comes this atrocity. 2 words describe this game, inconsistent garbage. I can't believe that the day came when i actually think that fifa's gameplay is better.Defending AI is horrendous, at certain points in the game players would just stop from tackling,  take a suddenly turn away, or just casually walk by in the opposite direction. The passing is inconsistent and insane at the same time, passing stats don't matter in the key moments. Messi or Ronaldinho will miss simple short passes without pressure, while Cuadrado and Hettich (white starting player) will hit insane through passes. Another annoying thing is when you press the passing button or shooting button, long before the ball arrives to you and then the genious ai will make a turtle slow dribble and then shoot. The dribbling is garbage, i can't understand how Messi and R10 feel like 100 kg, 40 yrs old men when changing direction. Shooting is random, Suarez or Messi will miss alone with the keeper in one game, in the another Cuadrado will score a hat trick. The more i think about the gameplay the more i get annoyed. Let's continue. The players act insane while tired in the 0-20% bar. I haven't seen in my life a pro player just quit walking to a pass in a game, even if it was the 112'th min. I understand cramps, slowness, but just stopping and looking at the ball? What is this?Another thing is the matchmaking ... noob keyboard player, with a 3030 team, 470 rating, I continuously get insta matched with 680+ players with 3800+ teams in the pvp events. I'd rather stay in que a little while and get matched with  someone that is at my current skill level, than getting owned by 100 Ronaldo's . The last thing that i want to talk about is the crashes, In 30 hours of gameplay i had my game crushing 3 times only in pvp games. It's annoying, but it could be a microsoft/driver problem i'm not sure. In the conclusion, for the first time in a very long time since i discovered pes, and quit fifa, i am this mad about the gameplay. The scripting and the inconstancy is at an all time high. I can't even talk about the good things because of it, I'm sorry. The only reason i find playing this game, it's because is free;0;1715,1;19/12/2019;181;22;;1.0
41;Sports;00,00;I am a long-time fan of the series, been playing since Winning Eleven for PS1, and this could have been a masterpiece. But if I could use one word to describe this game is LAZY.Konami makes hundreds of millions of dollars with this game and it amuses me that they just do not seem to care about their fans and players. Go ahead and read the reviews, the same complaints over and over which Konami simply ignores. This is a huge disrespect to the people who made them who they are today. My main issues with the game are:1. AI is virtually non-existant. They seem to have taken shortcuts instead of doing a competent job at programming the game. The players' abilities do not seem to matter, it is almost as if there is a gameplay baseline which is moved up or down depending on opponent's strenght, difficulty level and whether match is home or away. Your players move slower, make more mistakes, ignore the ball, etc. while your opponents all of a sudden become flawless aliens who just score with ease, no matter what you do. Making your players worse and opponent better instead of improving AI quality is just LAZY and DISRESPECTFUL.2. Master League has no immersion at all. All championships feel the same and it just feels like we are playing and endless stream of individual games. Forget about the amazing feeling of hiring a good player and how he would change your game, and that drive to win and get better ones. It is now just boring and repetitive.3. The lag and unresponsiveness. Remember back when we pressed right and the player moved right? Forget it, now the players receive the ball, think about their tax returns, then maybe start to move towards... nevermind they already lost the ball and are still performing the movement animation. Playing online is incredibly annoying due to the constant lag - I have a 300mb internet connection with very low ping, yet I have to press the buttons 2 seconds before I expect them to take action.4. Physical contact is everything. Nothing else matters, this is now a wrestling game. There is no more dribbling, feints, awesome through balls, nothing, just have a strong player and win the ball or get ahead regardless of pace and acceleration.5. Become a Legend. If you hate maths and need to study for a maths test, play three BAL matches. It will crush your soul in such a way that 12h studying algebra will feel like a walk in the park with a cute and nice girl. Your team's AI is so bad that is almost funny, but you cannot laugh because the anger turned your heart into lava and your soul into a dark and cold abyss of misery and pain. DO NOT PLAY BAL if you like anything about your life.6. MyClub is not as bad as some comments suggest. It is pay-to-win only for kids with desire for immediate reward. I have not spent a dime on in-game purchases and have been managing to build a decent team. Enjoy the ride you know? However, it is also clearly a cash grab and the lag makes it impossible to enjoy playing.This game is decent only for playing for fun with mates, but if you already own a previous version this one is not worth it. Not yet. If Konami decides to use some of their millions in profits to improve AI and responsiveness and gameplay overall, then it might become a good purchase.If you want to have fun, do not buy this game. If you are searching for something to make you really annoyed then go ahead and purchase it.;0;246,4;5/11/2019;161;39;;2.0
41;Sports;00,00;TL.DR buy this only if it's sold for $5I don't play PVP. I only play PVE in campaign modes on Top Player difficulty (I believe has been the most balanced difficulty even since the older PES). Here's my review:PROSx- Crowd reactions are cool (atmospheric, vibes etc.)x- Animation- fantastic (with exception to cutscenes, will explain why in CONS)x- Innovative dribbling/defending control schemes and mechanics- a major improvement from 2019 CONSe- Cutscenes- massive downgrade from previous versions.They made it so that every player is the same height e.g. Messi is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with VVD in ref cutscenes. I understand it's so that it's easier to animate the interaction between the players (skips clipping/hoverhands) but honestly I prefer the clipping and hoverhands than making Cristiano stand as tall as Hazard. It's super awkward to look at.e- Defending/dribbling is ridiculously stacked against you (vs. COM).If you dribble with Suarez (who not only has good technique, but is strong enough to maintain balance while shielding away many defenders), even the flimsy Coutinho can simply stick his leg in, make you trip, and take the ball from you (nothing from the ref).If you press with VVD and bump with your shoulder, even the skin-and-bones Sterling can hold you off as he dribbles from the middle line all the way to the penalty box and take a shot.The Physical Contact, player height and weight stat are essentially useless.e- Refball.You can be dispossessed by obstruction, pushing, pulling etc. and the ref will pretend he doesn't see it, but it goes the other way when you dispossess the same way. The ref will always blow foul.Also some very outrageous tackles that gets my player a 2-month injury gets no booking.e- Flawed contact-ragdolling system.Sometimes the animation follows through which causes some players to trip, stumble and fall, and the ref will foul you for this (never the COM, just you), when it clearly has nothing to do with the ball or possession or even anything cynical.Also you can abuse the contact system by placing your player in the way of a running COM player. If he's running to chase the counter-attack, you will slow him down. He will keep the same path despite your obstruction instead of avoiding you. It looks ridiculous.e- VIRTUALLY ALL THE COM FREEKICKS GO IN. ALL OF THEM. EVERYONE IS JUNINHO WHEN THEY TAKE FREEKICKS.Even Juninho misses IRL from time to time.e- Scripted player movement.Whether or not that pass will connect is determined by:1. The passing stat for direct passes.2. The passing stat, and pace stat of the recipient for through passes.This is logical up until you visibly see that that player should have been able to receive the pass but suddenly slows down because by measure of stats, he shouldn't have been able to. It's a stupid way of implementing stats logic. This has been the case for PES for many years back-to-back. The same stupid implementation goes for defending. A player who should've been able to intercept suddenly slows down and allows a goal to be conceded.;0;121,2;7/06/2020;165;9;;2.0
41;Sports;00,00;Latest patch completely killed the game. Player first touch is brokenPlayer responsiveness is even worsePlayers stop mid run for no reason. Example, attackers on counter attack just abruptly stop or don't push forward at allFinishing seems inconsistentIs it me or did player face quality reduce dramatically??Defenders making awful decision and in general lack awareness and responsiveness even when ball is within their reachThe game is just infuriating and feels like I have no control over playersBlatant scripting is present in games;0;43,7;14/03/2020;101;7;;2.0
41;Sports;00,00;the offline experience may be decent, although stale and the same stuff over and over again... yes, they've added something like 10 different cutscenes to the master league (wich you're gonna skip anyway), and that's pretty much all the new stuff there is to it. wooooo!yes, the gameplay seems great at first, until you see your players running away from a loose ball, keepers concedeing goals that should be easy to stop, 96 rated defenders missing easy balls, 99 pace 99 acceleration players getting outpaced by piqué and so on... oh and refrees are a joke. Worse than last year if possible. FIX THIS KONAMI!then comes the online. what a mess... the matchmaking system is completely random, I'm around rank 700 and i get constantly matched with poor 300ish guys AND 1k monsters. Lag cheaters are still there since idk pes 2016? How hard is it, KONAMI, to detect them, ban them, OR maybe change your stupid system so that if they mess with the connection (and mine is still running fine, which is the case) they loose the game and move on? Why on earth should I waste 20 minutes of my day just to see the game cancelled at 90'+3?!?You still face players who when loosing just leave the joypad for the rest of the match, and that can mean 15-20 minutes of pointless gameplay. I mean, KONAMI, is it that difficult to implement a timer and kick inactive players like almost EVERY other online game does?GP prizes for wins and tournaments are a joke compared to the cost of contract renewals and packs, which are useless anyway if you decided to buy a few Myclub Coins, since almost EVERY special player is WAY better than any other, so you'll end up finding useless players that will become trainers... for 25k GP?!? seriously? oh and limiting purchases of special players to 3 at a time, and letting you get duplicates is soooo frustrating!what else... MUSIC is HORRIBLE and repetitive as usual (got a tank full of gas yeah you know really fast gimme everything you got gimme everything you got...). REALLY?!?MENUS are the same stuff as last year, they've just redone the main menu, the rest is still the same unresponsive mess. going from one menu to the other takes forever, there are loading times every two seconds, plus you can barely tell which menu entry is selected (dark purple vs black: genius choice KONAMI!!)OH, and you CANNOT reset your block list... so if you're, like me, blocking cheaters and AFKers etc... you'll have your list capped pretty soon. Then one day you'll tell yourself, let's reset, maybe those cheaters quit playing and i can block more active ones... well you can't! You have to unblock every player one after the other, and everytime there's a loading time, a confirmation box... RIDICULOUS.I could go on and on forever with the flaws of this game, but i think this is enough. Hope KONAMI gets their stuff together really fast, cause this game is an insult to the player base.Put the money into development, bug fixing, network optimization, idk, SOMETHING, instead of useless partnerships... it makes no sense when 75% of the teams and players are unlicensed anyway and you'll NEED to get an option file to get a decent experience... Let FIFA worry about that and get back to the drawing board to deliver solid gameplay, solid online experience and a 2020 interface AT LEAST.Until then, i won't be buying this joke anymoreOh and how hard could that be to implement a way of quitting the game other than goin back to the main menu?!? why do you force us to Alt+F4?!?;0;380,4;29/01/2020;60;1;;0.0
41;Sports;00,00;So what can i say. Ive been playing fifa for years. Ive played every fifa game that has ever been released.I have player hundreds of hours of fifa 17, fifa 18 and fifa 19.The frustration level with fifa kept on going up until i could not stand it anymore.I have played pes before (2013, 2014 and 2015) and then i played myclub in pes2019. It was soooooo much better. The gameplay is soooo much better that fifa.myClub is so much more rewarding the fut. It does not even come close.So if you want to be able to play soccer the way you want (not the way the scripts want you to), then play pes.

43;Action; 49,99;As someone who has never played the old Castlevania games I went blind to Lords of Shadow. I didn’t knew anything about the story other than that it involved vampires. The only thing that made me buy the game in the first place was the huge amount of positive reviews. And, like I usually do, I waited until I got the other two Castlevania games on Steam to start playing the first one. A few hours into the game, I was having a blast.From top notch music to gorgeous and memorable locations such as forests, gothic castles, desert lands and ruins from an old civilization, this game has it all. Combined witha fast paced action combat (with tons of unlockable combos) this made for quite the epic experience. Although enemy variety was somewhat lacking, certain locaitons had a specific set of enemies assigned to it, thus making it harder to forget those zones. As for the gameplay itself, as I mentioned before, it is quite fast paced. You have to adapt to changes in the enemy behavior, aswell as bosses, and use a variety of attacks to effectively defeat your foes. The game itself is rather long, taking around 20-22 hours to play it through, which was rather a surprise for me. Of course, for all the completionists and collectible hunters out there, Lords of Shadow also has something in store for you. The game is divided in 12 chapters (+2 chapters corresponding to the DLC included in the Ultimate Edition), and each of those chapters is subsequently divided into several stages. It is in these stages that you’ll be able to explore and collect scrolls containing letters from fallen brethren of the Brootherhood of Light, and you’ll also be able to find gems that enhance your abilities. And if you’re into bigger challenges, you can try completing Trials for said stages which, I believe, reward you with an achievement. So yeah, not only the game is a blast on its foundations, but it also rewards exploration, which, in my book, is always a plus.Now, enough talking about all the good things this game has, and lets talk about my only gripe with the game, the controls, or perhaps my terrible skills at precision platforming in a 3D game. I swear that sometimes the game just made me want to shove the controller through my monitor (anger issues perhaps?). Very rare were these situations, but they were infuriating when they occurred. I honestly can’t tell you if it was an issue with the controls, like the inability to control with precisio where you want to land or if I’m just really bad at jumping from platform to platform in a 3D game.That said, I can’t recommend this game enough. It is an epic journey through some amazing landscapes and it has one of the most insane and thrilling soundtracks I’ve ever heard on a videogame. Please, do yourself a favour and do not keep Lords of Shadow on your backlog.I hope these words accomplish my intended goal, which was raising awareness for a series that I feel that went under the radar for alot of PC gamers. Or perhaps that is just me, afterall, I have never played the old Castlevania games and I only played this one three years after its release, maybe that’s why.PS: Sorry for the wall of text.;1;22,0;23/02/2016;176;14;;8.0
43;Action; 49,99;I must say I never played a Castlevania game before, so forgive me when I lack some background for a proper comparison to the previous installments. Overall this game is fairly good. It has some problems like the strange hitboxes which seem a bit off sometimes (you can get hit even though the enemy's attack actually didn't reach you and things like these), but this happens rarely. The other negative point is the static camera which sometimes positions not very idealy, preventing you from viewing parts of the screen and sometimes missing hidden areas. In terms of art direction this game is gorgeous. Mercury Steam really had some talent working on the world design of this game. If you like gothic european fantasy art styles, this game delivered in my opinion. Art direction is stunning at times and I even stopped for a few seconds here and there to eyeball the scenery. It's a very pretty looking game.The voice acting is also of decent quality. Story might not be god tier like, but it's still remains interesting with a few surprising plot twists in the second half of the game.What needs to be said is: The game takes a lot of time to get really started. The first levels are basically tutorials where you gain new equipment and movesets. It gets more interesting after the 3rd or 4th chapter.The combat is a bit comparable to God of War's. Your weapon is a whip-like chain that lets you perform direct attacks to center on single enemies or areal attacks for groups of enemies. You can mix these attacks and also learn new movesets and combos the more experience points you gather. These combos and attacks can be combined with the light and shadow powers you receive throughout the game. That way you pile up a nice plethora of combos and movesets at your disposal which gives the combat system enough depth to not get boring. Not Devil May Cry-tier but still nice.In short: Do you love european medieval gothic art styles and are looking for an action game with nice visuals and somewhat meaty combat system? Try it. Also try the demo first. Just know that the demo only represents the very beginning of the game and is not really a good indictation of how fleshed out the game gets.;1;63,0;25/11/2013;286;0;;8.0

43;Action; 49,99;”A storm is coming. Mankind faces ruin and despair. The world is changing, yet hope remains in the hearts of the people.”Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game that is very similar to the early God of War games, just with a slightly different main weapon, the Combat Cross. a retractable chain whip that has many uses when handling enemies and level obstacles. I never played the old Castlevania games, so I won’t be doing any comparisons between them. Pros✔️ Good Story with interesting side characters.✔️ The combat is fun, with lots of abilities and combos to learn.✔️ Puzzles can be challenging.✔️ Great variety of enemies.✔️ Excellent boss fights.✔️ Replayablility (trials).✔️ Fun DLCs that have challenging puzzles and boss fights.✔️ The game is visually Impressive, with lots of areas to explore.✔️ Character models look excellent.✔️ The game is well-optimized✔️ Mostly great and memorable soundtrack.Cons❌ The protagonist is bland and generic.❌ Level Design needs some work.StoryYou control Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light, who found that his wife was murdered recently. Your goal is basically to destroy an ancient order, known as the Lords of Shadow, to bring her back to life and save the world from darkness. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2123469352Most of the characters in this game are interesting, mysterious and intriguing. On the other hand, Gabriel has very little personality. he is a generic protagonist with his cliche one-liners that you see in other games. It is until you play the DLCs where his character is more fleshed out.The game has a total of 12 chapters (including the DLC), which include over 40 levels. Each level in this game usually takes about 10-20 minutes to complete, so you will be seeing a lot of loading screens. However, the story and writing overall were good enough to keep me intrigued till the end.GameplayCombat: Your main weapon is the Combat Cross, a retractable chain whip that can hit enemies from a great distance (very similar to the old God of War games and especially Darksiders 3). You will be earn new abilities and throwables while you progress that make the combat much more varied and engaging. You can also perform awesome finishing moves on enemies which vary from one enemy to another. QTEs and button mashing are also a common occurence. during kill animations, while solving puzzles, when operating a mechanism and sometimes during cutscenes. The QTEs were easy to execute and didn't bother me much.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2123469149You earn points from slaying enemies and solving puzzles, which you can spend on learning new combos and skills. You will also obtain two types of medallions later in the story. one of which inflicts more damage to enemies while the other replenishes your health by attacking them. You can check all combos and skills in the menu, as each one has its own simple animated video that shows what happens when you do it ingame. The only issue I have with the combat is that the block/parry button is also used for dodging, so you can accidentally dodge an enemy instead of parrying an attack.Enemies: You will face all kinds of enemies in the game, such as Vampires, Zombies, Lycans, Skeleton Warriors, Cave Trolls and so many more. You can learn more about them in your Bestiary (located in the menu). You can ride some of the large beasts, after inflicting a good amount of damage, and use them to kill the other enemies.Puzzles: There are a lot of puzzles in this game. Aside from killing enemies, the Combat Cross can also be used to solve different puzzles and act as a grappling hook to swing to unreachable areas, or during platforming sessions. The puzzles get harder and harder as you progress through the story, and some require you to find particular scrolls from dead knights (can also be accessed in the main menu) or mount a certain monster to solve them.Bosses: There are a lot of bosses in the game that range from lieutenant vampires to huge titans, and some will grant you new abilities, once you defeat them. I like the boss fights, they are engaging, creative and balanced, even on higher difficulty settings.Trials: You can replay the chapters again, after you complete them, but with special challenges. Each and every level in the game has its own Trial, which are difficult but add more replay value.Difficulty: I chose the Knight difficulty (hard) and it was perfect. the enemies and bosses are tougher and deal more damage but remain fair and balanced, as you will be using the abilities and combos that you learn to slay them and progress through the game.Graphics and Level DesignFor a 2010 game, the graphics look pretty good. From vast and detailed environments to good looking character models. There are ingame cutscenes and prerecorded ones, the Ingame cutscenes still hold up and characters have decent facial animation. You will be visiting different areas in this game, such as enchanted forests and the cold and chilly oblivion lake, and these areas provide a good sense of immersion. Areas range from the more generic, like the Dark Dungeon, to the absolutely beautiful, such as the Clockwork Tower.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2123469174Every so often you will come across a branching path, but the game fails to show you which way leads to the beaten path (long walks and similar looking paths), and if you missed it then there’s a chance you can’t go back and have to restart the level all over again. There are a lot of secrets and hidden areas that you can find and explore in the levels, so watch out for them.TechnicalThe game is well-optimized and ran beautifully. No issues to report.

The songs range from the epic orchestra of Hunting Path to the pleasant, heart-wrenching melody of Waterfalls of Agharta and Belmont’s Theme. DLCThere are two main DLCs in the game, Reverie and Resurrection, and they continue the story of the base game. I can’t say more than that to avoid spoilers, but they are 2 chapters and 1 hours long each and they were pretty fun. The first DLC is mainly puzzles and less fighting, and the second one is just two very challenging boss fights and that’s about it.Additional Details:Total playtime18.5 hours (with DLC) without playing the trialsRecommended difficultyKnight (Hard)M&K or ControllerBoth work but a controller is preferableOffline modeYesAchievementsYes, some are challengingTrading cardsNoneGames SavingAutomaticallyFinal ThoughtsWhen I first installed Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, I had low expectations and thought I would just delete it after an hour or two, but I actually had a lot of fun and enjoyed my time playing it.

43;Action; 49,99;The most brutal white knightI think this game is underrated. I played it without knowing anything about it and I loved it.You play as Gabriel who serves to protect people from evil forces. His wife dies and her soul end up being trapped in between worlds. She guides Gabriel so he could defeat the lords of shadow and bring peace to world and its people.The game starts with a really nice cut-scene and throws you in combat right after that which serves as tutorial. After getting used to controls you go on a journey to deal with the darkness. On your way you'll be slaying monsters like undead beings and solve some puzzles. Of course your wife is always with you and you get some nice cut-scenes once in while. It also has a really good, gloomy atmosphere.One of the things I loved the most is combat. It's brutal, fast but not too hard to learn although on harder difficulties you'll need to sweat  a lot i guess, i've on easiest like i do most of the time. You have various skills which unlock with time and some nice moves. The combat is similar to God of War.Then there are boss fights. Boss variety is great in this game. From smaller ones like werewolves or trolls to gigantic monsters, again similar to God of War. Speaking of variety, most bosses are very different and require a different approach each time so it never becomes boring. Boss design is great too, same as all the minor enemies.The puzzles on the other hand are not so fun. I'm not even sure an action game needs those. I loves those light, easy puzzles in Uncharted games but here they're a bit too much. Some may be quite challenging and you spend time figuring it out but instead you just want to brutally murder more monsters. I mean it's a matter of taste but I personally don't like when action games are disrupted by lengthy puzzles, I just want to kill things and bring light to the people. But overall you'll be fighting most of the time.The only bigger downside I could think of is that some areas are annoying. Not because they're hard but it just feels like it lasts forever and you just want to move on to something fresh.It's a wonderful game graphically. Obviously it doesn't look like current AAA games but when it came out it looked really good and in my opinion still looks good today, especially the cut-scenes.There's also a huge variety of environments and they're beautiful. Forests, castles, greenery, snow, you name it, everything looks really nice.I guess some people might not like the fixed camera. Well, maybe not fixed but you can't control it. I find it nice since it always puts you on the right perspective and zooms in or out when required. It works perfectly.Controls are responsive and you can execute all the moves without any bugs or clunkiness.Sound design is great too. Voice acting is up to AAA standards and characters sound believable. Sounds add to the atmosphere a lot, it might be calm chirping of birds one second and in a blink of an eye orchestral music starts playing and you stand up against a deadly foe.Overall one of the best action games i've played. If you enjoy third person action games, fast, fluid combat, good story and want to kill a titan it's for you.ProsFun combatGreat graphicsGreat sound designGreat variety in environmentsGreat boss varietyConsSome areas drag too longFollow my curator page for more;1;14,2;15/05/2021;61;0;;8.0

43;Action; 49,99;"[This is a no spoilers review]Oof, this game, I really have mixed feelings about it. It has some incredible visuals and the soundtrack is also pretty nice. The story is decent, but not particularly noteworthy - although the general lore is interesting, if you like arthurian legend and vampires.But in the end, everything in this game is a mix of ups and downs. It almost feels like they didn't really know how to make games, but tried their hands on it anyway, just to get a format for their ideas. So many rules are broken, design inconsistencies, introducing mechanics to people then suddenly they work differently ""just because."" It can be a really frustrating experience, and most of the game is absolutely riddled with invisible walls (every single level will have you go ""wait, I can't go there?""), plus the fact that you have no control over the camera. There's platforms and jumping puzzles all over the place, but all of it is completely on rails. For example: You can't jump out from a wall, if there's nothing to jump out to and grab. This is a sign of lazy design, where instead of working on adequately communicating when the users SHOULD jump, they just don't let them jump at all, if there's nothing to jump to. It might not sound like much, but it feels incredibly restrictive, with absolutely no illusion of freedom at all.You can find a lot of general inspirations in this game, but it's almost like it has no idea if what it wants to be. It's all brooding and dark, but then there's the occassional joke they crack up, completely out of context, leaving you feeling very awkward afterwards. Unfortunately, lacking narrative and mechanical identity, means that it never does anything but visuals and music properly. In here, you'll see strains of Devil May Cry mostly, with the occassional ""Shadow of the Colossus"" moments, which are often very poorly implemented, lengthy and frustrating.I usually play DMC with the difficulty all the way up, because it feels rewarding to progress, thanks to the fact that its rules of play are consistent. But for this game, I ended up turning down the difficulty. because Lords of Shadow is really hard, but in a very frustrating way, by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over its own rules from time to time. It takes all sense of user responsibility away, leaving you with no feeling of ""ouch that was my own fault, need to get better,"" but instead an ocean of ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!"" With ultimate edition especially, with the final boss in the extra chapters, they just end up going full ♥♥♥♥♥♥, by telling you to ""watch the moves of the boss to avoid its attacks,"" while simultaneously forcing you to jump into the air where you can't dodge. There's about a fraction of a second for you to react, but if you're in a wrong position, you can get screwed hard and even stun-locked until you're dead. Not a nice experience.On the upside, at least, it is a pretty long game. If you want to stroll around and take in the environmental design, you'll be pleased to see just how varied the landscapes are.For the 25 euro asking price, I can't recommend it. However, if you ever see it on sale and want a lengthy, decently interesting experience, you should probably give this game a look. Just don't expect a very polished experience.[Edit]: Oh yeah, just thought that I'd add the fact, that despite the really stupid moments this game has, the rest of it still made well enough up for it, for me to sit through nearly 20 hours and completing the story. It's not a terrible game, but it's not amazing either. It just has content from both ends of the spectrum.Oh and for god's sake Gabriel, there is such a thing as too many dramatic pauses when you speak!";1;19,8;15/11/2014;79;5;;3.0

44;Action; 79,00;I bought the Contra Anniversary Collection solely for the Famicom version of Contra. Many, many years ago when I was in elementary school, I would go to my neighbour/classmate’s house to play Nintendo after finishing my homework. It was he who introduced me to the Famicom version of Contra, and we beat it together. It was one of the first, if not the first, Nintendo games that I finished.To be able to play a Contra console game legally on the PC is a dream come true. For the purpose of game preservation, it’s nice to have classic Contra games available outside of the Nintendo platforms. Although you can play these games with a keyboard on the PC, it’s definitely not advisable. Contra games are designed to be – and should be – played using a game controller.As excited as I was for this collection of Contra games, I didn’t have a good first impression of it. It runs in windowed mode with no (clear) option to configure it to run in borderless fullscreen. it has a paltry selection of unappealing border frames. it features game selection screens that are cluttered and inelegant in design. Along with glaring typographical errors, the screens reminded me of PowerPoint slides made by an amateur.Although the Famicom (i.e., Japanese) version of Contra was included with the original lineup of English games, Japanese version of the other games were added later via an update. Japanese Contra (arcade), Super Contra (arcade and Super Famicom), Contra III, Operation C, and Contra: Hard Corps were simply relegated to a separate screen. A single game selection screen showcasing all versions of featured titles would have been preferable.Many of the games in the collection still hold up to this day. Famicom Contra is still as exciting as I remembered it to be. Super C is a solid sequel that delivers more intense side-scrolling run-and-gun action. Operation C may be a shorter and easier game in comparison, but still amazes me by how well it plays as a Game Boy title. It’s only the arcade games that I’m indifferent to, for I found them less snappy than their console counterparts, and their vertical screen orientation wasn’t very conducive to side-scrolling gameplay.As nostalgic as I was for Famicom Contra, I found Contra III and Contra: Hard Corps to be the standout titles of the collection. Contra III exudes the “extreme” vibe of the 1990s and showcases the SNES/Super Famicom’s Mode 7 rendering capabilities very well. Contra: Hard Corps surprised me with its branching narrative and high replayability. As a spin-off title, it doesn’t feel like a traditional Contra game, but it’s just as exciting to play.Sadly, online co-op is not available. Considering Digital Eclipse/Capcom managed to incorporate online gameplay for a few of its Street Fighter titles in the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection that was released a year earlier, I did wonder if Konami could have done the same with this anthology of games.Plus, while it may seem like there are many games to choose from, what you actually have in this collection are 5 titles: Contra, Super Contra, Operation C, Contra III: The Alien Wars and Contra: Hard Corps. The number of games is inflated to 16 by offering different regional versions of these titles. After completing Famicom Contra, I saw little point in playing the NES version. Similarly, I wasn’t all that interested in trying out the Japanese versions of other games. Unless you’re a really big fan of the Contra series (and/or an achievement hunter), it’s unlikely that you’ll play all variations of the same title. I guess you can say Contra Anniversary Collection is artificially bulked up.And for an anniversary collection, this anthology of games is disappointingly incomplete. Since Konami decided to include Contra: Hard Corp, which is a spin-off title of the mainline Contra games, what about the other games in the spin-off series? What about the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance versions of Contra III? Where is Contra 4 for the DS? What about the European version of Contra and Operation C, both of which are also confusingly called Probotector, just like the European version of Contra: Hard Corps?Contra Anniversary Collection is far from a great package of Contra games. Even with the included History of Contra in-game book, it feels incomplete, hastily put together, and disorganized. (I guess that’s kind of befitting since it seems as though Konami has no clear direction with the Contra series at the time of this review.) This anthology of games deserved better treatment. If you’re a fan of simply a title or two in this collection, it may be best to wait for it to go on sale. But, I do think this collection is worth checking even if it’s only for Contra III, Contra: Hard Corps, and of course, Famicom Contra.;1;13,3;15/08/2023;39;0;;2.0
44;Action; 79,00;Good Games! Questionable PackagingSo..you like Contra? Want to relive the good old days when Konami wasn't a meme? This is for you! A Problematic but fun slice of Nostalgia buundled in a an old gymbag that may or may not have been used to store roadkill. *sigh* Konami, why you gotta be so Konami?So in this collection you have pretty much all the Contra games up to the PSX era. Plus a few bonus games, sort of , They're just JP versions of some of the other games. Now we all know COntra, pretty much one of the codifiers of the side-scrolling, 'run & gun'  genre. ALl the games are true to their original releases so pretty much everything that was good about them originally is still here, and everything that was bugged, glitched, unfair, or bad about them is also here. So top marks and a gold star for the games...Said gold-star must be ripped away however for the poor packaging of those games. This collection is a console port. and a lazy one at that. The Options are somewhat limited but functional. I can't fathom why they would release a game like this and not include online multiplayer, I mean its like a no-brainer. It does support Remote Play together but it is rather poorly implemented to to the point that its honestly easier to use a 3rd party program to handle multiplayer. Couch Co-Op is nice, but come on! if they're gonna put this on PC they should have at least done some work to make it Online. I mean CAPCOM managed to do it, ATARI managed to do it, SNK managed to do it...Why oh why do you have to be so Konami Konami?And then we come to my personal peeve. The control configuration, or should I say, the lack thereof. Now if you're playing with a controller, this isn't so bad, but if you want to play via Keyboard...yeah KOnami thinks you're a freak and has done their darndest to make configuring the controls as painful as possible for you. For starters you will be limited to 6 keys. Q, W, A. S. Z, and X. These are the only keyboard buttons you can configure.You can change the action performed by those buttons but you can't use any other buttons, and even then the game itself does very little to tell you since it only ever shows the controller buttons in the configuration. Each of the controller buttons maps to different keyboard button directly and you'll need to do a bit of trial and error (or forum searching) to figure out what=what. If this sounds needlessly complicated and obtuse, you're right.Honestly, you're better off using a 3rd party app like AutoHotKey to deal with configuring if you're using keyboard. If you're using a controller.. its pretty much pick up and play, though for convenience you'll want to be using an X-Box style control because thats what the system assumes.On the plus side the extras and manual features are quite nice.So now for the breakdown:Pro(botector)s: All games are true to their original releases. The Graphical display settings are functional if limited. Good selection of games. 'Fair' challenge to be had.Con(tra)s: Lack of proper online multiplayer. Remote play together barely works. (Controller issues). Almost zero configuration for controls (especially for Keyboard Users).Konami: Shows off some of the past Konami's best games. Shows the 'lazy couldn't give a damn' we've come to expect from modern Konami.ConclusionHonestly, i was tempted to give this a thumbs down, for the keybinding and multiplayer issues but in the end the games won out. It's classic Contra and classic Konami. I'm willing to forgive a lot of crappy packaging for that. Though this one, this one toes the line. Can only hope they get a better developer to handle the ports.  And incase I need to say it a gain. A controller is strongly recommended if you're going to get this. So remember the holy mantra(UUDDLRLRBA) and try not to throw your controller through the monitor.;1;10,6;12/12/2020;50;9;;5.0

46;Action; 89,99;"Beautiful game not without its flaws. But even after 6 years since its release, the attention to detail and overall integrity of the gameplay experience remains unmatched by most.The level of detail that went into the alien AI is incredible. Though it's ""learning"" is not a full-scale machine learning algorithm, SEGA built a much lighter-weight system that behaves just as well. To the casual player, the xenomorph latches on to your strategies and ensures the player doesn't brute force a level the same way over and over, for an incredibly immersive survival experience.Notable flaws to mention for the casual player:- The humans never run out of ammo.- Nightmare mode, though a fun challenge, was not scaled perfectly. Lockers are useless, and revolvers do far too much damage compared to shotguns- The game acts weirder the more times you load a save (without restarting the game) leading to unusual behaviors. - The game likes to drop inputs, especially at lower framerates.- The nature of how the alien hunts makes the game considerably harder for the casual player. By this I mean: The longer you stay in one place, the more ""convinced"" the alien is you're in that vicinity. Thus, by hiding, the game becomes more difficult. This is contrary to what would make sense by ""playing it safe.""- Novice mode, on the other end of the spectrum as nightmare, is also scaled down unusually. The alien is easily exploited because of this.- The biggest immersion-killer is the hard-on the xenomorph has for the player and only the player. You'll see this best when playing the game.- The map is very large and detailed, but as such, a bit intimidating. By going locker to locker on your way to the objective, it becomes incredibly easy to become lost. Most players forget that the motion tracker can also be used to find your way.- I think there are about 6 or 7 unique player models for insignificant players. Perhaps I only notice this because I have played the entirety of the game nearly 25 times, but you may start to notice it more and more on a casual run.I mention these things, not to demonstrate that the game is bad, but as key things I believe would have helped me when playing the game casually the first few times.Overall, I'd give this game a solid 9/10, especially for the player that likes a good challenge.";1;954,5;14/04/2020;424;16;;9.0

46;Action; 89,99;If there’s one game this year that I absolutely must give my faithfulness award to, it’s probably Alien: Isolation. I’m honestly having trouble thinking of a team of developers who clearly love the source material of their game and want to pay it an honest respect *more* than the developers behind Isolation at Creative Assembly. So much so that absolutely nothing is misplaced, although a few things are mishandled. Everything in Isolation is almost perfectly sculpted and placed to the point where you never have your immersion broken or get taken out of the story, and it’s crystal clear that Creative Assembly wanted to paint Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger’s original vision in a way that did it honor. And they have.The largest parts of that immersion can be boiled down to three features: graphic design, audio, and mechanics. Graphically, the game is absolutely stunning. Isolation aims to recreate Scott’s original style in the first Alien of “low fi sci fi”, and does it with perfection. Analog computers and cameras and voice recorders and huge, bulky spacesuits with 80’s GUIs. Believe me when I say that this is by far and away the most accurate and stellar portrayal of Alien in any other medium ever made. Second, the sound design: also, absolutely fantastic. Isolation uses the original score from the movie combined with eerie, high-tone background music that’s contrasted against it, and creates a mix of something that both astounds and terribly unnerves you at the same time. And finally, the mechanics, which, while they are a bit simplistic, lend themselves to the scenery that much more. There’s a lot of button pushing and primordial hacking and lever pulling in Isolation, which does wear thin after a while considering the standard formula is “get to location X” while avoiding everything in your way, but fortunately, this is circumvented by Isolation’s greatest strength: it’s fear factor.It’s been said that the best horror games have you just as terrified when something isn’t happening as when something is happening. Silent Hill 2 understood this. Amnesia: TDD understood this. And I’m glad to say Isolation does as well. The sound of the Alien crawling in the vents above you is constant, as well as the subliminal noises and creaks and bangs that keep your skin crawling, making you never aware when the Alien will drop down. And when it is on the screen, it’s fantastic. Creative Assembly have designed Giger’s Alien (there’s only one in this game) with virtually no scripting and mostly organic AI, creating the effective illusion that this is a real, breathing predator that searches rooms and doubles back and reacts to sound. It’s genuinely terrifying when you’re hiding in a locker, barely a metre away from the beast, knowing that if it turns right, it might hear you breathing or your motion tracker beeping, rip off the locker door and end you. That being said, with a lack of scripting comes some annoying and downright frustrating moments.The Alien can sometimes spend three or four minutes searching the room you’re hiding in and leaving you no chance to get away before it leaves, and other times it may just drop out of a vent right in front of you and leave you no chance to escape. And given that Isolation’s style of hacking and even saving requires you to leave yourself vulnerable for a few seconds (which, to be fair, does add to the horror factor), the game can be very unfair with how quickly and without warning you can be killed. This is both the greatest strength and weakness of the game: *NOTHING* you do is not potentially dangerous in some way. Sprinting down a hallway, using a save point, hacking a door, building an item... everything opens you up to a horrible death, and while that is incredibly atmospheric and nerve-wracking, at least a few times during your playthrough, you'll probably face a very unfair end. And the horror factor does tend to drain in the second half, when you're given a reliable method of defense against the Alien that keeps it at bay, and there's always someone talking in your ear, in contrast to the first half, where you're almost entirely alone and you have only molotovs to slow the Alien down, which are hard to craft, minimal and difficult to aim. So I feel the game could have benefitted by giving us fewer methods to defend ourselves.All that said, Isolation’s core is a solid, terrifying experience of a tride and true survival horror. It flies its colours well, and executes its design almost perfectly. There are some issues with the story what with it being very, very long, and the fact that you seem to have won multiple times before the game yanks the rug out from underneath you and tells you there’s a few more hours to go could be seen as annoying by some (though for me, I felt the game is paced and spread out enough that it was negligible). However, I felt that even getting to a save point in this game was a minor victory, and it makes the terrifying moments shine as bright as a star. Isolation’s concept is fantastic, its execution solid and its atmosphere astounding. For any Alien fan, for any survival horror connoisseur, and for any curious gamer that has enough money to reupholster their computer chair, this is a must-buy.My Rating: 9/10;1;48,4;6/10/2014;1615;18;;10.0
46;Action; 89,99;“Game over man, game over!”The  Alien  franchise has, unfortunately, not had many games recapturing the feeling of the original Alien movie. Alien: Isolation attempts to change that by going the route of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, by  not  giving you pulse rifles or smart guns, and making the Xenomorph  not  die from small-arms fire. In other words, in this game your best friend is silence and the nearest table or locker. If this sounds like your kind of horror survival game, read on. Campaign The events of the game take place fifteen years after the events of the first Alien movie, and you play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, the protagonist from the aforementioned movie. Amanda is working as an engineer in the sector where the Nostromo – the ship her mother was traveling with – went missing, and when approached by a Weyland-Yutani employee – Samuels – who informs her that its flight recorder has been found, she quickly accepts his offer to come along and recover it.This takes you to Sevastopol, the space station housing the only trace Amanda has of her mother, and where she will play a deadly cat and mouse game with the same terrors that tormented her mother. Gameplay | Graphics | Sound Alien: Isolation is a stealth game that revolves around your ability to calmly assess the situation and take the best course of action to deal with the problem at hand in a manner that won't catch the attention of the Xenomorph. If you go into this game with a twitchy trigger finger and hopes of bumrushing it to the end, you're gonna have a bad time. Most of your time in the game will be spent hiding in lockers and under tables, clutching your motion tracker close and hoping that the Xenomorph didn't hear or see you. A Xenomorph that, by the way, has no set paths or routes, instead going wherever it pleases, whenever it pleases, but usually drawn in by noises, which only adds to the terror this creature will instill in you. The game includes a crafting system which allows you to craft items to distract your enemies with, but it is in no way required. Over-reliance on your distraction tools can even be disadvantageous. And if you want to battle your friends in who can score the highest, there's Survivor Mode. This pits you against the Xenomorph in a small area from which you need to escape, and you'll earn points depending on how many optional objectives you completed and the time you took to escape, which then get uploaded to the Leaderboards. The Xenomorph is extremely aggressive in this mode, and you too need to be more daring and aggressive to counter the timer.Visually, the game is absolutely gorgeous, and you owe it to yourself to play it on the highest settings. From beads of sweat on the foreheads of survivors to the best looking fire effects I have seen to date, it is truly a feast for the eyes. The sounds are phenomenal across the board, and you really  should   need   a good sound system for this game, certainly with surround capabilities, and preferably headphones. Listening for the Xenomorph is far more reliable – and terrifying – than your motion tracker.   Flaws The unpredictability of the Xenomorph can in certain areas mean you get stuck in lockers for long periods of time, especially on higher difficulty levels. You eventually learn to outmaneuver it, but before you do that it can feel like a Locker Simulator. Another flaw, if you want to call it that, is that while the environments are beautifully crafted you won't have much time to appreciate them due to the omnipresent Xenomorph and other enemies.  In conclusion Alien Isolation  recaptures the feeling of the originial Alien movie exceptionally well, complete with the entire station interior looking like that found on the Nostromo, from the doors to beds to the computers. The feeling of isolation and vulnerability are ever-present and you will be tip-toeing through the levels and duck under the nearest table when you hear the signature noises from the ventilation shafts. If you've never known terror in a video game, this game will change that.Rated 9/10 - This is what a survival horror should be like.;1;19,0;21/06/2015;321;21;;10.0

46;Action; 89,99;In my 60 years of life and 347 viewings of the Alien movies collectively,owning every Aliens game released for PC,(the ones not in my Steam library are on disk)I have in my over 30 years of gaming rarely had as much fun playing a Stealth\Action game....period!Very well done,true to the films in almost every way.Genuinely thrilled that the devs worked that hard on the backstory and the characters.Subtle reminders from the films are all over the game if a little difficult to come upon.I absolutely and overwhelmingly recommend this to ANY Stealth\Horror\Action fan or Aliens nut.I am also Autistic which means (for me) I remember a LOT of details from the movies.The dialog,look of the Nostromo,gags,weapons,etc.If you need a Braingasm here's your fix.Edit Dec 2015,After waiting a year and a new sound card I wanted to update.My second playthrough didn't take as long but the experience is still beyond compare for this genre of game.The sound design is absolutely the BEST I have ever experienced in a game.It COULD be that I am just a rabid fan of the series but......nah.Playing on the higher difficulties will challenge all but the most coordinated of us....of which I 'aint   .)

It's really great (and ♥♥♥**** scary!) Prepare your speakers or headphones, crank your volume up and play this gem during the night. Is Alien: Isolation for everyone? Hmm... Perhaps not. If you require asurence, telegraphed threats, predictable solutions, and an inherent, hand-holding sense of ""fairness"", you might find the experience too much to handle, but those of you brave enough, who are craving a real test of your skills, instincts and nerves, will find a bounty of thrilling, engrossing, and profoundly fulfilling rewards. If you truly embrace it, Alien: Isolation will, during its most powerful moments, make you feel more alive than a video game has in years. Pros:The Alien is truly terrifying - The Perfect OrganismAmazing recreation of the Alien universe (it's like you are in the movie)Smart and unpredictable AI (one of the best ever)Looks astonishing on ultra settingsIf you play on Hard - you are the man (only for brave ones)Collecting all achievements is relatively hard, but totally rewardingCons:Some minor bugs on higher levelsHuman AI is somewhat stupidThe Alien is going to hunt you in your dreamsOverall:One of the best survival horrors I have played in years.

46;Action; 89,99;It was always going to be difficult to make a game worthy of the original Alien movie but Creative Assemby rose to the task and created an absolute classic. Not only was the game filled with tension and terror, it was filled with so much nostalgia that you almost felt like you were back watching the original movie at times. The graphics are great, although the aliasing is an issue due to the AA options not being great. The sound fits perfectly from the creepy ambient noises to the epic music. And the design of everything in the game was a true nod to the original movie. Everything looked like it had been dreamt up by someone in the 70s trying to predict what the future would look like and for old fans like me, it worked perfectly, even down to the addition of a slight film grain (which could be turned off).The game itself was terrifying, with the alien AI being brutally good at stalking you, and although there are a few places it feels too scripted, the general feeling you get is one of facing a supremely good predator who is learning your movements just as much as you are trying to learn his.The game could probably have been a little shorter and still been great, but in general I recommend this game without hesitation to any horror game fans, or any old timers who remember the original Alien movie with fondness (or terror).Here is my full video review, but be warned, it contains some spoilers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyxtFoG0bU;1;30,7;1/01/2015;240;8;;8.0
46;Action; 89,99;How To Play This Game1. Know what to expect. The trailers for this game suggested to me that you would be stuck on a ship with the alien and have to play smart and stealthily and it'd be around 8 hours long. I do not like to spoil myself by reading reviews and previews so I didn't know that most of this game is spent on an enormous space-station and I took 25 hours to beat this game. It's not built like an indie survival-horror title like I thought it would be, but instead like a triple-A title, for better and for worse. I would have liked a more well-paced game with a satisfying intro, climax, and conclusion, and not the drawn-out marathon we got instead, but that said, this game can be enjoyed as long as you know that and adjust accordingly.2. Soak in the game's atmosphere. Read everything, look at everything, and loot everything you can. The sound and music work is astounding and adds to the tension and fear rather than takes away from it like in Resident Evil 4. In RE4, whenever an enemy or enemies spawned somewhere in the vicinity, the same music would play until it or they all died. Thus, when there was no music playing, you knew you were safe. However, in A:I, the same effect kind of happens, but the Alien can pop up at any time with no warning, and only then the music will slowly ramp up and get louder the closer it gets to you. The same philosophy from RE4 is kind of there but it is far more subtle and dynamic. Great job Creative Assembly.3. Take your time. One of the reasons why IGN and Gamespot found this game frustrating is because reviewers only have a limited time-window in which they can complete and review a game.Your goal while playing this game should not be to 'beat it' but to enjoy it. If the game is frustrating you, stop playing it, and come back to it later. You will try new ways to get past an area, and be more level-headed. 'Professional' reviewers don't necessarily have this luxury because they're on a time-crunch. give them some slack.If you make 'beating' the game your goal, you will not enjoy it because it's very long for the type of game it is, and the game keeps pulling the carrot-on-a-stick further back each time you think you can bite it.4. Temper your expectations. Although this game looks very realistic and as believable as future space can be, it's still a videogame. The AI is still handled in a traditional way with set paths, with the twist of randomization thrown in. The Alien won't exactly behave like the Alien in the movie(s). It may throw you off and break you out of your immersive bubble when you see the Alien patrolling on its hind legs like a human, and run around desks when it should be jumping on top of the desk and coming straight for you. Just realize that is hard to program and give the developers some slack.5. Don't be too conservative when crafting. The game is fairly generous with crafting materials. Save before you go to a difficult area, try a different strategy, and if it doesn't work, reload your save and try something else. Be patient, and have fun coming up with new strategies.As a summation, enjoy the game, soak it all in, take your time, and embrace the challenge. This game was designed to be challenging, even on Easy. Instead of getting frustrated, open your mind, think differently, and use the tools the developers have given you to achieve your goal.Thank you for reading, and have a great day.;1;31,8;28/10/2014;216;3;;8.0

47;Simulation;00,00;This is the fastest I'm dropping an FM game, and by a MILE. 29 hours might not seem like much but for someone who has thousands and thousands of hours combined between previous editions going back to Championship Manager 4, it was enough.The game looked so promising, giving you control over more things than ever, with some little, sometimes unnecessary, but cool touches... in the end it delivers on most promises bar one, the crucial aspect - the match engine. That one doesn't seem like you can control it AT ALL.Most people have already talked about how there's just a lot of insane balls played over the top from your defenders, or the conversion rate of 1-on-1's, and it's all true.I have never felt less control over the matches in a Football Manager than in 2020. And it's not even close to the 2nd worst one.I guess many things worked flawlessly, and for that the team can take full credit. You've lured me in. Even with limited time I've decided to come back to the franchise after two years, so kudos to the marketing team.  The general feel of the UI is quite good. Opting for a lot of visual elements in some screens (training, responsibilities) instead of keeping it simple got messy, but it's not a big deal.Basically the vast majority of the game is fine, except for... the game itself. The match engine just doesn't cut it, and while I don't believe that's the case, it literally feels like it was an afterthought this year. To the extent that I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me this engine was created from scratch in like 100 hours.The match engine doesn't feel like you can affect the outcome, your team does the same things for the most part regardless of the instructions... The game gave me no joy, even when winning. I wasn't winning. My team wasn't playing the way I wanted. The majority of goals scored had nothing to do with the style of play my tactics were using.It felt like spending half an hour to polish a coin before a coin toss, thinking it would affect the outcome.I'm genuinely sad writing this review because I've always loved the franchise and I had high hopes. Perhaps too high and unjustified, but even at FM's worst points the game didn't disappoint me to such an extent.;0;29,7;1/01/2020;348;6;;2.0
47;Simulation;00,00;TLDR: 7.8/10 - WORTH buying, but NOT a MUST BUY.___*UPDATE (20/11/19 125hrs played)* So finished my 5th season with United, I've basically won every trophy this season, however I did get incredibly lucky in the UCL Semis where I beat City on Aggregate 1-0 (with a total of 3shots over 2 games) woops. Did some major changes to my squad, SOLD Pogba, Martial, Maguire, Fred and Costa, to fund my BUYS J Felix, Haaland, Marquinhos, Aouar, R Neves and Donnarumma. Massive changes to structure, but hope things go well in my 6th season. (After this season, i'm starting a fresh save)Despite my steam hours being limited, trust me, I've collected more than 1,500hrs in each FM that comes out each year(from fm10-19) (Yea probably need a life).Pros:+ Development Centre (very interesting)+ Tactics depth increased+ Board expectation and happiness depth increase+ SLIGHTLY improved AI and sims.+ Staff information slight change, but gives a nice feel+ Better interactions and fluidity in managing the team+ ***Expect the same as you've always gotten (more or less)Cons:- No game changing updates- Nothing ground breaking- Match Engine still far from 'Perfect'- 3D Rendering of your face is still crap- PES has ruined Juventus (but just wait for the usual Workshop fixes)- ***Expect the same as you've always gotten (more or less)I mean, I buy the game in support of the developers for all the years and hours of fun it's given me. So i've already grown to know what to expect as each year goes by. Its the same game, its just refreshed, squads updated, and some small nice additions. The development center seems to be a very nice addition to the game, however i'm not deep enough into the game to warrant a full conclusion on how it really performs. This year they've done a decent job in sorting the game out, nothing ground breaking, nothing overzealous, just simple and what you need. Look, this year its again a simple facelift plus some. The addition of a handful of small new features, and the big addition of the development center, its good. Thats it. Expect the game to be as how it always has been.However I believe there is an issue with one-on-ones at the moment, seem to miss too many or hit them directly at the keeper. Maybe its just my poor forwards, no clue, have to keep monitoring.POST-BETA Changes, are really minute, match engine tweaks have been a LITTLE BIT better, but still far from perfect. Still dislike the 1-on-1 failures and shooting from impossible acute angles. But its better than the start of BETA.Verdict:7.8/10 Its good as always, but nothing that jumps at you as a MUST BUY series. Good game as always nonetheless.Thanks if you managed to read this far.;1;470,0;2/11/2019;214;3;;8.0

47;Simulation;00,00;"Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. The match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. Wingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. Half the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.It's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are ""under review"", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.Edit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017.

Although still far from perfect, the 3D engine and graphics were improved, small tweaks through out the entire game and interface, more tactical response from the players in the pitch, improved relationships and the biggest focus for this new edition: The youth prospects and the future of your club and carreer. Now the club's objectives are set on a more accurate and demanding way and the young players are really taken into consideration regarding the next few years. It's fair to, somehow, say that this new edition is ""more of the same"", but in the end it's refreshing and its changes are enough to renew our desire and hunger to keep playing year after year this amazing game. I play since the very first edition back in the 90's, every year I spend long hours playing. I was a teenager by that time and I'm a 41 years old married father today.

47;Simulation;00,00;"This game (and the games before it) converted me into a football fan, and I had barely any appreciation of sports before that point.Football Manager is, in gaming terms, like a grand strategy RPG. You have the grand strategy element of heaps and heaps of numbers going up and down and the initial confusion of understanding what any of them mean, as well as being able to play for 400 hours (like I have) and realise you understand absolutely nothing about the game, and still having that creeping feeling that you really don't know what you're doing.The RPG element comes from your players. Each of your players has their own wants and needs, and you have to balance your match day squad as best as possible. It's not just a case of ""who's best at what"" (although sometimes it can be) - you might need to settle a disgruntled player, or give one of your younger players a chance to shine and get some experience in the first team.It's hard to show what the appeal of the FM series is unless you really sink your teeth into it. I can honestly say I get ridiculously immersed in this game. You experience the highs and lows of your labour, cringing when your team has an awful defeat and cheering when they do well. Were you responsible? Was it just RNG? Who knows, but it's fun, isn't it? Trying to work out what's actually you and what is just smoke and mirrors is part of the fun.What I'm trying to say is, even if you're not a fan of football and sport, if you have an interest in grand strategy or complex RPGs you may just appreciate the incredibly diverse and immersive game that has the potential to grab you here. For me, players like Alessandro Rossi, Hendrick Weydandt and Luismi are burned into my brain, and I've gotten a brand new appreciation for the complexity and nuance that the sport of football has.

Thanks for understanding.So, I like to say that as i have beaten the main game with all characters including Mighty and Ray i think i have the right to write a review based on Sonic Mania. Upon starting up the game i didn't know what i was getting into expect for knowing that Green Hill and Chemical Plant Zone were going to be in the game knowing that they are memorable video game levels. But after beating the game five times. Every stage i played were all memorable and all had fun gimmicks to accompany them. A personal favorite of mine that isn't Green Hill or Chemical Plant was HydroCity zone which made me go ""jolly they made a water level fun!"" So, our playable line of characters are:Sonic- Everyone favorite Sega Mascot who basically plays the same in the other games but with this game they have the ability to do a dropdash which i didn't use much to be fairly honest.Tails- The two tailed fox who has the ability to fly which is basically the easy mode of the game if i want to be honest and are just a reskin of Sonic but they can flyKnuckles- A echidna who can glide and climb on walls who is the hard mode of the game given that he also has a reduce jump height other thing to know is that parts of the level is unique to Knuckles which adds something new to the tableMighty- A armadillo that can do a ground pound which plays the same as sonicRay- A flying squirrel that can glide but with enough downforce can go back up to gain height as a way to flyThe Level Design: The level design of Sonic Mania is something that i enjoy for the most part since levels are meant to be replay to find new routes and find all the hidden special stages that are hidden in each zone. During my five different playthroughs i always found new routes that i never found back in my first playthrough thanks to what the character brought to the table or just pure curiosity that came across my mind.The Music:The music is something that i enjoyed to the fact that its hard to choose a personal favorite. I love the new remixes of old tracks like Green Hill Zone Act 2 and Chemical Plant Zone Act 2 which I should also mention that I enjoy how each act of a zone has different music but are yet familiar to keep in check with the tone and setting of the zones.Overall Score: 10/10Why I give it a 10/10? My reasoning is that this is one of the games that I played and i enjoyed it so much that I want to come back to it which is my personal favorite classic sonic game as of now.

Though the witches were able to destroy the Lumen during the course of this war, the exhausted sorceresses’ victory was short-lived. people grew to distrust them & began the witch hunts. All of the Umbra died, all except for one. Suffering from memory loss, the sorceress now lives in present-day North America & tries to piece the clues of her origin back together. After her friend, Enzo, tells her about an object called the Right Eye of the World that would help her remember her past, Bayonetta travels to the fictional city of Vigrid, Spain to find it.The Quality of the PC portTo get the most important question out of the way: Will the PC release from 2017 play on your old computer? Yes, yes, it will. I played this on a 32-bit Windows Vista Home Premium desktop PC with an Intel Core 2 CPU, 3070 MB RAM, DirectX 11, & a GeForce 9500 GT graphics card without any trouble, after I had set the graphics to “Custom” & then lowered every stat. The game ran with 30 frames per second (fps) most of the time, but slowed down to around 15 fps during effect filled scenes. These frame drops are not distracting to those used to playing on weaker rigs. Be that as it may, those with more contemporary machines will be happy to hear that this over-the-top adventure does support 60 fps with a 4k resolution.Bayonetta also lets players freely switch between their gamepad & the keyboard & mouse combination at any point. It’s also great that all keys are rebindable, so that they can use whichever button arrangement they are comfortable with. In view of this, Bayonetta does feature one of the weirdest design choices ever: Moving the mouse around does almost nothing. Sure, some QTEs require players to move the computer mouse in a circular motion, which works fine, but outside of that, it does not control the camera.If one wants the viewing angle readjusted or have it face in a certain direction, they have to press the corresponding keys on their keyboard, which can be distracting in tight situations & feels cumbersome in others. Of course, the game wants players to only occasionally readjust the camera & it has a dedicated key to put it right behind the witch, but it still takes some getting used to.GameplayFrom the get-go Bayonetta blasts off with the speed of light & will continuously keep players’ heart rates at a relaxing 180 bpm. They first meet up with the witch as she fights an onslaught of adversaries on top of a falling clock tower, & things just becomes more absurd as well as extreme as the story goes on, with bosses that are the size of entire buildings, flashy, bright colors, coupled with one-liners. If taken seriously, the game might offend a few people along the way, but most will likely notice that Bayonetta just cranks up everything to “extreme” to give everyone unjaded fun. And as this is an action title by Platinum Games, it really does deliver on the fast-paced combat.Luckily, the developers had put a lot of thought into the difficulty settings to make Bayonetta surprisingly accessible to everyone, with modes ranging from “Very Easy” – wherein the enemies are all weaker & the game helps the player perform combos – to ∞ Climax – wherein angels are incredibly tough & “Witch Time” has been disabled. Even unlocking secret items or playable characters is inclusive as they can be gotten either by fulfilling certain objectives or through the public telephone cheats. Still, some parts of the game are hard, really hard, especially Alfheim.Throughout the game are twenty-one hidden challenge rooms called Alfheim, which require players to understand & implement their knowledge of the mechanics. Though these rooms seem insurmountable at first glance, those who have completed the game at least once or put a little bit of thought into things will find them doable. The vast majority of them can even be beaten after the first couple of tries, except for one room. Alfheim number 12 in Chapter VI, Verse 4 is dreadfully demanding & way too hard. The other smaller gripes are that some cutscenes are of the “press X to not die” variety & that the Umbran Tears Of Blood collectibles don’t make any sound when Bayonetta is near them, making hunting all of them down without a guide almost impossible. Both of these design choices are missteps in an otherwise stellar game.Crotch ShotsThe developers seemed to have conducted a lot of research on witches in medieval Europe & tried to make them more appealing for modern times. Like in folklore, the witches shown in Bayonetta are notably sexual & derive their powers from their hair. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with many in North America for which this title & its sequel (2014) received heavy criticism, but also praise.Sadly, several critics appear to have not informed their reader- & viewerships about women like Mari Shimazaki (島崎麻里, designed Bayonetta), Akiko Kuroda (黒田晶子, producer of Bayonetta 2), or Mai Ohkura (大倉麻衣, concept artist at Platinum Games), who were key personnel in the creation of Bayonetta 1 & 2. Nor did they elaborate on how much the designs drew from European folklore, mysticism, & Judeo-Christian theology, or elaborate on the overall tone of the game, which might have led to a false impression amongst consumers followed by controversy. In the end, the sorceress is not so much a sexualized, but more of a sexually empowered character, comparable to how Dante in DmC: Devil May Cry (2013) is portrayed. Sadly, the same cannot be said for “Joy” in Bayonetta, who is the only angel that’s forced on to the Spanish donkey (often used in BDSM) during one of the witch’s torture attacks. It is the only clearly gendered attack & the game could’ve done without it.ConclusionOverall, Bayonetta is loads of fun to play for anyone who is into bright, action-packed video games, especially since it welcomes both casual & hardcore audiences.  The protagonist is very likable & the way the adventure escalates is simply spellbinding. One ride on this carousel takes around twelve hours, but offers so much replayability that many will find themselves going for a couple more rounds. Unlocking everything requires around 100 hours, quite a lot of mileage for the admission price, during which the game, surprisingly, does not get boring. Unfortunately there are a couple of little things here & there that are an annoyance whenever they pop up – like how finding all collectibles can be quite unintuitive or how some mechanics could’ve been explained better – but are forgotten as soon as the game continues. With all that said, Bayonetta is a great game that really concentrates on fun & spectacle over anything else. Players who are okay with colorful video games will like it.;1;105,8;9/06/2017;541;27;;8.0
