0;Action; 179,99;As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.I should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  So right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  None of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.What kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  I’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.The team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.I’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  I wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.Okay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.The hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  Also I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  I won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  If you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.;1;418,7;24/01/2019;2483;115;;8.0
0;Action; 179,99;After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise. Graphics Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.  Story The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy. The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me. Gameplay If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything. You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities. Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with. As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.  Grind? I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue. Final Recommendation I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss. Pros-Stunning Game World-Interesting Story-Well thought-out RPG mechanics -Tons of things to do-Exhilarating CombatCons-Lame mid-late game pacing-Poor rendering-Executions aren't greatFinal Rating - 8.6/10If you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

0;Action; 179,99;"Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity. an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the ""decisions"" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another. chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!";1;234,8;5/10/2018;1524;32;;8.0
0;Action; 179,99;Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey  ⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:              - Main Story - 43½ Hours              - Main + Extras - 83 Hours               - Completionist - 137 Hours By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review. ⚔ Gameplay: 🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)🔲 Definitely🔲 Infinitely replayableThe game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game. 😄 Fun: 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy☑️ Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember🔲 Ride of your lifeAs a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did. 🏞 Graphics: 🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game🔲 Good (nothing special)☑️ Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceThe graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work. 🔊 Sound: 🔲 Makes your ears bleed🔲 Bad☑️ Not special🔲 Good🔲 Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceI felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven. 📖 Story: 🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story🔲 It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written☑️ Epic story🔲 MasterpieceWithout spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter. 🧵 Length: 🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee🔲 Short🔲 Average☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)🔲 To infinity and beyondAccording to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.I wish it would be shorter. 💷 Price: 🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price☑️ Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of moneyDepending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore. 🧩 Difficulty: 🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it🔲 Easy☑️ Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too. ⚖ Pros & Cons:  ➕ Pros: + The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all. ➖ Cons: - It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.- Too long. I really wish it would be shorter.- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult. only a few of them get that treatment. ⚙ Bugs: 🔲 Never heard of☑️ Minor bugs🔲 Can get annoying🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsI've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU. ⭕Conclusion: AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.Originally posted by TalePlay: If you've read this far, I want to say thank you and do check our Curator Page called TalePlay.

0;Action; 179,99;"I bought the Gold Edition, which seems to have a better value. Here's some info on the different editions:Standard Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game) DELUXE DIGITAL PACK: - Kronos pack - contains the full Armour of Kronos armour set, the Hourglass mount, and the spear ""Harvester of Time"" - this pack gives more warrior damage boost- Herald of Dusk pack - contains the full Herald of Dusk set of armour, and the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focused.- Capricornus Naval Pack - contains the Capricornus boat and sailor skins - purely cosmetic.- Temporary boosts to XP and money - boost lasts for 2 hours.Gold Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)SEASON PASS: LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE, THE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece + The Games: Assassin's Creed III REMASTERED and Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTERED. Ultimate Edition (Digital) Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition - Check the Content Info AboveSEASON PASS - Check the Content Info AboveSo, the only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content. Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on. up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on sale, though I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition.Note:  You can not upgrade to Deluxe Edition later on, meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition, and that's money wasted. Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later on, is not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise. You are saving money and getting the best of the game. For Season Pass owners (which is in the Gold and Ultimate Editions) - Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered will not appear in your library as it is a part of, and available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered. So, in order to play Liberation Remastered, you need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered. Both Remasters are slightly better graphically, than their previous versions. You have to launch Assassin's Creed Odyssey once, before trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition. Otherwise, the Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activation, which is not possible anymore.  For any problems with the Ubisoft client: Verify Integrity of Game Files on Steam and if it doesn't work then uninstall the Ubisoft client and delete the current version and redownload the client from the Ubisoft site. If you still have problems then God help you dealing with Ubisoft/Steam support. The latter has a faster response but both suffer from the same level of retardation.Hopefully, the info will help you, so you don't have to look around various sites or contact the terrible support teams.Ps: If you are interested, feel free to check my Assassin's Creed Black Flag Review - https://steamcommunity.com/id/brake_id/recommended/242050/";1;5,6;19/03/2021;256;3;;0.0

2;Action; 179,99;"(DRM notice: this game requires a Uplay account, requires you to connect to Uplay when starting up, and it also uses Denuvo DRM. DRM is inherently bad for the customer so I wanted to warn you about that.)Far Cry 5 is a decent entry into the series, and often underrated in comparison to previous titles.Honestly, if you played Far Cry 2, 3 or 4 - you know what to expect. Same game, different setting. The main reason people rate it lower than 3 and 4 is because by this point, they've grown tired of the same old formula (and because of the weird ending, but I'm not gonna spoil that... you have to see it for yourself). Far Cry 5 is just as good as its predecessors. That said, let's give this a proper analysis, shall we?You shoot bad guys. This time it's in rural America.It's a Far Cry game. What did you expect? It follows the Ubisoft open world formula of a big world occupied by enemy forces, which you slowly liberate by wiping out enemy outposts like you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rambo. There's a basic but functional stealth system of silent melee takedowns, silent weapons like bows, throwing knives, and silenced guns, and enemies raising the alarm if they see you or find a dead body. You can conquer outposts either by going in slow and methodical, or you can just storm in guns blazing and mow everyone down with an MG. The combat is fun. Controls are pretty smooth, most weapons are satisfying to use, and neither you nor the enemy are bullet sponges. Sometimes you will have to deal with enemy helicopters, or you can fly one yourself to rain death from above. Fun!The only criticism I have compared to earlier Far Cry titles (especially Far Cry 1 and 2) is how the physics engine has been dialed down a bit. Many items are static objects that don't ever move (I kicked a bunch of cans and they just stayed in place... lame), and most cover can't be pierced by bullets, unlike earlier games where thin wooden walls could easily be penetrated by high caliber weaponry. At least the fire spreading mechanics are still there, making the flamethrower a potentially devastating weapon... with which you can easily grill yourself if you're not careful.The game is set in Hope County, a fictional area in the US state of Montana, where a crazy cult is taking over and forcibly recruiting the population. You arrive as a policeman (or policewoman, this is the first Far Cry game with character customization and you get to pick your gender) coming to arrest the leader of that cult, but of course the cultists fight back and you have to run. During the course of the game, you meet with various resistance members and help them fight the cult until they are wiped off the map. The setting is quite enjoyable, especially if you like rural America. As a European, I find American culture quite fascinating, and this game is full of it. All the resistance people are proud American patriots, and you get to see a lot of those weird roadside attractions they have in the rural US, like a park with giant plastic mammoth statues and farms that advertise their tomatoes with giant tomato signs. Very quaint.I got captured... AGAINAs far as the story structure is concerned, the antagonists are pretty interesting and the story overall is competently told. But the way they force you into the main quest missions... yeah, that's definitely questionable. Whenever you earn enough ""Resistance Points"" in a region (by doing side quests or liberating outposts), the bad guys will send a capture party to abduct you. They don't just do it once per region, but several times. When I finished the game, I had been captured at least six times... and if we count the scenes where Faith puts you into a drug-induced trance so she can try and convert you to the cult, that increases to nine times.Nine. Times.And each time, you - of course - manage to escape and kill a whole bunch of cultists in the process. They should have realized that keeping you alive is a bad idea after the second time, but nope. They just keep abducting you and try to convert you to their cause, until you finally kill all the leaders. Of all the methods they could have used to drive the story forward, this is by far the dumbest. It almost feels like the bad guys are deliberately giving you a chance over and over again.The cult leaders are appropriately vile and violent characters, and the acting and animation is really good. I usually hate cutscenes, but I found the ones in Far Cry 5 to be quite engaging, because the characters are so interesting. I have to rate the main story as ""good"", but... the way they keep using that abduction mechanic to drive the plot forward... that's just stupid. So utterly stupid. And the worst part is that it can hit you anywhere once you triggered it. Doing a sidequest right now? Haha sorry, abduction squad is here. Flying around in a helicopter? Yeah there's a sedative arrow in your leg now, don't ask where it came from. It's just dumb.You've seen it before. It's nothing new, but it's good.Really, apart from the dumb way they handled the main story progression with those stupid abduction scenes, Far Cry 5 doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's another competently made Far Cry game. More of the same for people who enjoy this style of game. Open world driving around, shooting bad guys, doing side quests. It even has the same mission types as the previous Far Crys: rescue a friend and man the gun while he drives the truck to your home base, go to a location and kill the enemies, find collectibles and bring them to an NPC, etc etc. The standard fare as usual. Did you play Far Cry 3 or 4? This is like that, except set in Montana instead of a tropical island or Tibet.If you like Far Cry games, you're gonna like this. If you don't, you won't.

2;Action; 179,99;In a nutshell:Pros:1. Good graphics2. Surprises in the story at the end3. Game physics is good4. More involvement of Bosses in game (unlike Far Cry 4), which is good.5. Adds lot more contents in the game when compared to its predecessors.6. Availability of Guns for hire. OR form Your own squad with AI characters, which gets unlocked as the story progress.7. No more tower capture to unlock a region (although some elements of it exists here too)8. More detailed and realistic gun/vehicular battles.9. Support for Co-op in Story mode.10. Arcade mode for some extra game play.Cons:1. Even on pretty good configuration PC(GTX 1070 8GB), FPS drops to 30 sometimes, but not many instances. Probably because the game is tailored for AMD graphics.2. No option to change difficulty in middle of game story. Need to play out entire story in same difficulty level.3. Too much content in Game User Interface (UI) /Map which causes the UI to be cluttered.4. If You are someone who is moving up the far cry timeline and played FC3 and FC4 before this, You might take at least an hour of game play to understand the game features.5. In gun battles, hit reg not accurate sometimes.6. Co-op in story mode restricted to only 2 players in total (i.e. Yourself and one friend).7. If You invite Your friend to play in Co-op, only Your story proceeds/missions complete, and your friend's does not. Above Pros and Cons should be sufficient if You do not have time to read through the detailed review and need to decide if You want to buy this game or not. More detailed review below.P.S: Please play this game before playing Far Cry: New Dawn, to enjoy the new dawn instalment better.In Detailed Review:The Game:Unlike prior Far cry instalments, this game environment has more modern vibes to it. So, You'll have more modern weapons, and visiting a place on the map reveals it. No more tower climbing to remove cloaking.Basically, the map is a group of islands, ruled over by one main Boss (The Father) and 3 under bosses (His 2 brothers and 1 sister, well not biological though, haha). They together form a cult and make life hell for the natives. Its either join the cult or face Your maker, simple right?So, You play the role of a rookie deputy who will fight Your way to liberate the islands, and there is lots of story and elements to it on the way.The bosses:Each boss brings in their own flavour and elements to the story and game play, which is kind of good and makes missions less repetitive. The more outposts You liberate (not many, may be 4 to 5 outposts per boss) and more missions You complete (given by the natives), the more interest the local boss takes in You, taking you closer to defeat them.The Vehicles:A wide variety of Vehicles available, like trucks, vans, SUVs, boats etc along with the new addition of airplanes and helicopters, which can be used in free roam and missions.Guns for Hire:Basically 2 types:Type 1: CivilianEach civilian You rescue from the cults grasp during free roam can be used as a Gun for hire during next mission, until You release them. They ride with You, they can die for You, kill for You with guns blazing or with stealth. They can be found all over the map. No specialisations as such, good for regular gun fights.Type 2: Story AI CharactersThe other set of Guns for hire are the characters which are unlocked as You progress in main story. This set of Guns for hire are specialists and can be added to your squad. They can be called upon whenever You need them. There are 9 of these specialists which includes 3 animals and rest humans. The human specialists include a sniper, an airplane pilot, a helicopter pilot, a crossbow specialist (for stealth), a missile man etc. You can form a squad with them or call them in separately.Skills:Unlike prior instalments, skills in FC5 can be unlocked by finishing challenges. The challenges (which can be viewed in Map menu) needs to be completed to get reward points. These reward points can be used to unlock skills. Some challenges (for example) are get 10 kills with grenade, 8 kills with knife throw, 20 Melee kills, 5 road kills etc. So, higher the game difficulty, completing some challenges might get a bit difficult as game AI gets better.Skills are similar to FC3 and FC4, not many changes here. One difference I noticed is, no more crafting for weapon bag, loot bag, weapon holster etc by hunting animals for skins. This too needs reward points now. So make sure where You spend Your reward points well. Weapons:Anything and everything from a knife to arrow, pistol to assault and sniper rifles, from Grenade launchers to guided RPGs. If You have DLCs purchased too, You get martian weapons as well. You can carry upto 4 weapons at a time, provided You have unlocked the large weapon holster by using those reward points.Overall I would definitely recommend the game.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 7/10Attention to details: 6/10Thanks for reading the detailed review.

2;Action; 179,99;I've been a fan of Far Cry since the 3rd game, and was pretty excited for this one. I was not disappointed for the most part. As a fan of the series I have a lot to say about this game, so be preprared for a long read.PROS+ Looks amazing and is well optimized+ Soundtrack is great, including the radio songs+ Joseph Seed, the antagnoist, while not as good as Vaas or Pagan Min, is still good and really feels intimidating.+ Enemies actually have motivation and purpose, as opposed to the mindless pirates in FC3 or the braindead soldiers in FC4+NPCs have stuff to say now, they can tell you about locations, bases, hidden stashes, etc. Some even have conversations with each other that are fun to listen to, huge improvment from the old NPCs who were basically just there to be eaten by animals. The main NPCs are great and memorable too.+Lots more wildlife than the previous games, even have challenges to hunt them+Fishing is cool I guess, it's actually engaging and not an AFK activity like fishing in most games+ Planes and Helicopters are now in the game, and you can buy and customize vehicles instead of having to find them+ The bosses besides Joseph are more fleshed out and have their own methods and personalities.+ Companions are a new addition and are great, they never feel like a burden and can be instructed. Peaches is my personal favorite+ New resistance system is cool, you complete lots of varied activities in the world until you have enough points to face the regional boss and liberate the region.NEUTRAL~ I'm personally not a fan of the setting, I live in the U.S. so Montana isn't all that intersting to me, I'd much rather travel somehwere far away and exotic, however they do pull it off well, the atmosphere is great and I can see why people love it~ Co-op is an absolute blast however friends can't progress with you, you have to do each person's game twice~ Arcade is meh and most of the maps are player made and suck. Wish you could choose to only play Ubisoft mapsCONS- Hunting only yields you money, gone are the days of crafting upgrades, which is a huge shame, the old system was much more engaging.- Weapon variety is pretty bad, most weapons are just reskins of the same gun, even the unique weapons are identical to the standard versions, and they don't require anything to unlock, just more money, which is strange because the standard weapons are locked until you get enough resistance points, you can get the unique AKM before the standard one, it makes no sense at all.- Perks feel underwhelming compared to previous games.- Enemy planes and helicopters spawn way too often, feels more like a chore to kill them rather than and exciting battle.-No bladed melee weapons, I miss cutting people up with my machete/khukuri :(-Microtransactions for skins. Why was this necessary? It doesn't even cost much to unlock things with in-game money.Overall I think the game is good and definitely lives up to the Far Cry franchise, there are issues that bug me but they didn't ruin my experience. I think you'll enjoy this game, it's worth the full 60$, something that can be seldom said about games in this industry nowdays.;1;34,2;31/03/2018;847;28;;8.0
2;Action; 179,99;The Patriot simulatorI'll start with the bottom line: All in all, its 'yet another far cry game', similar to how FC3, FC4 and to some extent FC Primal look and behave.* Story (with no spoilers) - You're playing as a deputy who tries to arrest a cult leader that has taken control of a county in Montana. This cult is made of religious extremists who believe the end is upon us and they must 'cull the herd' aka kill the weak to save the strong and be ready for 'the collapse' which is their modern version of the biblical flood i guess.Things go to sh*t when trying to arrest him and you and your group end up in a gang-war type of scenario which you must survive till you find shelter. From there, the game actually begins just like any other FarCry game begins - You're saved by an npc that instructs you on how to start managing yourself in the map's sorroundings.Been there, done that.* Map - Roughly on the same size as FC3/4/Primal in terms of total size, but is much more condensed and has a lot more things to do in it. The game overall feels more of a GTA V's free roam when it comes to side-events that you find while traversing it. You will find lots of friendlies and enemies driving around and packed action is basically everywhere.events like hostage rescue are very common, as well as helping out npc's on the road with their random problems.* Followers - The game has added npc follower mechanic which works pretty well. You can add upto 2 specific followers with you and they can level up as they kill enemies to gain buffs. Most of these npc's are scattered across the world map and each has their own buffs, so finding new npc's as followers is a game of roulette that will either reward or screw you in terms of how good the followers will be. You have a total of 9 special followers that are story-bound, and countless of scattered npc's that can be used as random followers, which you can only 'store' up to 3 on your followers list. You can command followers to move to certain spots, kill specific enemies, and even revive you if you're dying. Long press to make them follow you again. Each follower has its own command key so they can do different things if you order them different actions.* Guns - You can have upto 4 gun slots in your inventory (3 big weapons + 1 sidearm) + 1 slot for melee weapons + your own fists which you can use at anytime with your actual weapon (similar to Duke Nukem's kicks in the classic game Duke Nukem 3D). There are a few dozens of weapons in the game, ranging between melee weapons, pistols, smgs, rifles, snipers, and heavy guns like lmg's and rpg's.* Skill tree - Works a bit differently than previous FC games. Its a mashup of badass ranks from Borderlands 2 and previous FC titles. Instead of steady xp gain, you get skill points on certain actions that you do, like completing missions and finishing world objectives and achievements. You spend the skill points on perks just like previous FC titles. All the ammo/holster upgrades are managed through this skill tree, so theres no more benefit in hunting animals for these kind of upgrades. Animal hides can be sold for money but that's it.* AI - Enemy's AI seems to have a small improvement from earlier FC titles. They will take more time to detect you and their aim wont be as punishing as previous FC titles (tested on the hardest difficulty). Follower's AI can be wonky at times, but overall its tolerable.* Arcade mode - An added minigame that lets you play with and against other people in 6v6 matches or in co-op mode against AI enemies like zombies/aliens/humans. There is also a feature that lets you build your own levels and play other people's levels.* Uplay - The obvious elephant in the room - This game has some issues with Steam, even if you buy it directly from Steam, since it forces you to have Uplay installed and tells you to create a Uplay account for it anyway. From my experience, there are a few issues while playing this game that you should be aware of, though your milage may vary:1) When opening and then closing the steam overlay in mid game, there is a slight chance (of about 20%-30%) that the mouse will stop responding. This has been confirmed to only happen in this game so its not a mouse issue. If this happens to you, tab out of the game and tab back in to fix it.2) The more annoying issue: When pressing shift+f2 to bring up the Uplay interface (the equalevant of the Steam interface), there is a good chance the windows' mouse cursor will appear (and stay stuck) in the middle of the screen until you quit the game (will start happening after leaving uplay's interface and going back into the game). The only proper fix i've found for this is to restart the game. Sometimes, switching to 'borderless' mode instead of 'full screen' helps, but its not a guarantee.3) You cant rebind the tab button, which means that if pressing tab in mid game, it will always pause the game and switch to the map view. Sounds nice, but since you can't rebind it, you have to put up with constant game interruptions if you want to shift+tab to the Steam overlay while already in a game menu, as doing this will unpause your game in the process. In other words, you will have to be aware to not be in an in-game menu screen when tabbing into the steam overlay.Im fairly suspicious that these 3 issues are caused deliberatedly by Ubisoft to make Steam users avoid playing the game via the Steam interface and encourage them to migrate into Uplay entirely.* Performance - The game runs at an avg of 80 fps in high-ultra settings at 1440p with Radeon RX 5700XT GPU and Ryzen 5 2600x CPU. No big frame drops seemed to appear and its overall well optimized in my opinion.As for the DLC's...Lost on Mars - A 6-7 hours campaign that puts you on Mars with Hurk. This is a really nice DLC with incredible graphics and superb futuristic weapon designs. Lots of action packed and overall highly recommended.Hours of Darkness - A 3.5-4 hours campaign that puts you on a Vietnam rescue mission. This DLC is quite disappointing as the objectives are very generic with no real incentive to explore the map. Its also fairly easy with the weapons they give you from the beginning. No sense of progress and all in all it feels really rushed.Living Dead Zombies - A very short 1.5 hours gameplay that is split between 7 micro stories that Guy Marvel is trying to form about (yet another) zombie apocalypse. You play the role of the hero in each of these stories and basically he forms them while you traverse it from the world he's building around you, similar to Borderlands 2's DLC with Tiny Tina (but with zero character build up). The DLC shows how Guy Marvel is trying to pitch 7 ideas to different producers for them to build a movie from.This is the most disappointing DLC of the bunch as it offers by far the least amount of content and priced the same as the rest. Give it a hard pass.So, which FarCry 5 version should you buy?The basic one. Period. I've bought the Gold one as i thought the 3 DLC's will give me lots of extra hours to grind on each, but the reality was that only the Mars DLC was worth it, both in terms of length and gameplay/story. Some other things i've recieved were free cosmetics and a few extra weapons and cars that pretty much screamed 'pay to win', alongside some fancy cosmetics. Since in game money isn't a big issue in the game, i simply can't recommend buying the gold version for these extra gadgets as you can buy them later on from vendors anyway.So to sum it up: Buy the base game and the mars DLC individually, when they're on sale. Pass on the rest.In summary:As said in the beginning, when you boil it all up, its basically 'more FarCry', which comes with all the good and some of the bad of the previous titles. So if you loved playing the recent FarCry games, you will sure love this, but it doesn't seem to add anything that is new to the formula.;1;80,2;2/05/2020;192;5;;5.0

2;Action; 179,99;"Far Cry 5As a person who played through Far Cry 1 to Far Cry New Dawn I can say that this series had it's own falls and rises. And Far Cry 5 stays somewhere in the middle. Anyway, let's get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Cool partner system.+ Decent story. It was interesting at the start, boring in the middle and cool at the end.+ Stashes with cash are mostly interesting to solve.+ Clutch Nixon's challenges are really cool to do especially with a friend.+ Planes and Helicopters are really fun and good addition to the game.Cons:- There are some funny additional missions but most of them are boring.- Most of the additional and even main characters feel poorly written and not interesting.- It's mostly a game with the same mechanics and I don't mind it in some way but why remove good mechanics? For example, you don't need to hunt animals anymore because they only give you money for their skins and not an upgraded holster, etc like in previous parts.- If you play co-op your friend will not complete the story on their character which is some straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because my friend literally couldn't level up skills because the requirement is to kill a boss who we killed but it counts only for the host and he couldn't even buy guns because in his story he didn't reach a resistance level for it. I give this game a 6/10.Far Cry New DawnAnd I want to give a quick review of this game here as I didn't play it on Steam.Pros:+ Cool aesthetic design for everything. Map, animals, bikers, guns. Guns are especially cool.+ Really cool animations on silent kills. Made me wanna say ""oof"" for that poor guy who I stabbed in the eye.+ Story is a sequel of course. Simple and good I would say. + Sorties are especially cool and even unique to the series. Capturing a valuable bag and getting out in many different places is what I really enjoyed. Cons:- Partners are even cooler and funnier here but sometimes I don't get how they are so weak to instantly die from a lvl 1 biker.- Kinda short for its price.I give it a 7.5/10 but buy it on a sale.";1;25,9;24/06/2020;457;11;;6.0
2;Action; 179,99;"I'm giving this a good review because I liked it and plan to play through it again for giggles, but I'm going to start by saying I don't think everyone will enjoy this.  Here's why I liked it:1.  Shooting mechanics are pretty tight and intuitive.  I know that's really basic, but if it's off in a FPS that just kills it for me.2.  I love the premise.  This setting and the idea of this game just jives with me.  I'm fascinated by prepper culture and cults.  Riding around in a pickup truck shooting guns at a bunch of psychos with my redneck buddies is just my idea of a good time.3.  They actually tried really hard to give this game personality.  Thing is there's not a lot of acting in the game, it's not an RPG, but what's there is really solid.  They took great pains to make it really look like Montana.  You will hate the villains and you will like the good guys (Poor Jess!). they did a lot with very little.  Also the soundtrack of this game is freaking amazing, and it looks really good.4.  I'm a working adult, I like games I can play for 20 minutes and get something done.  I also like story driven FPS.  This works for me.Here's why I think other people wouldn't like it:1.  Very, very loose approach to the narrative.  If you are one of those people who loses interest in a show when the characters do something that doesn't strictly make logical sense, or you lose your mind when you encounter a plot hole, you're going to hate this.  If you can just kick back and say ""it's just a game"", or make up the reasons in your head why something happened, (i.e. you have a strong suspension of disbelief like I do) you'll be okay.  But a lot of things happen that just don't make any sense, if that bothers you, you won't like it.2.  The multiplayer aspects didn't thrill me, though I like the Arcade feature, that one's good, the rest... meh.3.  The bullet drop with sniper rifles drives some people crazy.4.  A friend of mine who tried this thought it was more like an RPG, and while it has a few light RPG style elements, it's not an RPG.  It's a shooter with some character customization.I highly recommend you buy it on sale, even if it sounds good to you.   I mean I've played more money for worse games, but at least this way if you don't like it you're not out too much.";1;220,0;17/02/2020;171;7;;7.0

3;Action; 784,72;"DISCLAIMER: I hate Ubisoft's open world games to an exponential degree and as such I had no interest in W_D2. However following the word of mouth, I got into the game a few weeks back. This review is for people who were burned by WD1 or just interested people in general  PROS: +Adapts a wider colour palette for San Francisco, ditching the depressing Greyish tone from WD1 altogether.+The option of completing the entire game non-lethally.+A casual, more light-hearted story that is self-aware and reflects upon the current Internet culture, with wacky characters.+Character customization is more diverse as opposed to the first game's preset clothing.+Radio towers, a plethora of collectibles and outposts have been removed altogether. +You have a lot more options with hacking. Call the SWAT on a NPC or place him on a gang's hitsquad. Cause a static vehicle to accelerate forward much to the surprise of the driver. This culminates in what people call Emergent Gameplay.+Online activities like Bounty hunter, Invasions and Co-op operations lend to longevity.+PC Version is also a significant step-up from first one. Favours numerous graphics options and a FOV slider. CONS: -Unsatisfying Gunplay. Customization of firearms is barebones.-Basic Stealth system. Cover mechanics is janky AF.-Braindead AI.-Vehicles controlling is more arcade-y. but improved from the first game.-Some rather bland mission designs. (Go to X, Hack Y, Watch a cutscene, Mission complete) VERDICT: Watch Dogs 2 came as a surprise to me. It got rid of a lot of stuff that Ubisoft is infamous for and opted for a better game world, the result is a far superior product than the previous title. It's not an absolute ""OHMAGERD 10/10 GAYME HAS DOGES IN IT"" that some people claim it to be but Ubisoft is making the right changes in its IPs, albeit little ones. If anyone is still on the fence after WD1, give this one a chance, you'll be fairly pleased.";1;57,0;28/05/2017;576;15;;8.0

4;Action; 169,99;"PSA To Everyone Wanting To Purchase This Title:   • Crashing Game has a terrible crashing issue for the majority of the player-base that's been going on for about 2 years now.People have tried fixing it themselves alongside Ubisoft Developers but all of the fixes seemed to be only temporary, a mere Windows Update or a Game Update could reintroduce the issue all over again, rendering the game unplayable for a lot of the players. (Ignore the trolls saying that it's a YOU issue, it isn't)  I've played the game on 3 different systems and I've had the same issue on all 3 of them, some better, some worse.There is an 8 hour trial of the game on Uplay, I'd strongly advise trying it out before purchasing as your system might be prone to crashing. • Ubisoft Connect The game opens up a ""lite"" version of Ubisoft Connect launcher in the background, I know some people don't like games which use third party launchers, so just throwing it out there.Furthermore, if you own the game on there, your progression is the same on Steam as long as your accounts are linked with one another.ALSO,  If you owned the Warlords of New York DLC on Uplay, you can purchase the Standard Edition of the game on Steam(without the DLC) and still have DLC within the game. • Potentially Slower Update Cycle? Game is mainly on life support, main team moved on to work on Star Wars/Avatar.Potentionally last year of support(Take this with a grain of salt, I am simply guessing based off of their social media) • Weird Paywall • Endgame locked behind a DLC paywall (Warlords of New York)If you decide against purchasing it you'll be stuck at level 30.  Positives:  • Decent time sinkEven after 1,000+ hours I've had things to do• A lot of different types of PvE activites of varying difficulties• Beautiful Open WorldBoth Washington D.C and New York have a ton of activities, collectables, etc..• Decent sense of progression• Good sound design• AI isn't dumbThey used to oneshot you across the map with a shotgun, they toned them down and now they're alright• Different types of builds with depth for different types of playersSniper, Shotgun, SMG, Skill builds, ""Tank"", Healer...• Pretty fair build making in generalYou can optimize and reroll gear as you wish with very few limitations• Works on Steam Deck (Disable DX12)  Mixed: • Bullet sponge enemiesIt isn't as bad as the first game and it's subjective to a lot of the things(Difficulty, what type of an enemy it is, your build)• Weak Story (It is a looter shooter, sort of expected)• Nerfs of ""meta"" gear, farming routes, yet hardly any buffsThere hasn't been any in a while, but it always felt like people in charge of this disliked players feeling powerful.• No AchievementsNot one I care about personally, but I see people complaining about it.If anything, there are achievements in game which grant you certain rewards.  Negatives: • No in-game matchmaking for RaidsThis wouldn't be such a big issue if there wasn't any gear locked behind this content.I also know some people just don't like going out of their way to find a group to do it with(Discord, Reddit...etc)• Performance could be better• PvP isn't its strong suit, and it clearly was an afterthought whilst creating the game.Current PTS changes have some interesting improvements in terms of it, but if you're buying this game and expecting fleshed out PvP experience, this game isn't for you.• You're sort of forced to purchase the DLC (WONY) if you want to do any of the actual EndGame content, there aren't that many players staying at level 30Final Thoughts & Would I Recommend The Game?Yes, without a doubt if the crashing is fixedIf you're serious about getting into the franchise, I'd strongly suggest getting the first game because it's an actual functional video game-Edit:  Will update the review if for some reason the Steam version of the game crashes less or at all -Edit 2:  Game crashed after 30 minutes of playtime, refunded -Edit 3:  I'll be deleting all of the comments which link old YouTube videos/Forum posts in the comments, it adds nothing to the conversation but misinformation.99% of these ""fixes"" are nothing more than placebo. -Edit 4: ""So many negatives yet you gave it a positive review?""Yes, I did.I've spent thousands of hours playing/watching this game over the years, and it would feel unfair if I just completely disregarded all of that and went straight for the jugular.The game is fun and there is a ton of things to do/learn within it's world. (When it works)Considering the price tag of $18 for the whole package, this feels like a no-brainer decision.The main issue this game struggles with right now is the crashing, most of the other things can be ignored since they're prone to changing in the future (Like PvP for an example) -Edit 5:  Mr.Thunder  Consider making your own review rather than stealing this one, appreciate it.

Could have used more content to flesh the origin of Cal Kestis and his journey entirely. Introduction Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. It follows the story of Cal Kestis, a Jedi who survived order 66 by hiding in a planet as a scrap worker. It features elements from multiples sub-genres in the action category and incorporates them to elevate its gameplay further. From lightsaber combat to climbing and soul-likes bosses, the game grabs a bit from each of the best titles but not to the point those mechanics would obscure its own identity. Gameplay The combat is simple but also is a lot of fun. It has vast layers put into it that can appear rather lackluster at first. Still, they are intelligent choices from the developer. Cal Kestis has access to his lightsaber for physical combat and the force to open his options. Lightsaber techniques can range from throwing it towards enemies before it comes back. Different combos or forms, while the force can range from pushing back grenades towards enemies, force pulling, slowing enemies, and more.Players have a ton of options when facing the stormtroopers. You can push them off cliffs, throw them into one another, reflect beams at them, or cut them down with parries, to name just a few. It gives the player freedom to how they will approach any encounter with them or try new ideas. Hurl something at them, put them in front of their own blaster, forcing them towards you. The game has a lot of  possibilities.The platforming aspect of the game is also again, a successful decision in design. There are multiple ways to reach an objective on the map. For example, you can get to the next goal, die, take another path, and achieve that same destination. What is great about this is that those paths are very different when it comes to traveling itself and that they reward exploration. You can visit areas in the order you want, even as far as to go to planets you are not prepared for or discover secret places to visit later.It borrows aspects from games like Zelda, Metroid, Uncharted, Dark Souls. It then incorporates Cal Kestis mechanics into them to make them unique to the game. Puzzles and exploration being limited until you unlock new abilities, platforming that involves using the force to expand one's reach. Approach to level design, and finally combat that mixes dodging, parrying, smart use of the force and lightsaber combat.It is rewarding to be able to visit prior planets and discover that now you can take that path that was blocked before. Enemies being added in locations and exploring side stuff such as collectibles or hidden ways. Enemies have a defense meter, like a shield of sorts and until the player doesn't deplete that they won't be able to damage them. The combat is focused on reaction to how the player reacts to the enemy's attacks and groups of them. All of them have unblockable attacks, and bosses are ferocious with brutal powers and agile movements. Strong points The strong points are its story, that while it has some flaws, it is an enjoyable journey and manages to captivate what makes Star Wars so great as a franchise. The gameplay doesn't get boring because of new enemies showing up from time to time, keeping it fresh, along with the variety of options the player has. Bosses are exciting, particularly the last ones are hard to beat, and they give intense duels.The integration of elements from other games is a concept that I like. Bringing a more refined quality in gameplay but also being careful not to let those elements get to carried away and making the game into a copy of those other games. Finally, customization while the ponchos and ship can be some recolors. the lightsabers have a lot of customization into them. All colors are present except for red. you can change the hilt. The material, the handle, just about everything about them, and let's be honest lightsabers are very cool. It allows one to personalize the aesthetics of Cal Kestis to suit their particular tastes. Story The plot revolves around Cal Kestis, a young man who works to earn his living on a planet controlled by the empire. The plot follows up after the purge of the Jedi after order 66, and Kestis being a Jedi padawan, spends most of his days in hiding. One day, however, he is discovered by the empire. After escaping certain death, he ends up meeting Cere Junda, a former Jedi who managed to escape the Purge of Order 66 and the pilot Greez Ditus, the Mantis ship's owner.Without spoiling too much, the story is good, but both the beginning and the ending of it lack specific amounts of flesh. The start of the game is sprung while the end is abrupt. However, the rest of it is rich in detail, with information on the planets that you visit, references to famous characters and events. Good pacing that allows for character development and for the player to get to know these characters.The exploration of planets adds layers to the lore game, especially if you already heard of them before. The story has the premises of a Star Wars film. Comedic moments that can give a laugh or darker ones that can emanate conflicting thoughts or uncertainty of how things will play out. It is fantastic and one of the best aspects of the game. Some Notes The games run faulty on a GTX 1060. it runs okay in a GTX 1070 and anything above that it runs flawlessly. I could notice that in 1060, there were a lot of frame drops, so I would not recommend it for GTX 1060 users unless you don't mind playing in 30 FPS, which is less than ideal. There are also some bugs such as getting stuck in a wall or BD never turning off the scanner light, but those were few, rare instances.UPDATE: So users report the game doing well on a GTX 1060, while others said it has lots of frame drops. In our experience, the game did not run well on a 1060 but it did on a 1070. If you have a 1060, you will have to try it yourself to see if it runs well or not. Conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is probably one of the best games released in 2019. While the game doesn't manage to make something revolutionary or unique, it certainly knows how to add other elements and taking them into what Star Wars means. The combat, while simple, has a lot of freedom build into it, and the platforming-backtracking is excellent. Whenever you are a Star Wars fan or not, this is a game that you should consider getting.If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/";1;13,1;26/11/2019;954;49;;10.0
7;Action; 199,00;"Jedi Fallen Order is, by quite a big margin, the most surprising title of the year for me, not only compared to the expectations I had for it, which were admittedly pretty low, but for how genuinely brilliant this game achieves to be.It's true, Fallen Order really looks like a greatest hits of all the major and most appreciated mechanics we've seen in single player videogames in the last few years: we have bombastic cinematic moments took straight from the Uncharted series (if you played Uncharted 2, you'll probably find the first hour of the game to be hilarious, in that sense), tombs with puzzles to solve and walls to jump onto that seem borrowed from the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy, a combat system very similar to what we recently saw in Sekiro by From Software but, thankfully, they never end up falling in the ""been there, done that"" zone and they always feel extremely polished and cohesively combined, returning us a fantastic experience that is far more than the sum of its parts. The level design by Respawn is also top notch, with an intricate map design that is both a joy to explore in every corner the first time, in order to find secrets and hidden optional enemies, and fun to return to once you unlocked those abilities you were missing and that you can now use to reach places you couldn't get to before. The difficulty is well balanced and, at the hardest setting, it gives you a nice challenge without resulting too frustrating: this is definitely the difficulty to pick if you're experienced with action games like Sekiro. The story is coherent and serviceable, enriched by a cast of interesting characters you'll most likely want to know more about (sadly our main guy isn't one of them, that is the one thing that never changed from my initial impressions). On the technical side the game is also very solid, with great graphics and an extremely polished PC port. the only issues I encountered during my playthrough were all due to the integration with Origin, which is something they really can't drop soon enough. All things considered, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a brilliant game that everyone should at least consider playing, even if they're not particularly interested in the Star Wars universe (I'm not a massive fan of the saga myself).

I FEEL like a Jedi... not infinitely powerful, but, one who's vulnerable, scared, and learning to survive and thrive. I feel empowered. I feel rewarded. I feel like Luke... but I am Cal. And being Cal is a wonderful, beautiful experience, from the graphics to the music to the subtle world-building.... Respawn  made magic.They deserve your attention, and you deserve to experience this wonderful, beautiful story. Please don't miss out on this.;1;34,1;19/11/2019;885;28;;10.0

9;Action; 229,00;I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.I bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!Every single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??It's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!;0;587,4;4/08/2021;2192;72;;2.0
9;Action; 229,00;"Plagued by hackers, almost no oceania community, devs don't care, hackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still haven't been banned. Lazy.Edit: Wow this review got a lot more publicity than I expected! That being said, now that I've played a bit more I'd like to revise my initial thoughts. Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good game, the bullet ballistics are good, team work and strategy is good, the graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good. But all this is over-arched by critical flaws that I'm guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasn't likely to be as profitable as they were expecting. Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency. Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few ""specializations"" for each weapon, mostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things. The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers. They obviously knew their time wouldn't make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best. There's a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement. It's been abandoned, players don't get banned, reports don't get answered. If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield series, there's definetly fun to be had but heres a few tips:* Avoid official servers: that's right, the official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers. EA you should be ashamed.* Consider avoiding if you live in a remote area: In Australia today I was able to find just 1 conquest server with 40 players and able to at least play the game (10AM on a Wednesday). I really can't guarantee that there will be any player base if you live somewhere more exotic than Australia, USA and Europe are probably okay. Don't count on being able to find a server if you're a night owl like me.Overall this game had a lot of potential but it stands as a hollow shell of what it could have been. I liked the inclusion of female characters and being able to play as someone who I felt more of a connection to but the amount of hostility EA showed towards their player base was uncalled for and instead of making up for it they took the money and ran.";0;54,0;29/06/2020;1113;55;;2.0

11;Action;00,00;"If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.Let me put that into perspective:  541 Days and 16 Hours.  Of dota 2. I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was ""addicted"" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.But I've also relatively learned nothing.Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people,  because  of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: ""what if I just did ... instead"" or ""what if I just played on a more casual level"". The issue is, that dota  feels  more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.Thank you for all that you  have  done for me.

11;Action;00,00;"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you.Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.1. general thoughts and how i started:I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music""  or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of ""oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)).

12;Action; 162,00;"10/10 would wait 15 years again.EDIT: Well, this is getting more eyes than expected and that sounded bad. In a nut-shell, I really love this game, here's my experience, spoiler free so far:The first 10 seconds were breathtaking, literally. I've been playing VR since 2018, a lot of games, and while the first moments of it were amazing, the feeling of presence went down a bit as I went along, playing more games. But this, this is something else. The attention to detail is amazing.Performance is fantastic, I don't really know how they manage to pull that quality and achieve steady 90 fps. That's a technical achievement for sure.As for world interaction / controls, they are the best they can possible be. I've played Boneworks and having physics everywhere is kinda interesting, but just as a concept. Going up a ladder in Boneworks or climbing was awful. The rest was good.HL:A merges the best of two worlds. There's physical interactions for moments where they are needed, but they won't get in your way at all. And I really love that, because is just a frigging game, not a simulation. For example, going up a ladder here, is simple. Opening a door too. It won't get smashed in your face, only features necessary collisions. Also I really love how they went all in and gave physic properties to some enemies. That increases immersion by tons!The hacking puzzles, I had my expectations low, but oh boy, I was really wrong. They are quite fun to do, they are challenging but not tiresome. They provide random patterns so the challenge always stay fresh.The sounds are amazing, I had to take my helmet because I thought a rat came into my room. Then I thought it was a faulty hard disk. Nope. It was the game. I believe the sound experiments they did with CS:GO carried over here and it really shows. Character voices were a bit loud tho.The Half-Life winks are amazing. And for someone who played them all, spent 10 years making a HL mod and basically kickstart a game dev career, it was tear inducing.My only complain is the ammo system. While I love the Tresspasser reference (""Two mags left!"") I really wish I could store back some pistol ammo. I thought that was going to bit a bit more arcade-y, but it's okay, it really helps to build up some tension.I was going to try the game for a bit, ended up playing like 5 hours straight. Couldn't really put it down.The upgrade system is a nice addition. Also for the different enemy types. It's an evolved Half-Life in every way, and is what I expected and much much more.Now, I will get a bit sad for other companies, because they set the bar incredibly high.AAA VR games will be like this, or better, and can't say how really happy that makes me.Go and play it right now and be part of history as this is the VR break trough everybody expected.";1;49,5;24/03/2020;2321;372;;10.0

Valve, Half-Life and their other titles saved me from a very dark time 13 years ago. And every Valve title that comes out I give my full attention. This game brought back the feelings of mystery, wonder, and concern on how my favorite characters were going to end up. Even with the knowledge of future events, as this is a prequel, it left you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The story was brilliantly written, and no one could have for seen where it was going. A pivotal roll in Half-Life's overall story and a must play for any fan of the franchise. The graphics were absolutely stunning, and the Source Engine has been changed for the better. Comparing Source with Source 2 is like Source Gold with Source. Stunning difference! Physics are still wonky from time to time, but this made me appreciate it even more. Just like old times!Valve seems to already be on top of patches, so I'll leave the little bugs alone as they have been updating it pretty often over the last few days.I have some issues with how it functions for lower end headsets, like the Samsung Plus, as grenade throwing can be a bit wonky with the controllers going outside the camera's zone. But I don't really think this Valve related per-say, though the amount of times you need to USE grenades could be a bit lower. But all in all, for a lower end Windows headset like mine, I don't have many grips. Controls worked flawlessly and all responded correctly. I used continuous motion but I did find myself using the Teleport to get to places quicker. So a nice medium mix between the two was my sweet spot. Lots of options to mess around with, especially if you get motion sick.I must point out the VAST amount of options you have available. Valve thought of a lot of people with this title to appeal to as many as they could. From Colorblind options to Light Sensitivity for people who suffer from Epilepsy. You can even play with one hand. Teleport, Smooth Motion, and Hybrids are BOTH options. So people who like either one, or both, can use what they are comfortable with. Valve just added Smooth Turning and they also have snap turning if it makes you motion sick. Play around with it, you'll find your sweet spot.All in all, for any Half-Life and Valve fan, this is a MUST! If you don't have a VR to play it, go grab a cheaper one and experience it for yourself. You DON'T NEED an Index to play this game! If you're sure VR is not your thing, go watch a play through on YouTube and support Valve to keep encouraging them to make more games like Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. They seem to have their spark back, and by the gods the STILL have what it takes to make masterpiece games.This final message, though I know they will never see it, is a Thank you to Valve. Thank you for making this game. Thank you for taking me back to a time where I discovered this series. And thank you for continuing to influence my life with all the things you have done for us! Please keep making games, and Thank you so much!;1;46,2;25/03/2020;1441;24;;10.0

12;Action; 162,00;"About 3 hours in, I need to take a break. Here are my initial thoughts in easily-digestible point-by-point form:The game's tech outperformed even my pretty significant expectations. It's by far the best looking (and sounding) VR game I've played. Crucially, the image quality is fantastic, with absolutely no visible aliasing outside of very extreme cases of fine specular detail. And despite all that it maintains a pretty solid 144 (!!) FPS. Sure, I have a fast PC, but it's still a highly competent showing from the engine.The grabbity gloves are an absolutely amazing mechanic. The first 2 times I tried to use them it was a bit awkward, and my reaction was a slightly disappointed ""hmm, that's it?"". The third time it felt better. The fourth time it felt absolutely amazing. And from that point on I just grabbed and threw stuff around everywhere without even thinking about it. This is an extremely polished mechanism of interaction.The attention to detail is great. From startling the cat from the first balcony, over the extremely cool looking puzzles to the interactions with NPCs, to the major scenes, all of it looks like it had a lot of care put into it.Even Valve doesn't have access to magic. While the physics are better (more stable and more conducive to smooth gameplay) than anything else I've played, it's still not too hard to make things explode.Headcrabs. ♥♥♥♥ those.Overall, I can already confidently say that everyone who has access to a VR system should absolutely play this game.";1;4,6;23/03/2020;2007;73;;10.0
13;Action; 4,49;The first Portal had genius, original gameplay mechanics, great story, great level progression, great voice acting, great characters, great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 1, you are a bad person.This sequel brings all those qualities to a new level: _the story is deep_, lots of wow moments, graphics is beautiful, much more levels, environments and elements to solve the puzzles, the co-op multiplayer is so fun it's epic.In my heart and in my mind I have no doubt: _this is the best game ever made_.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 2, you understand nothing about videogames.;1;6,5;11/06/2017;2977;93;;10.0

13;Action; 4,49;Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to sciencePortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to T2: Judgement Day when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.Pros+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this. +Stephen Merchant and J.K Simmons did an absolutely terrific job. Ellen McLain’s performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original!+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by Mike Morasky and The National. +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story. +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. Cons-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV.-Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.  The Bottom LinePortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson. perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer. Highly recommend it to……everyone. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try. My Rating: 10/10  Thank You :D;1;31,4;28/06/2020;288;27;;10.0

16;Action; 299,90;I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.  I found it was full of trolls.  Don't waste your time with Red Dead Online.;1;127,7;14/11/2021;741;8;;10.0

16;Action; 299,90;I've played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressive! And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law.;1;362,6;9/09/2021;847;11;;10.0

18;Action; 99,50;Lucid, Organic, and Raw.feel free to watch this review in video form<<< click meMax Payne 3 and its presentation make it one of the greatest shooters I have ever played. Many other first and third-person shooters come off feeling stiff and artificial, no matter how esteemed the Game or Gameplay. There comes the point where we, as players grow conscious, realise that we are indeed controlling hardened tough guys, protagonists who may or may not let the odd grunt slip out of their inanimate lips upon taking damage. Max Payne 3 has made me realise that our Gordon Freeman's and Master Chiefs all lack emotion. visual and verbal feedback informing the player that they control a person, a living human being. Not a bunch of code that lets us sit on the shoulders of our favourite video game protagonists. Games lack moments that humanise the characters on the screen, Moments that, if included in a Game's design, Story, and Gameplay, would help grow the assemblage of 1 and 0s that the developers are trying to sell to us into real people. Max Payne 3 has these moments, and that is what makes it great. The Game's presentation and Gameplay are a trip - Lucid, Organic, and Raw. Playing the Game feels like a dream, literally. Everything feels so real, is so real. Max's fluid animations blend seamlessly into one another, dynamically reacting to player input, making the Game feel authentic and visceral. I find it astonishing how gunplay remains smooth and intuitive despite being so heavily animated -  the shooting mechanics are some of the best I've seen to date. it's just so satisfying. Shooting someone isn't something that just happens - it's impactful. You won't see enemies merely rag-doll after being shot. they react to their injuries, clutching their wounds, squeezing their eyes shut with pursed lips. every death feels unique, with a weight that is felt. A life that Max and I have taken. Perhaps that's just the Game's masterful presentation talking as it imprints on my mind, adding depth and subtle details that may not be there at all. Admittedly levels feel claustrophobic, and the Game itself is exceptionally linear, with many areas and battle arenas feeling limited. It would've been nice to see more areas like the Nightclub and the Airport that offer more room to move around. however, the levels have benefited from this design choice and are extraordinarily detailed with incredible fidelity. That aside, Max is a man in pain. I got that much. However, you don't just see his pain in cut-scenes, but throughout the Gameplay. Many Games fail to convey how the protagonist feels during the most crucial part of any Game. the Gameplay. They abandon the emotion. it's only allowed for cut-scenes and dialogue, right? Wrong.Max doesn't walk. He pulls himself around, dragging his clunky feet, always moving nonchalantly - even when he leaps into the air, there's no grace to be seen. Max ends up falling to the floor like a pile of bricks - struggling, as he staggers back onto his feet. The youthful nature seen in previous instalments made you feel like Neo from the Matrix. Now, It's all gone.Max's movements. they're unhurried. he's tired, he's in pain. Max is now the one looking to buy more sand for his hourglass, or perhaps he's waiting for it to run out? He's hanging heavy, desperately hauling himself from altercation to altercation - shootout to shootout. Through his animations and mannerisms, you see all of this during Gameplay - the feeling of pain, a man whose entire being has shattered into billions of pieces. He's lost everything, and you don't just see this during a cut scene of Max drowning his soul in liquor. that depressing, painful tone is slathered all over the Game. That tone is why Max Payne 3 is my favourite out of the entire trilogy. Max Payne 3 has been one of the best gaming experiences I've had in some time. It's a Game I see myself replaying for its visceral nature, fluid animations and gunplay. Like many others, this Game is a sublime work of art—the story and storytelling - Max's character progression. Sadly, we won't see a Max Payne 4. it's a shame as I have not felt as invested in a character for a long time. James McCaffreys went above and beyond bringing this character to life. And goodness, the music - Health made sure this Game had a soundtrack I won't be forgetting anytime soon. As mentioned before, Lucid, Organic, and Raw are the three words I would use to describe this Game. It's engaging and surprisingly intimate. unequivocally one of the Best Games I've ever played.Rest easy, Max. Thank You,removedmaterial;1;15,0;28/12/2020;192;5;;10.0

19;Adventure; 99,50;This is hands down the best detective game I have played. I love the noire style, and all the characters are well thought out and well written. There are a few problems with the core mechanics of the game, but they do not get in the way of the story. If you get Widescreen Fixer to fix the 30fps cap, the game will run like butter. I've only encountered one game breaking bug with Widescreen Fixer and it was in an optional side mission, and you can always just toggle it off at that point in the game. Pros:-Great story-Fun gameplay-Good acting-Likeable, well written charactersCons:-30fps cap without Widescreen Fixer, and even that isn't a perfect solution-Some small, but noticable glitchesOverall: I definitely recommend this game, especially if you can pick it up on sale4/5;1;33,4;23/06/2017;219;5;;8.0

19;Adventure; 99,50;L.A. Noire is a detective game, simple as that. If you're looking for another shoot everything rampage game like GTA just because this game is made by Rockstar then this is not the game for you. Sure there is shooting, but you won't be allowed to kill everyone in sight, running people over will affect your case rating etc. The Atmosphere	  Personally, I love the setting of the game, the late 40s jazz theme mixed with golden age Hollywood as well as a classic noir feel makes for a great mix, but while the storytelling is good, it's not all there. The story feels a bit like it's jumping around without finishing everything off, Rockstar gathered enough story for a movie, but not a 20 hour game. Because of this you will be left with extra things that feel like they are just there to fill up an hour of your time and parts of the story that are never properly concluded. This being said, the story has some great parts towards the second half of the game and does a great job 80% of the time, however the ending will feel incomplete.  Gameplay and Fun	 It's fun to drive around and using your siren to move people out of the way is great. The car chases are exciting at first but end up being repetitive, as with all the chases. Shootouts feel this way too and there are one or two that will feel boring. The combat tends to feel stiff from time to time. For an open world game it is very linear and the free roam mode itself actually takes some working out to access. Street crimes are fun to attend to and interrogations are challeging. The clue finding in the game is brilliant and walking around the crime scenes never gets old although you will quickly work out the set structure to finding all the clues. Sound	 The sound in the game makes for great immersion, no complaints here really. The hint sounds at crime sounds can be turned off if they make the game too easy and the whole feel of the sirens and the radio really sells the 40s atmosphere. Graphics	 The facial expressions are the best part about the graphics, I didn't notice too many hiccups in the graphics and if I did they didn't distract from the game. The faces of people look incredibly lifelike and all the other graphics are good too. The sunny setting of Los Angeles adds a bright feeling to the game. Replayability	 While you do have the option to replay your cases to get all clues and perfect your interrogation this game is likely to be one you will only play the story of once, it's still fun to drive around and do street crimes but the cases tend to be something that's best as a one time thing. Verdict	 Overall this game is great fun and a nice step away from GTA while still keeping to the Rockstart format. It feels fresh but also familiar. The graphics look very good for a game that came out in 2011. You will feel very immersed in the time period through use of sound and surroundings. The open world side has something to be desired and Los Angeles doesn't exactly feel as alive as GTA 4's Liberty City or Watch Dog's Chicago, it doesn't have much of a personality, the characters do. If you're looking for a good open world game, this isn't it, if you're looking for a good story with a mix of puzzle and regular shoot/drive gameplay and well designed characters then this is it. Get this if: You like a good story You want diverse gameplay that makes you think You like the Noir settingDon't get this if: You want full freedom in an open world You want to go on a killing spree You don't care about story  8.5/10;1;20,5;2/11/2014;201;6;;8.0

20;RPG; 59,99;Greetings: My grandson talked me into trying Fallout 4. I'm an older player (65) who enjoys video games. I am very impressed with the game overall though I do wish I didn't have the CTD's and other issues with the game. But the ability to do the kind of building along with the post war setting has been a lot of fun. Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try. I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things. I do use quite a few mods and I'm sure the contributes to the CTD's etc in the game. I thing Bethsadia has done a great job presenting this game. I played the original Fallout many years ago. Having learned how to make video's of the gameplay and posting on youtube (mostly for my grandson to see my settlements) has been a nice side benefit of playing fallout. I would recommend the game and using mods...just do all you can to ensure things are loaded correctly.;1;2620,0;26/03/2017;768;35;;8.0
20;RPG; 59,99;I'll keep this short.If you want to play an excellent role-playing game where you can create a truly unique character and feel like your decisions have real consequences. Where every decision counts and you are constantly being presented with those decisions. Where factions, tribes and groups have a real impact and significantly affect the world.Play Fallout: New VegasIf you want to play an excellent looter-shooter with finely honed and extensive crafting systems that allow you to have full control over your customisation. Where you don't have to rely on VATS for shooting and weapons feel satisfying to fire/swing. Where power armour is true to its name and really is powerful but also realistic.Play Fallout 4These are two very different games and which one you should play is down to what you want to experience. Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best RPGs ever made but has terrible shooting mechanics and its looting systems are lacklustre. Fallout 4 has excellent mechanics and has one of the best looting and crafting systems in the RPG genre but its storytelling is rather linear and your choices are limited and often quite inconsequential.That's my two-penny's worth;1;183,4;23/10/2019;796;25;;8.0

20;RPG; 59,99;"Yeah, I've played it for a little bit.In all seriousness: this game has divided fan opinions, but in short: if you don't mind losing some roleplay aspects in exchange for more modern take on combat and a metric crapton of things to do, then I'd recommend this game for you. I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:The good:+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like  laser autoshotguns, plasma flamers or, say, an automatic long-range carbines - without breaking the game balance. The settlement system can be used to build anything from a small personal safehouse to full-sized towns with it's own stores and services.+ As mentioned before, there's a whole lot to do. The base game has plenty of side quests, and there are four possible factions you can side with - one of which allows you to spare two of the others if you so please. Each faction has it's own side missions, some of which can be repeated as many as times as you want in a new location. You can play multiple sides pretty far into the game, too, if you're undecided or want to collect several paychecks at once. There's also a new miscellaneous objectives system, which lets you keep track of minor tasks and clues you've come across.+ The game has a decent degree of unpredictability to it. Random encounters from Fallout 3 make a return, and most generic location-specific enemies have randomized equipment and loot every playthrough. Just about every enemy also has different stronger variants, which may replace ""regular"" enemies depending on the player level.+ The game looks and sounds really good. The graphics have been updated, but Bethesda also redid every animation from scratch. In general, almost everything from weapon animations to character movement feels natural and smooth. New Vegas had terrible voice acting for all but few characters, but luckily that mistake was not repeated in FO4: almost every character that talks has good or great voice acting (Deacon and Elder Maxson are good examples of the latter...but see the the first point of Mixed section). The soundtrack deserves a special mention, too: you can tell it has been done with love.+ For a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is surprisingly bug free. Of course, there's still a fair amount of them, but they tend to be visual/acoustic rather than crashing or game-breaking issues. I don't think I've had more than a few major cases during my playtime that I haven't caused myself with mods, which is pretty impressive considering how complex the game is.The bad:- The new dialogue system is definitely a step back from the last two games. You only have four dialogue choices every time, but the biggest problem is that each of them only have a brief description rather than the full line, which sometimes may be something else than you'd assume. You'll very likely want to fix the latter with mods.- The base story is somewhat lackluster. The new dialogue system severely restricts the amount of lore and background information that is conveyed to the player, so the underlying plot (particularly faction histories and motives) feels rather undetailed in the end. Other than that, the lack of lore is mostly fixed in form of notes and terminal entries, but it'd always be better to hear if from characters themselves.- Lip syncing doesn't seem to be Bethesda's strong suit. Guess that's the trade-off of having tens of thousands of voice lines in the game.- In contrast of the previous games, there are only a couple of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill checks in the game (aside from Charisma, of course). This feels like a huge unused potential, considering that in the previous games abilities like Intelligence and Perception allowed alternative approaches to many situations.The mixed:* The player character is voiced in Fallout 4. Both male and female voice actors tend to excel in sarcastic/humorous situations, but the rest is generally in the decent-enough category. Many would have preferred the silent protagonist, and I can see why.* Bethesda has made some retroactive changes into the canon - some good, some bad. For example, I personally love how power armor works in this game, but some other lore detail changes (which I will not spoil) seem to pointlessly contradict the previous games. Luckily, the bad retconning is limited to minor details only.* Creation Club. Like most of the world, I'm against paid mods, but fortunately you're by no means forced to buy anything. In fact, they seem to give out skins and other small stuff for free every week or two, so you can still reap some of the benefits without actually having to support the business practive whatsoever.In the end, I don't think I can give this game a rating that applies to everyone...so let me put it this way:If you prefer more in-depth roleplay, then you might be better off sticking to New Vegas and Fallout 3.If you don't mind that and the flaws listed above too much, then you'll probably find this game to be either 8 or 9 points out of 10. For what's it worth, I've certainly enjoyed it.";1;4695,1;10/10/2018;459;31;;8.0
20;RPG; 59,99;How to make Fallout 4 a decent ROLE-PLAYING gameYou might already know that Fallout 4 is a step backward from predecsessors when it comes to role-playing. So first download and install these mods: (Also note this is just my personal recommendation of mods)- Outcast and Remnants- Project Valkyrie- Fusion City (optional)- Depravity Evil Role Playing mod- Diary of a Madman- Start me Up (Alternate start mod)And that's it you're good to go. You can be whatever you want with these mods, you want to make peace with all factions? sure go ahead. You want to kill every factions and leaving with only you and your raider gangs to colonized the Commonwealth? sure go ahead.Another recommedation of mods that i personally use:- Real World Damages.     This mod will remove the bullet sponge throughout the game and can be really useful to   conserve ammo and your luggage. And also this mod will make you kill enemies easier, but  of course the NPC can also kill you by instantly, so neat right?- Full Dialog Interface.     Bring back dialog box options like in New Vegas.- Binary Speech Checks.     Makes the speech checks binary like in New Vegas.- Survival Options.     Bring back the quicksave or autosave options when playing the game on survival diificulty   mode. Because you don't know when the game would randomly crash right? this will   become a lifesaver.I already have 7th playthrough with this game and i will keep playing it from time to time.Now enjoy with your new fresh playhtrough Fallout 4.;1;844,4;12/11/2021;413;8;;8.0

21;RPG; 149,00;"Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment. worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream ""Fus Ro Dah!"", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. ""Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing.""I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!";1;1757,6;28/04/2022;604;327;;10.0
22;Action; 79,00;"Okay, as a 50+ year old gamer who's been playing since the 1970's I know my limits and I tend to stay away from ""twitch"" games where reaction times have to be razor sharp. With that in mind I avoided this game for a while, in spite of having enjoyed and finished every previous DOOM iteration from the beginning. When it went on a great sale I figured ""what the heck"" and decided to give it a try, thinking it might be a short-lived experiment. Boy was I wrong. The controls are intuitive and easy to master. The encounters are a blast and even failing is pretty fun as you figure out where you went wrong. I'm playing on the second level of difficulty and finding it challenging but just challenging enough to make it a lot more fun. The music and graphics are also excellent and add to the excitement.I do find that the best technique for surviving a difficult battle is to to just pace myself, taking bites out of the boss and avoiding going toe-to-toe with them as I run and jump around. I keep flaming and death punching the baddies to keep my armor and health up and I choose a weak one every now and then to chainsaw and get the ammo up. I can't really recommend this game enough. It's well balanced and exciting but not too overwhelming and it really rewards the creative use of weapons and using actual strategies. If you're old like me, don't be afraid and give it a go. You'll be glad you did.";1;38,7;15/08/2021;1465;23;;10.0

22;Action; 79,00;It's the raw cerebral intensity of Quake married with Doom's enemy roster and its violent, cathartic attitude. Enjoying this game requires a certain frame of mind, a certain willingness to push yourself and to think in the heat of the moment. But it's extremely rewarding if you meet it on its own terms. Nearly every weapon feels like it has a significant role, a stark contrast to Doom 2016's promotion of 2 weapon playstyles. Ammo counts have been massively reduced, pushing the player towards intelligent use of their loadout. Overall, the way I would describe this difference is that Doom 2016 treats its weapons as a set of toys, in which any can be used at any time without too much consequence. Doom Eternal treats them as tools, and you have to use them well to achieve success.The Doom Slayer is more mobile in every possible way and the combat is even more fast paced. Enemies are smarter, more aggressive and more varied across the board. New abilities like the blood punch, flame belch and ice grenade have been added, and provide even more tactical depth.The end result of all of this is a hyper-intense gameplay loop of constant movement, weapon swapping, and decision making. It makes you feel like a demon-slaying god when you finally overcome. It's extremely engaging to the point that I keep coming back even after like 4 playthroughs.All in all, from a gameplay standpoint it's one of the best SP FPS games ever, and a clear improvement over Doom 2016 in all of the ways that matter most. There's really not much else like this in the modern market. In an age in which arena shooters and movement based shooters are dying and the market is overwhelmingly shifting towards slower, less intense genres like tactical shooters and Battle Royales, it's nice to know that a game like this can still be made and find success. I'll get sappy for a second and say this: Thank you, id Software. You're the only AAA developer that still cares about the things I value in a shooter.;1;139,5;17/11/2020;645;12;;10.0

24;Action; 89,99;"Prey is something else.People tend to compare it to the older Bioshock (1&2) games, and they're not entirely wrong, but that's just what it looks like on the surface.Wrench? CheckMultiple superpowers that are found over the course of the game? CheckWeapons that can be upgraded to deepen your playstyle? CheckA game world that was once sprawling with life and is now mostly deserted? CheckGeneral horror aesthetic and fear of the unknown in a claustrophobic space? CheckIf you look at it like that, it might as well could be a spiritual successor of Bioshock, however, Arkane stepped above and beyond with this one.Arkane, who have already long proven their prowess for non-linear level design with Dishonored 1&2 have outdone themselves with Prey.See that security station? There's these juicy Neuromods (skillpoints) inside, but you don't have the right code.Well, here is where Arkane Studios truly shines.To list some of the possiibilities to enter the station:- find out who worked in this station, track them using another computer, find them (or more likely, their corpse), get the keycode. - Hack the console to force the door open- Use the ""Gloo Gun"" (This thing is just nuts, the best gadget I have seen in my years of playing videogames) to build a staircase up the security station and enter from the vent- See this small gap in the (bulletproof) window? Put a mug or an apple or something small next to it, turn into that Apple (because Mimicry) and roll through like you own the place, then morph back. - The security console can be seen from the gap in the window, right? Might as well shoot the buttons on it with your trusty *Huntress Boltcaster*™ which has foam darts to deactivate the security lock.Get those Neuromods, invest them in a higher hacking skill, so next time you encounter a door such as this, you have one more skill in your repertoire. You see, on the surface, it's Bioshock, but below, it's just so much deeper in almost every regard.The best part is, you're never truly restricted.The Talos-1, the huge research space ship this game takes place on, is built like a metroidvania in many regards, which I absolutely adore.Sometimes you find a new gadget, receive a new superpower, unlock a new skill, and you're like hooool' up, can I now enter X place? So you go back, and you can. And you find new ♥♥♥♥, you find new logs, which point you towards a new direction on your self-bestowed quest to finally understand what exactly happened on the Talos-1.The combat in this game takes a similar approach as the security station described above.See these mimics? Well, they're not aware of you yet, they haven't morphed. If you trigger them, they will rush you and you will take damage, so let's play this smart.- Pew Pew them with your gun until they explode?- Throw an item next to a gas pipeline, shoot the gas, watch them burn?- Gloo™ them until they're glued in place, then take your sweet time throwing random items such as microscopes, wastebins, and any other thing that's not nailed down at them?- Sneak past them altogether? There seem to be some vents nearby, wonder where they lead?- Remember that automated turret you saw a few minutes ago? Wonder what'll do to them when you deploy it and just open the door.The possibilties are endless, and I truly hope that this game one day will receive the praise it really deserves.It feels like Bethesda threw money and the name ""Prey"" at Arkane and said ""go nuts"", and that's what they did.I really don't want to go into more detail than this, but know that for the low price of whatever you're gonna pay for this, you will get your moneys' worth.Here's to hoping that DEATHLOOP can top this absolute gem.";1;56,1;2/08/2021;193;1;;10.0

The setting of this game is so well realized and crafted in a way to feel like a real, tangible place.

We will never get another game like this again, unfortunately. This game got swept under the rug by the ""open world craze"" from the x1/ps4 gen and it didnt perform the way it needed to.. The studio lost 75% of staff with redfall. People like to say the game's title was the core of the issue which is retarded. The IP was completely irrelevant at the time.

It is more like an additional simulation game and does not contribute to the main game's story, nor does it play like the main game. It's made for hardcore PREY fans to kill time and additional content for them.;1;99,8;21/06/2018;394;21;;10.0
24;Action; 89,99;"Prey.The mind game.IntroductionAfter finishing Prey and returning to the title screen, the first words that came out of my mouth were: ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ incredible."" Many liken Prey to other FPS's as having copied their ideas, whether they be Bioshock, Deus Ex, or Half-Life. however I feel that Prey's mixture of its peers' concepts and its own nuances distinguishes itself in a tangible way. Most games, especially FPS's, impress in some regards but fail in others. By contrast, Prey exceeds all of its qualifying marks, reflecting a commitment to craftsmanship rare in modern gaming.PlotIt's hard to talk story specifics without spoiling, but here's some background on the game. Prey exists in an alternate timeline, where JFK's assassination attempt failed, and the US and Soviet Union eventually worked together on the space race. Fast forward to the year 2035, after a formerly Soviet space station named Kletka had been purchased, repurposed, and privatized by Transtar Industries. Kletka was retitled Talos I, and became a testing ground for Transtar's neuromod technology. Neuromods rewire pathways in the brain, granting new skills and fantastical powers. You play as the male or female VP of Transtar, Morgan Yu... an amnesiac and one of the stations few remaining survivors.PresentationChanging focus, Prey is a game that looks great, but could be better. All graphical details and visual effects are near photo-realistic, but that doesn't bear out to an interesting art style in this case. I'm being unfair to an extent, but I do expect a triple-A game from 2017 to be moderately more aesthetically pleasing than plain realism. On the other hand, I'm in love with Prey's masterpiece of an OST. as it's comprised of ominous, retro, synth heavy, and emotive tracks that fit flawlessly in place. Every element of the soundscape is impeccable, and builds up the atmosphere. Prey performs proficiently too. I had no crashes or bugs in my 28 hour playthrough. Altogether, the game displays itself with near-flying colors.Level DesignOne of Prey's key strengths is its setting and level structure. The Talos I is inherently macabre, as the towering, stark architecture in the depths of space is made further daunting by the corpses littering its atriums, corridors, and work spaces. The station is superbly designed from a gameplay perspective as well, as there are several paths toward objectives and different ways to use the environments to your advantage. This includes a liberating level of verticality, which switches up the tactile pacing and gets you to search for hidden spots all around Talos I. Every section of the ship is open to free-form exploration too, after you acquire access to them. In this sense, Prey certainly mirrors the philosophy of Deus Ex, and straddles the line of being an action-RPG.Gameplay Mechanics & DesignSpeaking of action, the gameplay of Prey is unbelievably smooth, challenging, and hectically enjoyable. The melee and gun combat is flashy and brutally satisfying, with meaty animations and sound effects. There are a variety of methods to deal damage to your enemies, which can be mixed and matched to produce elaborate combat styles. Stealth is another viable option, which functions just as well as you’d expect considering Prey is from the people who made Dishonored. What Yu can do is only half the fun though. Your adversaries are just as creative in combat as you are. Mimics are Prey's most recognizable creature. they're the aliens that turn into objects and then unexpectedly assault you before you can even react. There are at least a half dozen more enemy types, each of which require divergent tactics to eliminate. That's where neuromods, the psychoscope, and chipsets come in.Progression SystemNeuromods are basically Prey's leveling system, as using them gives access to perks and new powers. This starts at increasing your health pool, weapon damage, movement speed, etc.. but branches out into much more kick-@ss abilities once you unlock Typhon powers. The alien species that infected Talos I are known as Typhon's, and after you find the psychoscope, you can scan them (a la Bioshock) and use neuromods to gain their unique attributes. These skills range from turning into small objects like mimics, to summoning columns of fire to make a nice Typhon char-burger. Chipsets are comparatively tame, and simply modify the spacesuit and psychoscope to have extra functions in their own right.Gameplay FreedomThe mechanics don't end there though, as repair, hacking, and crafting perks support the gameplay experience too. These systems are frequently used to gain access to crucial resources, which are always in short supply. Putting all of these features together. the multifaceted level design, combat tactics, neuromod abilities, Typhon powers, item management, and brilliant enemy AI. results in an unavoidably taxing, inventive, and addictive gameplay loop. The player's freedom to truly make the gameplay their own with these mechanics is what takes the cake in the end. For me, this puts Prey up there with other classic FPS's, such as Half-Life and Deus Ex.Main Story & CharactersFinally getting back to the major storyline, it's a real doozy. Prey puts copious decisions in front of you throughout your playtime, usually to do with how you treat the small cast of main characters and other survivors aboard Talos I. These personas are seen sparingly, but are each intrinsically valuable to the narrative. They're also believable as people, who prod you into caring about their lives, and the predicaments they're in. Shades of gray pervade every available choice though, little is ever presented as solely right or wrong. This culminates at an astonishing finale, one which made so much sense and judged you by your actions, and yet was also so overwhelmingly surreal. Outside of the central story are side tales too. often leading to side quests.Side Quests & LoreWhile traversing the ship, surrounded by bodies, you'll come across a number of audio logs and emails mislaid by the dead crew. Listening to and reading their final thoughts do wonders toward bringing the world and story to life, in a relatably human way. These final thoughts provide side objectives as well, which make the game feel less linear - and once again - more like an action-RPG. The two critiques I have of them is that the ancillary quests require far too much backtracking, and about a quarter of them feel like filler that don't carry any real weight in terms of gameplay or narrative. They're assuredly a positive addition to Prey though, just a bit rushed.ConclusionI've resolved to hold out on talking any more about the story, as Prey is a game that thrives on surprising the player, as much as it thrives on decision-making. While I've explained my scant irritations with the game, I hope my great amount of praise for it speaks much louder. Prey absolutely went above and beyond my expectations, and is now one of my favorite games of all time. The terrific gameplay and fascinating narrative made sure of that. A supreme quantity of variability in combat and writing guarantees multiple worthwhile replays too. An experience that is wholly singular is what Prey offers, and it's one I'd recommend to any, and every gamer.Personal Rating: 9.5/10 - Categorically Phenomenal";1;30,6;23/07/2018;240;4;;10.0

Almost anything you see in a given place can be picked up and interacted with.+Complex, Intriguing storyline. adapts a meticulous ""show, don't tell"" narrative approach.+Replay incentives come in form of multiple endings and preferred skill builds.+PC Version is well optimised. unlike Dishonored 2. The controls and UI feel like they were made with KB/M in mind. CONS:  -Heavy backtracking may off some, especially in the last moments of the game.-Same goes for clunky gunplay, which is intentional design.-Players going for a stealth build will suffer in the long run since both stealth perks and mechanics are basic. VERDICT: Inspite of some glaring issues, Prey is one of the best PC titles since ages. Everything about it screams classic PC titles, from the System shock like aesthetics to the user interface. and it feels fresh to see devs who aren't pulling their punches or empowering the player with little effort.Prey belongs to the breed of thinking-man shooters which we don't see getting made nowadays, it's definitely a niche title.It not just demands player intelligence, it expects it.That said, Prey is NOT everyone's cup of tea. Some may get hooked right off the bat while some may uninstall after a few minutes with the game. But from my end, it's a BUY for whoever can accept it's weirdness and challenge.";1;59,1;8/05/2017;450;14;;8.0
24;Action; 89,99;Finally finished it .. and man what a ride! :hee: definitly game of the year 2017 for me. - Solid and diverse gameplay (Nuromods open to a lot of strategies on how to finish your opponents, swtiching between weapons also!)- freedom of choice - big station, lot to discover- interesting story that motivate you to keep going till the end- some fun side-quests The only downside for me is that i wish the game was a bit more longer and had large boss fights lol (espacially since i had such a huge arsenal of grenades of all kinds, 50+ medkits, weapons, large amount of Ammo, i was ready for WAR man!) but ..really 50h is great value!.

(OPTIONAL) Play Multiplayer DLC Comrades with friends.Why:The order I've given above is not in chronological order of events, Rather, the order I've given is a recommended approach to familiarize yourself with the characters and lore and gain a deeper appreciation for the main cast at each step. During the main game, read the character biographies in the Archives (found in the in-game menu). It sometimes explains things that happened off-screen, and is updated when significant events happen in the game.I will now explain in detail why I recommend the order above. Each of the following numbered points corresponds to the same numbered point above:1. If you're undecided about whether you should buy the game, the Demo gives you all of Chapter 1, which is a good opportunity for you to try the game's mechanics and decide if they are to your taste (especially the combat). If you've already bought the game, Chapter 1 is for you to get to know the main cast as they are ""now"". The supplementary material (the Brotherhood anime and the Prologue novella) will delve into their backstories a bit more. This means of course that the supplementary material actually takes place before Chapter 1, but I recommend playing Chapter 1 first - kind of like how in real life you meet people and get to know them as they are, and then once you've known them for a while, then you start to learn more about their past and their history2. This takes place before Chapter 1 and ends some time after Chapter 1. Noctis and his buddies are barely in the movie, but the movie sets up the world and lore - why Noctis and his buddies are doing what they're doing at the start of Chapter 1, and what's going on in their home city Insomnia while they're away. Pay attention to King Regis' motivations (try to empathize with him). In the movie's prologue, the white-haired boy is Ravus (he'll show up in the 2nd half of the game) and the girl is Lunafreya (Noctis' bride-to-be). If you can form an emotional connection with Lunafreya over the course of the movie, it will improve the emotional stakes of the game. The movie focuses on Nyx's point of view, but really the people you want to pay attention to (for the game's sake) is King Regis and Lunafreya. Also side note: Clarus (the shaven-head guy who's with King Regis) is Gladiolus' dad3. The real plot of the game starts here. At the start of the chapter you seek out Cor from the Crownsguard. Note that the Crownsguard is different from the Kingsglaive featured in the Kingsglaive movie. I initially confused this character with the leader of the Kingsglaive in the movie until I googled it4. The anime's ""present"" takes place while you're on your road trip around doing the tasks that you're told to do in Chapter 2, so this is a good time to watch it. The backstory of what happened to Noctis is a good way for you to understand why  Noctis is so broody. It's easier to empathize with him once you know the trauma he experienced as a child. Also, the little girl Iris in Episode 3 is Gladiolus' little sister and she shows up in the game.5. This takes place the day before Noctis and friends eave Insomnia to embark on their roadtrip. It ends right as they're going to the Citadel to meet King Regis (the opening scene of the game). I liked how it developed Noctis and Ignis' relationship a bit more, especially when Ignis recalls how Noctis' injury changed him. I presume this is the injury from the daemon in the Brotherhood anime. I believe that same injury is the one Noctis was still recovering from in the prologue of the Kingsglaive movie. This might help you understand Lunafreya's special place in Noctis' heart. At just 8 years old Noctis witnessed the death of his caretaker at the hands of a daemon and is himself injured. Presumably he is still recovering from this injury when he meets Lunafreya as a child in Tenebrae, which Noctis constantly has flashbacks to in the game. To meet someone so pure and loving like Lunafreya not long after his dark, traumatic experience with the daemon must have left a strong impression on him, building a strong emotional attachment for him to Lunafreya.6. Have fun. You might have heard that the sidequests are really unabashedly bad and of no consequence to the world/plot (unlike games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3). It's quite a shame because it's a such a missed opportunity, given how beautiful the Open World is to roam about in. SquareEnix probably just ran out of time or resources, and admittedly churning out well-written side-quests is probably the least of the concerns given the long development hell the game went through. Nevertheless, just take the sidequests and hunts as excuses for you to spend time with Noctis and his buddies. The more you develop an attachment to the 4 of them, the better the emotional payoff towards the end of the game and in the DLC.7. This DLC is about Gladiolus trying to get stronger so he can better protect Noctis. Not really much story development, but the combat is more skill-based and probably an interesting experiment on SquareEnix's part. If you like Gladioulus' combat style, you can unlock the ability to play him in the main game by spending AP in the main game's Ascension menu (it's under the Techniques tab). You can do this even before you play the DLC actually, but the DLC trains you better. If you finish the DLC it unlocks a new weapon (both Gladiolus and Noctis can use it) and ability for Gladiolus that carries over to the main game.8. The Open World is about to close off lore-wise soon. You can still play the Open World segment in the later chapters, but it's not lore-friendly because Noctis and his buddies are about to embark on a journey that leaves behind the Open World. You access the Open World through pretty much a game mechanic later on. I spent over 70 hours on the Open World before I finally moved on in Chapter 9. Think of it as time for you to develop your love for the main characters. The emotional impact of the linear Chapters 9-14 depend on this9. (See previous point)10. Enjoy the story!11.

25;RPG; 125,00;"UPDATE: Finished everything in the game.Excellent port!Configuration tips:1) Turning off all NVIDIA extra graphics settings improves FPS by a ton. Hairworks is the most lightweight one though (costs about 2fps) and looks amazing so I kept that one on.2) The High-Resolution Pack works great on a GTX 1070 (on 1440p res), even though it lists minimum requirements as being a GTX 1080 Ti, and I recommend you get it if you run a resolution greater than 1080p, have a GPU with 8GBs of VRAM, and have the extra 65GBs of space for it.3) If you have performance issues remember to update your drivers. Both Nvidia and AMD have new drivers that include optimization for this game.4) IMPORTANT EDIT: I originally had a guide here on how to edit the .ini file to support a 144hz monitor. After playing a little longer I noticed some bugs I was having such as long black screens before loading and hunt posters staying on screen after turning the quests in. Turns out this was due to editing the .ini file. Please reset your .ini file if you are having issues after editing it from my guide or another. Edits other than framerate can cause similar issues too. I recommend leaving the file alone for now.5) The options you get when booting up the game ""Television"" or ""Home Theater"" don't affect your display, they actually affect your audio. It also had nothing to do with stereo or surround sound. It determines audio compression. If you are using low quality speakers select ""Television"" as it will sound better for you. Otherwise choose ""Home Theater"".Note: I know many are reporting random CTDs or frame drops but I haven't experienced a single CTD and the game runs smooth as butter for me staying between 50-60 fps even when encountering large enemies (i7-4790k, GTX 1070, 16GB 2133 DDR3 RAM, SSD).Game Review:PC Support - 9/10Performance - 9/10Graphics - 9/10Sound - 8/10Music - 8/10Story - 9/10Gameplay - 7/10Multiplayer - 4/10 (mostly dead by the time I got to it)Things I like:Story was great and the main crew are some of the most unforgettable characters in gaming.The setting is a mix of high fantasy and steampunk but where some characters just look like normal people driving cars and stuff.The summons and giant creatures you sometimes encounter are epic. Imagine fighting a boss the size of a mountain... so big the camera doesn't even function correctly.You're driving a luxury vehicle that transforms several times throughout the game.Whole game is very stylish.Things I don't like:The story won't hit like it should unless you experience the other accompanying FFXV media first such as Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV and Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV. While not as important it might even be worth it to play A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV and watch the Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV on YouTube.Episode Ardyn isn't included in this edition and it's the best DLC content.Side quests are some of the most boring unmemorable side content I've played through, reminds me of MMO fetch quests with no real story involved. I recommend skipping them even if you are a completionist.The high level challenge dungeons are just seemingly endless copy and paste floors of enemies, don't bother with these either.Unlike others I don't have a problem with the combat, I have a problem with the difficulty. The game is way too easy since you can just buy and carry ridiculous amounts of healing items. I later found out there is an easy mode but not hard mode which is just absurd. Definitely play with the hard mode mod from the Nexus even if it's your first time playing.The brainless minigame ""Justice Monsters Five"" is way too easy and therefore way too long and boring however if you play it long enough you can get some great items from it at the beginning of the game.";1;132,0;7/03/2018;509;11;;8.0

25;RPG; 125,00;"Spoiler-free review:[DISCLAIMER]I do vaguely critique on the story's development. If you wish to dive into the game without knowing any sort of pacing-related topics in terms of the game's story, do not read ahead. or just skip the next paragraph. However, I do not give out any specific spoilers, so rest assure.[STORY]Now, after beating the main story for myself, I will say one very important thing about the pacing of the story: the chapters feel very rushed toward the end, and it felt like each few sections of chapters within the game were developed, or written, by different people, Not to mention the numerous plot holes that were in each chapter, especially towards the end of the game. It goes from semi-dynamic gameplay to dynamic, and then to linear, which is absolutely disappointing. During the dynamic portion of the game, you can start and finish many side-quests, dungeons, or just power level via fighting monsters and bosses. Then, when you decide to progress through the story, about three-fourths of the way through progression, the game just decides to throw you into a linear structure of gameplay, which you will notice after about five minutes of playing through it. To conclude the topic of the game's story, let me say that it started it out pretty well, then escalated into something worse, but manageable if you don't think too critically about the plot holes, or why they developers decided to do what they did.Nonetheless, I still loved the characters, especially the main four and their small interactions during the open-world sequences.[DLC]So, at long last, I have finished all three DLC's. My experiences with Episode Gladiolus and Prompto differ from Episode Ignis. I didn't dislike any of the DLC's. however, I thoroughly enjoyed Episode Ignis a lot more not just because of the better combat mechanics, but because the story from the full-game is actually redeemed in a way through playing this DLC. The way they handled this DLC was pretty genius, and if you play through it, you might think the same. I can't say why exactly without giving out spoilers, so I'll stop talking about Ep. Ignis here. Each time the three DLC's were released, they got better and better. Episode Glad was a bit weak in terms of content, but explained what happened during a certain part of the main-game's story. Episode Prompto was very good in developing Prompto's character, but was weak in gameplay. There were moments during combat where I was getting a bit frustrated with how weak I was against the enemies. The mechanics were cool, but it felt like I was playing a third-person shooter made by Ubisoft.My overall thoughts on all three DLC's: They were very good in terms of story and character development. some could use tweaking in gameplay mechanics. and beating each DLC can give you extra items/weapons/fashion in the main game which is a plus. Although they felt weak at times, I liked all three of the DLC's. I believe they added onto the main game's story plot points quite a bit, which makes them more than worth playing.[GAMEPLAY]{Played this game with a Playstation 3 controller}I will try to keep this short and start off by saying that the gameplay is amazing! No, the combat is not turn-based, although you can enable the ""Wait"" combat function in the options at any time, which gives you a slight feel of the combat being turn-based. I decided to play without it, and I had a blast. My only gripe about the combat is that you can't freely use magic. You have to create it by absorbing three types of elements: electricity, fire, and ice. With these three, you can create a spell, which usually comes in a stock of x3 or x4. Furthermore, you can add a fourth item from your inventory which gives the spell more potency and effects. It's not so bad once you get used to it, but I still do wish you can use White Magick or Black Magick like in the older games. [VISUALS]Another disclaimer: This is a budget gaming PC I created in 2015. so yes, it is on the low-mid end tier. CPU: Intel i5-3570k (3.4ghz, NOT OC'd)GPU: Gigabyte GTX 960 2GBRAM: 8 GB DDR3DISK: Game installed on Samsung 850 EVO SSD 250 GBOS: Windows 7 64-BitOkay, so after testing various graphics settings via playing the demo before the full-game release, I ended up playing the majority of the full-game in the ""High"" setting with the scaling set to 100%. As many of you would expect with my specs, I did end up with a few problems here and there. After beating certain parts of the main story, I would end up running into a cutscene with about 10-20 frames running, even after the cutscene ended. So, I would be playing at the said frames unless I restarted my game. The same problem would sometimes happen after I perform a summon. Because of this, towards the end of the game, I switched to the ""Average"" graphics setting and I was mostly fine from there. There was one immersion-breaking moment that happened in a certain cutscene during the final hour or two of the game, where Noctis was invisible, but it was a rather short and less-important cutscene, so I was okay with it.On the ""Average"" settings, I was getting about 45-60 frames with a few dips here and there, but I did end up beating the game without the frames ever being locked to 30. So here's a tip from me: play this game with a graphics card with more VRAM than me. or just have a better machine than mine, which I'm sure is the case for many of you. I just thought I would add this section for the few that have rigs similar to mine. Final note, don't enable the last four ""NVIDIA"" graphics settings because those destroy your frames, even if you have an a slightly better setup than mine.[LOADING SCREENS]Okay. So, If you've played this game on a console after the initial release in 2016, you know how excruciatingly long the loading screens were. If you install this game on a standard HDD, you will get the same effects. However, if you install on an SSD, the longest you will have to wait is about 30 seconds. The average time it took for me to sit through the load screens was about 3 to 15 seconds. That's it.So try to install on an SSD if you have one. I moved a few of my steam games over to my 4TB HDD, just to install this and it was worth it. [As of 03/10/2018] On my end, this game is about 83.3 GB's, so maybe use that as reference to find some space.[VOICE ACTING]I don't mean to start a war over ""Sub vs. Dub"". I appreciate both languages.As a Japanese-American who fluently speaks and comprehends both the English and Japanese language, I played the entire game in Japanese, with English subtitles. Thank you Square Enix for adding that function to almost all of your newer games! I have watched a few Twitch streamers and YouTubers play the game in English, and I have to say both are very good. However, there were very key differences in the acting. Once again, let me state that I am not being biased because I'm Japanese. I believe I have a pretty good understanding of the level voice acting displayed on both sides of the spectrum. Now, my thoughts are that some of the characters' voices in English are a bit jarring at times. Since writing some of my specific critiques on the voices would end up riling some of you, I will avoid in doing so. However, I will say that the Japanese voices fit perfectly, and I had no problems at all.It was interesting, though, to hear Cindy talk in Japanese. In English, she has that southern accent, but in Japanese, she just speaks using standard Tokyo dialect. No complaints though. Also, the localization of this game made it so the subtitles are following the English voices, not Japanese. So if you play with Japanese voices, know that not all dialogue is the literal translations. Steam's character limit is preventing me from so much more explanation, unfortunately. Sorry.Edit [03/20/18]:- Added review of the DLC's- Cleaned up and fixed points in review- Removed review's ""Conclusion""";1;122,1;10/03/2018;268;8;;2.0
25;RPG; 125,00;FFXV is such a paradox. On one hand, it is such a flawed game. flawed in its core fundamentals - empty open world, middling and slightly repetitive side quests, weak narrative structure (can i just say, i adore the FFXV lore? why is it not in the game???). but somehow, all these things become bearable because i have the company of 3 extremely lovable, adorable, and memorable companions/party members. i will slog through endless walking in a barren field to kill 5 enemies because i want to hear noctis mistake prompto for ignis during their linkstrikes. i'll drive (also known as the most boring way to traverse an open world i've ever known) just to do prompto's lil photo spot side quests. i'll cook in campsites so gladio can have his cup noodles. YOU GET IT. the 4 main characters make the game shine, and if i'm being honest - hold every flimsy mechanic together. so, be prepared to cry your eyes out whenever you hear stand by me after beating this game because for fk's sake, it's been 5 years and i know i sure do get teary eyed when that song plays.;1;79,4;28/06/2023;171;3;;8.0
25;RPG; 125,00;This is a tragic game.  There are signs that this was supposed to be the greatest game ever.  If I showed you cutscenes and gameplay, you'd think they look spectacular.If I described armigar, warp strikes, chain strikes, etc, you'd think it sounded intense.If I told you the bullet points of the story, you would think it sounded intriguing.  It was going to gather together numerous elements of the entire final fantasy series into one complete and spectacular legend.Something went wrong, maybe it didn't get finished.  Pieces got sewed together.  There is no flow, no pace, no bridging any of it together.  Massive plot points are simply mentioned.  Gameplay gets tiresome as you just wail on enemies and getting higher powered just means it takes 20 seconds to kill a bad guy instead of 40.  It's fine for RPG combat, but it's not fun enough to carry exploration and other content.  Speaking of which, optional content is the worst part.  HOURS and hours of this game can be described as fetch quest 1-10, picture quest 1-10, animal gathering 1-10, Hunt monsters for gil etc.  Minimal dialogue, no development, and no point except money and wasting time and making you wonder what you are doing with your life.  You need an RPG to have character development, interesting plot, interesting themes, suprises, warmth and heart.  The sidequests are empty and frustrating.  It's probably wise to leave them when you have had enough.  However, every once in a while during the main story you are whisked away for a few moments and forget how bad it was for the hours wasted in between cutscenes.  Sometimes it feels totally worth it.  Some additional thoughts:  I watched Kingsglaive and the brotherhood miniseries before playing, and they went a long way to helping me enjoy the game.  Watching them all before playing any of the game wasn't confusing.   Playing the game in english means that your buddies will say dorky things, maybe playing in japanese can insulate you from that (assuming you can't tell the difference between dorky and cool japanese) The game in its current form is about a C+, I'm glad I played it.  I just regret that I never get to play the game it was supposed to be.;1;170,5;21/09/2018;358;8;;2.0

26;Action;00,00;"Well, here I am, just finished the game.I'll be honest with you, I was really looking forward to this game, and whilst I did most certainly enjoy it, im still disappointed. Im going to start this review with the negatives, and end on a more happy note.Though the game length isn't short, took me about 20 hours to complete around 75%, it still feels a lot shorter than Rise of the Tomb Raider. I can't really explain why, but I found myself quite suprised as to how fast the story was progressing.Speaking of the story, I hate to say it, but it's really quite bad. All the characters are pretty much bland and without any character or personality (with the exception of Lara and Jonah). I guarantee you you won't care about anyone else. Also the story just really lacks depth, I didnt get invested in it, at any point.Then we get to another really weird issue. The dialogue. Whilst the quality of the audio is excellent, I can't help but notice quest givers pause a lot longer inbetween sentences than what I would declare a normal way of speaking. It get's really bad when you are sitting at camp when Lara is narrating, sometimes she pauses like 5 seconds before saying anything. Literally half the time I think shes done talking and then suddenly theres more. It's just weird and feels unnatural.Then we get to the gameplay, first of all, I find there to be a lack of enemies. Sure you do fight quite regularly, whether it's stealth or combat, but, I just ended the game feeling like I hadn't really done much in the way of combat. In the trailers you see this cool scene in a dark jungle where Lara is taking out some soldiers, whilst this is in the game, its literally one quick sequence where you have no weapons, just a knife. There is stealth in the rest of the game of course, but I was hoping there were more areas like the one I just mentioned, instead of one litte sequence. Then we get to the ""hubs"". Do you feel like talking to everyone? I most certainly didn't because of the bad story, so good luck with that. I literally walked past most random civilian dialogue people simply muttering the phrase ""I dont give a sh*t"". Sure it gives you information about secrets and possible tomb locations, but as I said, I just didnt care.Then theres another issue: You will be locked from selecting certain outfits and using certain weapons for a big portion of the game. Now don't get me wrong, I understand the reasoning behind this, it's to ""blend in"", but I just found it really , really annoying. To end on a more positive note:The tombs are excellent.The new climbing mechanics work wellThe graphics are amazing.Excellent voice acting for Lara and JonahStealth is just as good as it was, though really easy due to bad AI.To sum up, if you liked Rise of the Tomb Raider, you will like this, BUT, you will feel it is inferior.I do recommend this game, but I would wait for a sale, especially if you loved Rise of the Tomb Raider.Seeing as though this is the last game in the trilogy, I do want it said that I really do hope they make more of these games, they are a joy to play.";1;48,2;19/09/2018;438;8;;4.0

26;Action;00,00;"MY REVIEW OF THE SHADOW OF THE TOMB RAIDER GAME  In South America  The most significant difference that always characterised each Tomb Raider episode: the change of location. My preference is with the colder climate (this also means that this episode omits the Endurance mode) but it is always nice to see how a new location can affect gameplay. Areas with battle now allow Lara to go back into hiding by bathing in mud. An interesting concept - I particularly liked how she could move along the wall out of plain sight due to the overgrown flora.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NN7UCIAHsQ&t=17s  Trinity  The bad guys return and Lara now encounters a leader called Pedro Dominguez. It is nice to add a face to Trinity this time and Pedro actually knows more of Lara than she thinks. Cutscenes are amazing with the usual high-quality voice acting on everybody's part and there is increased focus on Lara's childhood and father this time. There are a couple of twists here an there - as usual later on a new form of enemy appears to make the story more exciting. This alone does not make the plot totally different so the creators decided to include more peril by choosing artifacts with great power. Let's just say that Lara's race against Trinity has time factored in.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwljTbmEjvw&t=4s  Gameplay  You know how the developers add new elements even when it is not necessary. Gameplay in the previous two instalments was fast and dynamic enough. Still, there's new gear, of course. Overhang climbing is now possible with the use of special boots. I think this feature was unnecessary and thank god no puzzles were based on this. Grappling down from cliffs, however, is a nice new addition. We find all sorts of materials - beside upgrading our weapons we can craft pieces of clothing. Upper and lower body pieces are available but we can also acquire full body outfits. These add bonuses so getting dressed before a fight we can decide if we intend to aim for a more stealthy approach or go full guns blazing by putting on something that gives Lara health regeneration. And, naturally, we can give Lara the ""old"" look by applying skins from previous games (this is a purely cosmetic choice here).Other than these small changes or additional stuff gameplay mechanics remain the same. I liked the inclusion of air pockets during underwater sequences which made it possible to increase the time spent in such areas. Once again Lara can decipher various monuments (her language skills increase gradually) and there are tons of relics and letters to be found out there. You'll return to previous locations by using the camp system several times just to get that 100% completion.Graphics appear to be enhanced once again. I cannot comment on the latest RTX technology but everything else looked stunning as usual. Two more small adjustments done to walkthroughs: there are difficulty settings we can choose from but they are broken down into various elements we can adjust separately. Additionally, there is a possibility to make immersion better by allowing the NPCs to use their native language instead of English.  Longevity  What else to say about Shadow of Tomb Raider? Another great entry in the series where there are more and much bigger tombs. The DLCs also focus on these extra challenges. The hub area we visit appears to be greater and there are many side missions to complete. It's worth investing time into these as getting the rewards will make Lara stronger. There is a New Game+ mode available with additional skills we can purchase only during this second walkthrough.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdEfROL2Wx8&t=340s  I had fun with the latest instalment. The puzzles were sometimes annoying (oh boy the one in the church was just awful!) but gave me a good challenge, nonetheless. Of all 3 episodes this one has the most interesting story and definitely the most satisfying end game boss battle.";1;219,3;23/06/2022;132;21;;8.0
26;Action;00,00;"TL:DR if you expect a lot of combat from this game, do not buy it. If you want decent puzzles, stealth based action scenes or you are a Tomb Raider fan -old or new- in general, go for it. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is not a perfect game, it has its flaws -to some A LOT of them- but I believe it depends on what you expect from this game. As an old Tomb Raider fan, I expected puzzles that were not solvable in the very first minute, a strong Lara depiction and a little bit of action to add some spice to the game. I got what I wanted, but certainly there are some features I thought that could've been a lot better. - Skill system is pretty much useless in this game. If you played the previous games, you will recognize most of the skills that are present in Shadow. Those skills worked fine in 2013 and Rise because there were a lot of combat moments in them, but in Shadow there aren't a lot of combat. So weapon crafting and upgrading is pretty useless as well. Sometimes you won't even have your weapons other than your bow to fight the enemies anyway, sometimes you are forced to kill enemies only with your knife. -The game had many ads saying that you were going to be in the Amazon jungle this time, dealing with predators and wild life, but there aren't a lot of moments like that either. Only a few jaguars, piranhas and eels and that's pretty much the wild life you're going to witness. I expected more since Amazon was called the Green Hell by the conquistadors.-  It's a bit shorter than the previous games. The story is decent, it's not mind blowing nor lame. There are some moments you can see them coming from a mile away, but I thought it was interesting to deal with Trinity once again. Although I feel Lara has not become THE Lara we know, it's still nice to see her questioning her environment -even if she destroys or takes most of the artifacts she finds in her raidings lol - If you like parkouring, then you will love this game. Especially with the new difficulty settings, you can set the exploration difficulty on whatever suits you. - More swimming. I think this lacked in the previous games, so it was nice to have some underwater areas you can explore, be careful with the piranhas though.- There are more crypts and optional tombs in Shadow, and some of them are GREAT. Most of them have great atmosphere where you truly feel you are in a place that has been hidden and no man has set foot on the ground for a very long time. - I'm not even mentioning the graphics, the game looks pretty neat. It needs a bit more optimization as of October 2nd, but still it's a feast for the eyes.- This may not be important to many, but when I play games that are based on historical facts, then I want them to be researched thoroughly so they will be accurate. Sadly that is not the case here, you are going to see a lot of Mayan symbols in Incan tombs. The story tries to fix this mistake, but it's not doing a very believable job. Even the artifacts you find here and there, they have wrong information written about them. You can say ""this is a game, not a history lesson"" and that's fair ^_^ I just think if you are giving information about a REAL historical object, then at least do it right.Overall, this is an enjoyable game but I would recommend you to wait for a discount.";1;71,6;2/10/2018;276;8;;7.0

26;Action;00,00;First off let me say that while this is a negative review, SOTTR is not a terrible game. It's a well polished AAA that just happens to have enough issues to make it a disappointing end to the reboot trilogy. Steam does not let me rate a game out of 10 and I'm unwilling to give it a thumbs up, so here we are.Let's start with what the game does well. The environmental design in this game is superb. The variation isn't huge because there's no globe hopping in this game (you'll be seeing a lot of jungle,) but the attention to detail and art direction meant I never cared. This is a beautiful game to look at.Eidos Montreal has also done a very good job of porting this to the PC. I read early reviews saying there were some performance issues but a month after release those seem to have been resolved. I'm running and FX6300 and GTX970 with 8GB RAM. It's not a beast of a machine by any means (the CPU is most definitely a bottleneck,) but I was still able to run the game on the 'High' preset at 1080p and achieve a solid 60fps in closed areas and 45fps in open areas and cities. Whilst talking about graphics I also want to mention that the temporal anti-aliasing in this game is top notch, there wasn't a jaggy edge in sight.Moving onto gameplay, this is where things become a bit more mixed. On the good side of things the platforming is as fluid as the previous two games, but more importantly, Eidos have finally managed to get the 'right' amount of actual tomb raiding into the game. Tomb Raider 2013 really suffered for having really poor tombs that felt like little more than small caves with basic physics puzzles. Crystal Dynamics improved this a fair bit in Rise of the Tomb Raider with longer tombs and more complex puzzles (even if the theming of the tombs wasn't always very tomb-like). With Shadow of the Tomb Raider we're finally back to something fans of the pre-reboot games might recognize. Really lengthy tombs with complex multi-stage puzzles. I really can't understate how much better this aspect of the game is compared to the previous two.The problems with the gameplay start to become apparent a few hours in when you realise that you're almost getting too much of a good thing. Whereas the previous reboot games would intersperse sections of tomb raiding and exploration with gun fights, the combat in SOTTR has been seriously reduced. And when I say reduced I mean that other than a couple of dudes near the start, you won't be shooting anything other than guinea pigs and parrots for the first two thirds of the game. I can see why this has happened. the previous two reboot games got flak from some quarters for having too much gun-play. Personally I enjoyed those sections in TR2013 and ROTTR and don't think they had too much shooting, they just had too little tomb raiding. This lack of combat becomes a real problem because it means that the tomb raiding and exploration sections of SOTTR are just too long. What is actually really good gameplay when looked at by itself becomes tedious and repetitive. Something I really should have been enjoying was starting to make me feel bored.Worse than the lack of combat is the fact that what little combat does exist is just not very good. Eidos have introduced some new stealth mechanics and seem hell bent on forcing you to use them. You can now hide in bushes growing up walls which isn't really any different from hiding in bushes on the ground, it's just a new animation. You can also cover yourself in mud to hide from night vision goggles. There are three (I think,) instances in the game where you can use the mud mechanic. The mud patches are placed right at the entrance to a zone, to the point where you can't really progress to the combat without covering yourself in mud. You're given so little agency over this mechanic and it seems to make so little difference to the gameplay that I can't really figure out why they bothered to include it. My only guess is that they had something similar in the advertising cinematic so felt they needed to include it in the game.The enemy AI is clearly tuned towards the player using stealth. If you break cover they have pinpoint accuracy. Not that you will anyway because there are sections of the game where despite actually still having all your weapons (you haven't had them stripped or lost them down a waterfall or anything,) the game will only let you stealth kill with your knife. Unfortunately killing in stealth isn't particularly fun either since the AI is as dumb as a bag of rocks. If you've ever maxed out stealth in Skyrim and had an enemy NPC not see you as you crouch right next to them and the corpse of their buddy, you'll know what I'm talking about. It might seem like I'm talking about the combat in this game a lot but it really is just such a massive step backwards compared to the previous two games.Combat is not the only problem with the gameplay though some of the others are directly related to it. The talent tree for example is lifted almost wholesale from Rise. Ninety percent of those talents are combat related and are therefore useless for most of the game. This really hinders any feeling of character progression. The crafting system likewise suffers since it's focused on upgrading weapons and armour which will rarely be used. The armour sets in the game do at least have some non-combat bonuses which improve yields on foraging and the like. However the main hub of the game will force you to use a disguise costume which has no bonuses at all. Yes, you read that right. You will spend the game earning armour sets which you then can't use for large sections of it.Lastly, lets talk about the story. I'll be brief to avoid spoilers. It's not very good. To be fair, the reboot games have never had the strongest writing but it has always been 'good enough'. TR2013 had the most cohesive narrative since it was almost entirely self contained. Rise expanded on the role of Trinity and offered quite a lot of backstory if you read all the collectable documents. SOTTR has very little set up. You get a McGuffin waved in your face at the start of the game by Trinity and then you won't see it or them again until the final third. The time in between is filled with Lara's introspection on her life and journey so far. It has the potential to really build her character but really just comes across as a bit whiny and self centred. By far the most relatable character is her friend Jonah, almost to the point where I was wishing he was the protagonist.The 'big bad' in SOTTR is the biggest let down. We've had two games building up Trinity as some world spanning illuminati type organisation and yet the 'big bad' feels so loosely connected to them. I think you could probably remove all references to Trinity from the game and it would make no difference to the character of 'big bad'. Considering this is the final instalment in the trilogy it feels like it offers zero closure when it come to the main antagonists of the series.tl.drGOOD:  Graphics  Platforming / exploration  Tombs / puzzles  PerformanceBAD:  Story  Pacing / not enough combat  Enforced stealth, with poor stealth mechanics  Talents, weapons and armour are useless for most of the gameRATING: 6.5 / 10;0;56,3;17/10/2018;327;4;;6.0

Horrible, horrible behaviour.

On this third iteration, everything just feels bland, old, and dare I say boring? I don't know. I'm playing it and (I think I'm) kind of enoying myself, but nowhere near the fun I had with the previous two entries. With those, I didn't play other games until I finished them...with this one, I find myself playing it for an hour or two then wandering off to another game or doing something else entirely. It just can't hold my interest for very long because while it's a perfectly functional game, it's just a by the numbers game. There's entertainment to be had, sure, but at some point you might be asking yourself, ""why am I playing this?""This is one of the those games that makes me wish Steam had a ""meh"" option. I guess I'll give it a thumbs up since there are some fun parts and it's not a bad game by any means, but I would definitely wait for 50% off or more before buying.I guess there just wasn't much to iterate on, so as I said, it's probably for the best that this is the end of this reboot.";1;29,0;15/09/2018;279;9;;4.0

But I thought, ""Hey, I'm going to give it a fair shot. I don't really care about graphics, as long as I'm just having fun."" So, I bought it at full price, and booted up the game, excited to cause some delicious mayhem!I wanted to like this game. I really did! But I did not.

Okay, what about grenades?! Please tell me you at least have some dam GRENADES. It's like a staple in ever action game ever. No? *sigh* I'll just continue this boring mission. Wait, where am I going?

So I have to go to this menu, into that sub-menu, into that tab, into that selection, and then choose the addition, and then choose the specific type of addition (while holding down a key and cycling through them only with another random key) and... these are the worst controls. You know what? IO'm done. I'm F*CKING DONE WITH THIS BS!"" *closes game and goes into steam to order my refund.(Also, there are only sport cars on the roads, so it doesn't feel special when you drive one. And, the cars are way too boring. Also, the controls for driving SUCK A*S.)I should also note that the liberation system that has been some of the best parts of the series is now gone, and replaced with a stupid squad system that you have to earn and unlock, and it's all just very confusing. Trust me.In summary, this game seemed to say, ""Hey, if we just slap the Just Cause logo onto the front of it, people will buy it! Don't worry too much about gameplay or the fundamental fun parts about the previous games. It's all about that sweet, sweet revenue."" It pays too much attention to the small things like radio songs and customizing how fast a balloon inflates than the basic point of a game. TO HAVE FUN.

27;Action; 352,91;"Plus Points:+ Absolutely stunning map. Best world design in the Just Cause series so far.+ Large variety of interesting vehicles and weapons+ Grappler tools are funMinus Points:- You can't liberate bases and settlements anymore. You can still blow stuff up, but everything you destroy will just respawn and doesn't count towards the completion of the game like in previous entries to the series. This makes destruction, which has always been the main point of the Just Cause games, completely pointless.- Instead of destroying enemy bases, you now liberate regions using ""squads"". You earn these for doing pretty much anything in the game, including blowing stuff up, but they are so easy to get you'll never be short of them. Once you have earned enough you can click the region on your map and it will suddenly be liberated. This means you can liberate many regions without even actually going there (for some regions you have to do a single short mission first). You can completely liberate the entire map without visiting most of it. And that is a shame since the map is so beautiful. The map is filled with interesting locations and well-designed enemy bases, but you have no real way or incentive of interacting with it. I do like the frontline mechanic since it makes the world feel more like there is an actual war going on, but they should not have removed the need to destroy enemy bases to liberate regions, which was the main content of all previous Just Cause games.-In this vast, beautiful map, there is really nothing to do except the story missions, of which there are not very many, are short and so far have been quite forgettable (I haven't finished them all yet so I hope it gets better near the end). The archaeology missions are fun though (even if they paint a very unrealistic picture of what archaeology is like), but maybe I am just saying that because I am an archaeologist and just love what I do. There is also challenges to complete in every region, but they are just boring ""fly or drive through these hoops"" affairs and they are not actually challenging at all.To sum it up, Just Cause 4 is a fun sandbox to mess around in. It has a beautiful, well-designed map but the game doesn't really make use of it. Everything you destroy just respawns after a little while, so all the sandbox action unfortunately quickly starts to feel pointless. And once you grow tired of pointlessly destroying the same stuff over and over again the only thing to do is bland story missions and dumb repetitive challenges. It really had the potential to be a great game, but it got screwed over by one massive, really bad change in the core game design. Respawning, pointless bases really aren't fun, and destroying these massive complexes in inventive ways used to be the primary fun thing to do in Just Cause games.  By making them just respawn, the developers took out all of the satisfaction you got from destroying them. And without all that fun, Just Cause 4 is really just the empty shell of a Just Cause game.Please play Just Cause 3 or 2 instead, they are much, much better games that will keep you entertained for far longer, even despite the horrible optimisation and performance of Just Cause 3. At least that is one more plus point for Just Cause 4, it does run great with almost no lag, stuttering or crashes which JC3 suffered from a lot. Unfortunately that does not compensate for its lack of fun gameplay.";0;17,2;15/04/2019;456;10;;2.0
27;Action; 352,91;It's.. sorta worth it if you get it very on sale. But just get Just Cause 3. It's a better game. This game feels like the devs forgot what made Just Cause 3 so much fun. I think the best example of this is how region takeovers are performed. This is the core gameplay loop. to progress the story you need to liberate the area that missions take place in, often multiple areas per story mission. This should be one of the most fun parts of the game. It is in JC3, but not in JC4.In Just Cause 3, you take over areas by liberating military outposts. You 'liberate' them by... blowing everything up. If it's a static object with red bits, it's explosive and you need to remove it. There are some awesome really big setpiece things to destroy, like massive radar dishes. This fits in with the core gameplay perfectly. you can seamlessly transition between tearing things apart with your grappling hook, to hijacking a helicopter to fire missiles at them, to crashing the helicopter into one last tower before switching to a mounted gun, or your RPG, or anything. In Just Cause 4, you take over regions by.. performing really boring missions inside the bases. The enemy spawn rate seems to have gone down compared to JC3. you'll sometimes find yourself totally alone in these enemy bases. Without a focus on destroying things, almost your entire toolkit as a player is worthless. No need for vehicles. their destructive capabilities are wasted, and getting around is actually faster without them. No big set pieces to find fun ways to tear apart, because that's not the objective anymore, it's hack this console, escort these refugees, pull those breakers, stand still in this small area to complete an upload.;0;11,2;6/06/2021;372;1;;2.0
27;Action; 352,91;"Before you buy this game, you should really listen to the negative reviews. I ignored them, thinking it would be another JC game that I would enjoy, and that the negative reviews were just the result of some day 1 bugs or people's expectations being too high.Oh, was I wrong. This is actually a bad game. There are an extreme amount of reasons for this. Graphical glitches, absolutely unacceptable graphics/textures/etc. considering how JC3 looked, bad- no, TERRIBLE story. Many features from JC3 have been removed, like the sticky explosives, pistols, and liberation mechanics, which is literally the whole focal point of the game. All of my actions feel entirely disconnected from the outcome of my actions. I go and download some files, and bam I've liberated an entire region. Where in JC3 it felt good liberating areas and took some work, in JC4 it's literally you pressing a button. The missions are so, so much worse. They're all bland ""go here, wait for bar to go up/down, you win!"" missions, which brings me to my biggest gripe with the game:IT IS BORING. It is so unbelievably boring that you could easily fall asleep playing it. You know how destroying things is important in Just Cause games? Well, not in this one. Sure, you get chaos points, but you could just get them doing other things. The stuff you destroy eventually respawns, the weapons have low ammo counts, and destroying things isn't nearly as cathartic as it was in JC3.In the end, if you want this game, go buy Just Cause 3. If you already have it, buy the DLC. If you've already 100% the game and all of it's DLC, then replay the game because you're going to get way more enjoyment out of that then mindlessly roaming around a map looking for something to do.";0;12,4;27/04/2019;616;13;;1.0
27;Action; 352,91;Just Cause 4 forgets its origins.In JC3 the game and it's story seem carefully crafted to NOT take itself too seriously and just enjoy its mechanics of mayhem and destruction.  The witty banter, an over the top dictator, enjoyable destruction via wacky physics, and a whole mess of over powered weaponry entertained me through its main game and all its DLC.JC4 on the other hand takes a turn from some of those elements.  Rico isnt as funny anymore and is border line brooding. He doesn't have any witty companions, the story seems to want to take itself seriously and some of those wacky physics are a bit too wacky.  The departure from its predecessor came as a suprise to me and I believe is a direct result to some of the lesser gripes I was muttering to myself as I played the game.  The choppy water was gone and had been replaced with really crappy looking water. I know, not a big thing, but the waves in JC3 gave life to that part of the game.  It's hard not to notice its absence.Helicopter controls became worse and it was almost impossible for me to target enemy choppers using missiles.  I hardly even know how to describe this issue with text. I literally can not shoot a missile at a flying enemy unless the aiming reticle is on them and turns red, but if that enemy is moving forget about it, because you have to lead your target only you can't because your reticle has to be on the target to get it to turn red so you can shoot at it unless its moving...ARGGGGGHHHH!Some changes, like removing grenades and replacing them with secondary functions on certain weapons have left me on the fence. Most of the secondary functions are great and enjoyable, but I personally like the staple of having grenades at all times. If that was something I wanted to maintain as I played it meant that I had to carry a specific weapon with me that had that secondary function.  And since you can only carry two weapons with you I often times felt limited.  Planted explosives are also gone which is something I miss.  The map just seems so much smaller than JC3.  I bet this statment is false, but I burned through it so damn fast it felt* smaller by comparison.  The introduction of front lines where the rebels are fighting the enemy initially seemed like it would be a cool thing, but there was so little impact to whatever I was doing or how I was progressing through the game it made me wonder why it was there in the first place.  Instead of liberating multiple small settlements to free zones now all one has to do is a single mission. And there are only 3 or 4 versions of that mission and they just aren't as engaging. It seems odd to look back at JC3 and find that the repetitive nature of freeing settlements by blowing up the same damn things was more fun, but there it is.I don't really hate JC4. I can still do goofy things and I have fun with the new tether options that are available.  I gripe because it moved away from things that I liked or expected to see again from JC3.  This game falls into the category of sequels where instead of getting the previous game plus more*, I got a little less with some changes that just didn't measure up to its predecessor.  I haven't given up on this game, but I won't likely spend much time on it unless the DLC's bring something special with them.;0;54,3;20/12/2018;1264;35;;4.0
27;Action; 352,91;I'm really torn on writing this review. Just Cause 4 does do some things very well, but other things are a major step backwards from JC3.As a sandbox, JC4 is great. The grapple has been further improved over JC3 with the new balloons and upgrades to the existing boosters and tether. There's a nice variety of terrain to explore and random stuff to blow up, and a lot more working utility vehicles with functional cranes and forklifts for example. Plus there's new weather control bases you can use to spawn destructive weather at will once they've been captured.Unfortunately, as a game, JC4 just isn't that much fun at times. JC3 got a lot of flak for the base liberation being repetitive and tedious at times and JC4 tried to address that with more missions. On the surface this seems like a good idea until you realize that the same few annoying mission objectives are copy-pasted multiple times with just slight variations. To make things worse, many of these objectives involve defending fragile items or hacking terminals with a countdown timer where you can't do anything else, and have to restart when interrupted. The endless respawning hyper-aggresive AI in Just Cause has always been a problem, and mission objectives like these just highlight how bad it is when attack helicopter after attack drone appears out of nowhere and does massive damage to the fragile item you have to protect. Worse, the controls are frequently unresponsive and the gunplay is sloppy, and the endless respawning enemies include way too many soldiers with grenade/rocket launchers that will ragdoll you all over the place. Not to mention that the DEVS REMOVED C4!!!This is why I'm torn on this review. The sandbox is great, but it's locked behind a lot of content that's more frustrating than fun, and the linear missions remove the freedom you had in earlier games on how to approach liberating bases.At the end of the day I've decided to recommend this game with major caveats. Get it on sale, do not pay full price for this. Use a savegame or mod that opens up the sandbox much earlier and save yourself the frustration of dealing with the poor mission design.The Good:World is more varied and interesting than JC3PROPER TRACKED TANKS!!!Working actuators on vehicles like cranes and forkliftsImproved grapple abilitiesInteresting weapons with alternate fire modesCutscenes and story are surprisingly decent with lots of humorFriendly tanks/choppers will occasionally help you out in combatThe Bad:Can't take over bases by blowing stuff up, have to complete annoyingly linear missions including dreaded escort/protect/hacking objectivesAI is still as annoying and bad as ever with enemies appearing out of thin air right next to youSloppy on-foot/grapple controls and gunplayBikes are terrible to driveLess destroyable bridges compared to JC3The Ugly:NO C4!!!Update:I got the gold edition with the DLC and finished playing through the DLC content, so here's a quick review of the DLC:Weaponized Wingsuit:Awesome, one of the best reasons to get the gold edition. Makes some missions much easier since you have infinite wingsuit missiles. More or less the same thing you get from JC3's sky fortress DLC.Dare Devils of Destruction:Mad Max style death races in JC4. The new vehicle variants with guns are fun, but the actual missions themselves are annoying score attack objectives that you'll need to replay repeatedly to unlock everything. 5/10, worth playing if you have gold, hard to recommend getting if you don't.Los Demonios:Bad, bad, bad. If you have gold, I wouldn't recommend even starting the mission arc. The rewards aren't even remotely worth it (a crossbow and the ability to spawn the super annoying demon bugs anytime), and if you start the mission arc you'll need to finish the awful missions to get the map back to its original state (demon bug infestations block you from completing some of the vehicle/wingsuit stunts until they're cleared). At least clearing the infestations involves liberation style destroy everything missions instead of protecting/hacking things. The first mission itself is fine at least and moderately interesting, but it goes downhill fast after that. Final boss fight is a new level of awfulness for the franchise worthy of a spot on the list of worst video game boss fights of all time. 1/10, don't waste your time on this content, it will actively make the rest of the game worse until it's fully completed.Danger Rising:Actually a good DLC. Lots of new toys to play with, interesting locations to liberate by destroying everything, and some more story content with Rico and the Agency to boot. Only negatives are some of the mandatory hoverboard challenges to open the reactors are annoying and don't make sense from a gameplay or logical standpoint. 9/10, great DLC pack.;1;70,1;6/11/2019;465;18;;5.0
27;Action; 352,91;"Was really hoping for this to be good...I loved Just Cause 2 AND 3 and Just Cause 3 was a game that I could waste many, many hours on whenever I was bored.Just Cause 3's addition of a wingsuit felt like something that fit perfectly in the game and the controls were seemingly tight and fluid. The challenge system for unlocking upgrades was annoying at first but at least it forced you to actually use the things in question and, by extension, get better at using them. Soon, after a bit of grinding, I could take down bases with ease, grappling through on my wingsuit as fueltanks blew up behind me. Rico was unstoppable.Then the Sky DLC came out for it (only DLC that was worth it) and everything got better. Suddenly, Rico was a literal super hero, nothing could stop me, barrel-rolling through obstacles as I pumped missles into them from my back, only to dive into the water, jet away under the waves and launch up from underneath like f***ing Iron Man....Now, I bought this with the deluxe content because i wanted that experience of flying a jetpack wingsuit and destablilizing a nation again.What I got was:1) Terrible controls for the wingsuit: Airbraking now stops you dead in the air? No Swooping, no changing directions suddenly, everything feels more sluggish...2) The DLC Jetpack has been bastardized: Your charge for boost gets used up whether you use it fully or not. Accidentally tapped the button? There's all your boost gone. Missiles are innacurate and sometimes just flat bounce off of things. You lose all your speed the millisecond you're done boosting so its usually faster to grapple everywhere. Its so damn hard to manuever when boosting as well, so more often than not you end up smashing your face in. AND WHY OH WHY did the devs get rid of the launching by holding the wingsuit button. It was the coolest thing ever to launch out of an explosion like a damn super hero....3) Graphics: Im not usually one to care too much about graphics as long as it's fun but the water was the one thing that actually took me out of the game because of how bad it looked. I dont want to gripe but JC3 had water that looked a billion times better than this flat, out-of-focus, brown sludge that's everywhere. Not to mention the glitchy texture breaks and the fact that your parachute shows up as a reflection that looms larger than the mountains. And what is up with Tom Sheldons glowing facial hair...4) Gameplay: The story in this game is as cookie cutter as it comes. Escort mission after Escort mission after Escort mission. And for the Piece de Resistance for some unforseen reason, the developers of this game decided to get rid of the most fun aspect of the Just Cause Series: The Chaos. In JC3 and 2 the base liberation revolved around destroying enough enemy infrastructure to to remove their presence from the region. This provided some of the best gameplay experiences that I've had in a while. It gave me a reason to want to unlock and upgrade my weapons and vehicles. Nothing better than clearing a base with a single Bavarium Nuke. In JC4, base liberation is boring, only capturing an entire region when you have enough squads to move a line on your map to encompass that area and then that base is yours, fully intact. The game world is also considerably less destructible, I've only found wooden bridges that i was able to destroy when I had a ton of fun in JC3 sending trains and patrols to their deaths by blowing the bridge at a safe distance....5) Weapons: I've played about 9 hours so far, a lot of which was flying through f***ing rings to get more missiles and more boost for my jet wingsuit, and I've yet to find any weapons that really excited me. Plastic explosives have been completely removed from the game, replaced by booster rockets, which i assume the devs thought everyone liked better, and even then those only explode when modded enough to be useless as boosters.6) Grappling: This grapple system is split into 3 loadouts, which you can switch between freely. However, I would find that I would often need to change my loadout in the menu in the middle of a fight to get the effect I wanted, which completely shatters my fun and immersion. The grapple having all these effects is, for me, way more annoying than fun. I liked the simplicity of JC3 where you had to use the environment to lift things or switch your explosives for boosters to get that effect, and having the grapple just grapple things together and pull.All in all, I think the devs thought they were (or maybe actually were) being pressured to innovate everything to keep things fresh, when in reality they pretty much destroyed everything that I personally enjoyed about the game.Edit: Dec 12, 2018, 5:36pmCouple of extra points about JC4 that I've found after completing the whole game and all side missions:Enemy A.I. seems to be pretty well improved and after going back and playing JC3 right after beating 4, I will say that combat on the ground is better in every way (besides ammo), it feels way more tactile and headshots have a great feel to them, unlike in JC3.The weather, since it was a selling point, should have been implemented more. The three or four types of weather in the game pretty much only exist around the bases it spawns from. I only played one mission other than the main base missions that featured a sandstorm to deal with and I have to say it made the ""pick up a sniper and protect mission"" I'd done 10 times already way more fun and worth doing. Why wasnt the weather everywhere on the map???       Also yes I understand there were guns that simulated the weather effects (lightning and wind) but why weren't players rewarded with a more powerful version to have fun with, with this being a physics sandbox? I would've rather had a small scale tornado to play with or the chaotic winds of a sandstorm to release on enemies than a windblast and random lightning.Storywise this game takes itself way too seriously. I see a lot of people talking about how JC3 had a s*** story with no humour like what was in JC2 (admittedly JC2 was over-the-top parody funny and I had a ton of fun with my friends playing it), but JC3 had humour of its own with Mario and Rico interacting and DiRivello was, in my opinion, a great villian which you got to see insight into with the collectibles in the game (audio tapes). JC4, in comparison, felt like the devs were trying to hit a way darker tone with the fate of Rico's family and Sheldon's reconciliation. All in all it made for (in my opinion) very shallow experience with characters that you didn't care for at all.The side missions felt tacked on to me. they were more a delivery system for upgrades than actual story bits. The movie producer (forgot her name) was the only one that had actual cutscenes and she's the one I cared about the least. Sargento was the one character I actually cared about, since it seemed Rico felt for him and was taking him under his wing (no pun intended), however he only gets one mission with a cutscene or any plot, the rest he just tells you to do the same thing, with the same recycled lines over the radio (rescue, escort, or snipe). No character growth or interest whatsoever. Javi's missions were cool but were over way too quickly. They all take place on one portion of the map, which is the most boring because there isnt any weather effects or higher level bases nearby.Thus concludes my edited review, let me know what ya'll think or if there is anything I missed.";0;18,6;4/12/2018;741;27;;2.0
27;Action; 352,91;"UpdateI have now finished the game, got every achievement (except the hidden ones, the one about beating a friends feat and the one for getting all achievements). I like this game, once you get through the meh story missions to unlock all the regions and the god-awful liberation missions. It is fun to just fly around in whilst watching YouTube on the other screen. Other than that... Still bad. I do not recommend this, having to do 20+ hours of crap to get to an OK game is really not a good way to spend your time.TL.DRLess explodey version of JC3, if you liked JC3's ""explode everything"" mentality you probably wont like this.Replaced the ""explode all the things to liberate province"" missions with ""push this button/escort these guys/turret section to liberate province"" missions.Pros, Mehs, and ConsPros:More vehicle variety than JC3.The wingsuit is back, and just as awesome as ever.Winner of the ""prettiest explosions"" award.The alternate fire modes for the weapons is a good addition.Travelling anywhere in this game is fun. I spent most of my time just flying around the map.Meh:No pistols/dual-fire weapons, they were nice but I don't miss them too badly.New way of sorting weapons. Allows for any two weapons to be carried.Battles in the world between the Rebals and the Black Hand/Loyalists are cool to take part in a few times, but mostly don't do anything interesting and get boring very quickly.Balloons on grapples, kinda useless in combat and the novelty of sending people skywards wears off quicker than you would think.Vehicles have amunition counts now, was probably put in to force you to be more flexable in combat. But I never ran out of ammo before my tank exploded or I flew into the ground anyway.The map is waaaay less interesting than JC2 or JC3.Cons:No grenades... Seriously who thought this was a good idea?No C4 explosives. This would go really well with the new grapple mechanic, not sure why they put in the balloons instead.This is the big one. ""Liberating"" a province now requires you to complete a specific mission in that province. As opposed to blowing up everything as in JC3. These get really boring really quickly.Once you are done, you're done. No replayability.OpinionsLiterally eveything that has changed from JC3 would be fine and I would have no problem shouting from the rooftop that you should buy this game if it wasn't for the stupid decision to go away from the ""liberate a province by blowing up all of the red stuff"" to the ""liberate a province by doing this mission"" core gameplay loop.As of writing this I have played about six of these liberation missions and I have exactly zero enthusiasm to play any more. The whole set of game mechanics seem setup for you to have loads of different and interesting ways to go about rapidly deconstructing everything around you in a glorious cacophony of fire and noise. But then the liberation missions (escort missions, push this button over there missions, defend this thing missions) feel constrictive and empty.If these were switched out for JC3 style ""explode everything in this area and you win"" type liberations, then the game would be excellent.As it is, all of the peripheral side tasks and environment are epic, the liberation missions that make up the core of the gameplay, kinda poo.If you are new to the series, get JC3 instead.";0;119,6;25/12/2018;256;12;;2.0

28;Adventure; 106,90;I went into this game really hopeful. Episode one was great, the atmosphere was great, the story hook was great and everything felt really immersive. It felt like you really were in the shoes of Sean, desperately trying to protect himself and his brother in such a messed up situation. The only gripe I had with it was the facial animations were practically nonexistent and the voice acting was a little rough, and it brought me out of the story at times. I thought little of it, however, as it was still the first episode and episodes were to take longer to come out than the first game. When the second episode came out, I was more than a little disappointed by the lack of facial animation, but the voice acting did seem better. The second episode, story-wise still felt like a natural progression to the story, though the time-skip was a little off putting. Everything still worked, the direction the story was going was clear, the stakes were clear and it still felt immersive. I had a couple issues with how they handled a few things, but again, I enjoyed it more than I had issues with it.Then comes episode three. Still no improvement on the facial animations, the voice acting was worse than the first episode, the time skip mixed caused another bump in my ability to remain connected with the story and dear all gods Daniel became the most annoying little scamp I have ever been forced to play alongside. The first bits I could have gladly ignored if they continued with having lovable and relatable characters, but Daniel went from your kind of annoying little brother to a total brat. Sean is then blamed for this transition for doing little other than having other friends completely despite the fact Daniel has his own other friend too. The story takes an odd turn, which could be justified were the execution a little better, but the time skip gets rid of any execution at all, you are simply thrown into it and it is apparently what you have been doing for a while. The time skips feel less like a way to keep the story going and more like a way to ignore doing extra writing, and  the story is suffering greatly for it.The fourth episode (Actual spoilers, from here on) is what managed to make me lose faith in the game. We are greeted to yet another time skip, Sean having been in the hospital for a decent chunk of time and about to go on trial and Daniel is missing. Now, I was forgiving and thought we were in for an interesting start with the hospital escape, then a scene happens that seriously rubs me the wrong way. Sean takes a break from driving to sleep and it turns out he is on the private property of racists. I do not know if this can be avoided, but for me at least it ended with Sean getting the living heavens beat out of him. And then nothing happens. The scene does not matter later in the story, it is just there to give Sean some more pain on top of all the pain he is already in. I do not know if they added it in either because they wanted their main character to suffer more or if they thought this was clever writing relating to topical events happening right now, but the scene could have been removed from the game and literally the game would be the exact same. That is not good writing.Then we come to the part where we finally see Daniel again and he is in some sort of cult and praised as a sign from god. All immersion with the story I held onto was thrown out the window. This is so far away from the original presented story that I do not even know where the writers are taking this anymore and trust me when I say that is not a good thing. Sean is then promptly blamed for being a bad brother, despite all of the constant sacrafices he makes to keep Daniel happy and healthy. I will bring that up later, because if you have played the game, you know exactly where this goes from bad to full on unhealthy and problematic. Sean then gets to meet his mother, who I guess shows her face again to save Daniel despite abandoning both her children and her husband. You can tell they try to make you like this character, but as someone who has had both parents abandon them, it didn't work. Maybe for some people it did but her only excuse is being forced into the role of a mother by society, so she couldn't live out her dreams. That pissed me off so much, I did not have words. Maybe it would have been fine if she still remained a part of their lives, or if she even at least wrote them letters or at least let them know she still cared but no. She was gone without a trace and we are supposed to be okay with that because society made her. That is beyond upsetting and treats Sean and Daniel less like children and more like burdens to her. Finally, everyone bands together to free Daniel. I really could not care less about anyone except for Sean, who is the only character in this game I still like. Which is just wonderful as we are treated to him getting beat up over and over to prove that he really does care about Daniel. What in the ever living hell did Sean do to deserve that? He has shown nothing but concern over his brother who has constantly disregarded him and acted like a brat. Heavens forbid he spend a bit of time with friends while still taking care of his brother. I really, really do not know what the writers are going with here, that scene was disturbing for reasons I do not think they were intending. The only way I can think this as being anything but poor writing would be if they go with the clever route of actually showcasing this behavior as dangerous and Daniel as an antagonist who refuses to learn. I really think that might be the only saving grace for the story, paired with proper facial animations and voice acting because oh my, did they drop the ball on this episode, so hard the ball shattered and we are left with a bunch of expressionless characters and unfitting voices acting out what can only be described as a soap opera that has gone on so long they needed to go completely off the wall for shock value.;0;3,6;1/10/2019;232;9;;2.0
28;Adventure; 106,90;Loved the first life is strange game. The characters were corny and awkward, just like in any story based around teen drama. However, I always felt engaged in the mystery and pushing the plot forward. The game play was also very satisfying. The power to explore different choices and rewind the clock made it a good match for a narrative style player choice driven game. Life is strange 2 lacks the same charm. It still has the corny writing, but I didn't warm to the characters or the story. It had no grand mystery and game play was less engaging. Firstly because you don't play as the brother with the powers and the powers themselves aren't as interesting or as satisfying as time manipulation. I get what they were trying to do, but it just kept falling flat. I kept playing out of obligation, rather than intrigue. I wanted to like this game, but I just left feeling underwhelmed.So overall, not terrible. Just a hard act to follow.;0;14,5;1/06/2020;257;3;;6.0

28;Adventure; 106,90;I played ‚Life is Strange 2‘ a year ago and I still can’t get it out of my head. I’ve never had such an intense experience with a game. Ever!I’m an over 50 years old guy and I couldn’t stop crying when I finished the last episode. The emotions hurled me out of my regular life for a complete week and even now, after so many months, I still can’t listen to the soundtrack or some of the trailers without heavy sobbing.I like emotional and story driven games and I’ve played many, but non of them had such an impact on me, not even LiS1.I tried to play the game as realistically as possible, which means I never went back once I made a decision. I regretted some of them, but that made it even better, because that’s how it is in real life and it makes it easier to identify with the main character Sean.There were a few moments where I missed alternative ways to deal with a situation, where I thought that a character acted illogical or where I felt that something was forced on me, but those were just a handful of negligible moments and forgivable.The game really shines when it comes to pacing, which had always been DONTNOD’s strong suit. I was constantly strung up and afraid of making mistakes that’ll hurt Daniel and/or Sean (remember: no reload for me). But quite often, LiS2 lets the player breath, enjoy the moments of calm and silence. I treasure those moments and I’m glad the devs know where to put them in order to enrich the story.---When the weather is right and I’m in the mood, I snatch my sketchbook, listen to the soundtrack from LiS2 (cry a little) and go for a walk. Sometimes I find something interesting enough to draw or scribble, sometimes not. It doesn’t matter, because every time I remember how I traveled together with Sean and Daniel. It was a year ago and it was “just a game”, but it was also a one-of-a-kind experience and the memories still accompany me.No other game has ever managed this.;1;24,2;20/08/2021;80;0;;10.0

28;Adventure; 106,90;Episode 1 is great.If you're reading all the reviews mentioning politics, just keep in mind that some people are going focus on that more than you might. I played through all of episode 1 expecting a really preachy scene or constant victimization like I had read about in other reviews and it never really happened. I think some people are just primed to take everything as a personal attack.Beyond all that, the story in EP1 sets up an interesting dynamic between surviving and looking after your little sibling. Where in Life is Strange 1 a choice may cause a character to trust you now and work with you later, in LiS 2, a choice might mean the difference between eating or having to steal to live, with each outcome impacting your little brother in positive or negative ways, as he both depends on you, and looks to you to set an example.The choices in EP1 are not earth-shattering, but if you've played LiS 1, you know that your choices make bigger ripples in EP2 or even EP4, so hopefully we see the same growth.Overall, the same level of storytelling is there, but the next few episodes will really dictate whether the story blooms like the first Life is Strange or not.;1;3,2;2/10/2018;206;2;;8.0

28;Adventure; 106,90;So I played through chapters one and two, and to be honest, I doubt I'll end up playing further than that. First off, some disclaimers to be fair to the creators: the gameplay is very smooth and the environments are rich. I would never say that this is a bad game because I don't think it is. I just think that it falls down on what it tries to make the heart of the game experience, which is the two main brothers, and I think that a lot of the mistakes made in the original LiS are carried over here. First off, the brothers: they have their charming moments. Their relationship does feel real, as does Sean's anxiety about taking care of his brother. In the first episode, I enjoyed Daniel as a child character who felt like a child but who could still be helpful in his own right. I think that the second episode really fell down on this, though. Many of the conflicts that crop up in the second episode happen because of Daniel's childish insistence on making dumb decisions, and the narrative forces you to go along with them even if you try to say no. Not only does this leave me as a player feeling like my choices don't matter, but it leads to me resenting Daniel because the narrative has used him as a device to force me into doing things I don't want to for no good reason. (If he were sick and I had to do something dangerous to take care of him, that'd be one thing, but doing dumb things because he's bored puts my teeth on edge.) The beginning of Chapter 3 did nothing to make me feel like this issue would be resolved, since it started off with the player rewarding Daniel for stealing from him. So due to the way the narrative uses Daniel as an obstacle rather than a motivation for player decisions, I find what could have been a charming character insufferable. I would be more patient if he were a real flesh and blood child, but he's a character made of code intended to contribute to an entertaining experience, and in the second chapter, he doesn't for me. Because of this, the investment I had in Sean's growth as a brother figure and the development of their relationship soured. This is on top of the fact that sometimes the game forces you into making decisions you don't want to and can think of a perfectly logical way around, but I think it's unfair to ding games for that too hard. I've only ever seen a couple multi-choice games really allow for completely divergent story lines, and they had armies of programmers for a reason. I get that sometimes you need to railroad the story a bit.There's also the fact that it doesn't feel like this game has any unique gameplay elements the way that the original LiS did. Sean can't manipulate time, and he can't really do anything else either. Daniel is the one with powers, and from a gameplay standpoint, it's a little boring to have someone else be the one with powers and I occasionally order them around (and sometimes they won't even listen to me). I appreciate the risk this was from a story standpoint, but it doesn't really add to the gameplay and the whole thing ends up a bit tacked on, peripheral to the main conflict. Maybe Sean will develop powers later on, but I feel like I gave the game a fair shake by giving it two chapters, and the second chapter really didn't do much to inspire me to keep going. Like I said: I don't think the game is bad. I think that there are a lot of people who would absolutely love it and think Daniel is charming and have no problem with the bland gameplay. But for me personally, this was enough for me to go on to other games.;0;10,2;5/06/2019;277;10;;2.0
28;Adventure; 106,90;"I had a lot of doubts when purchasing this game after reading negative reviews. But after playing all four available at the moment episodes I could say that they're misleading. Most points were like (please forgive me for possible grammar, spelling or lexical mistakes as english is not my native language):1. ""Second game is nothing like first"" - that's quite true, but why it should be? The most missing mechanic (as I could understand) is the time rewind. But this series named ""Life is strange"" and the story follows this line. New mechanics can appeal to someone or not, but you shouldn't just await the game to repeat the same thing over and over. 2. ""Too much politics"" - well, that's a confusing term. So far I hadn't find any government relation to the story at all. Most of it is just people outlook, ideology, perception, stupidity or misconceptions. It's not a bad thing essentially, it's just life.3. ""Too much agressive racism"" - I had several moments where I could think that situations depiced are exeggerated. But after some thought, they're not unambiguous. Sometimes agressors were in the right in their own actions, and we all should understand that out there are a lot of different people with different views. And again, it's not the point of the story and game itself, it's just a several encounters that could be logically explained.4. ""Not enough choices and interactions"" - it could be true. I hadn't replayed it yet (waiting for the last episode before that) and couldn't assess if choices matter. But as for now, I feel that progression follows my own course. Probably I just selected canonic version that was designed at most. Anyway, even if the story is on rails, I, personally, enjoying how it's presented, even if it's just the false appereance of the free will.5. ""No character progression"" - can't argue with this one, mainly because besides two main characters anybody else just ride along in a single episode with short overlaps or flashbacks. It's a bit disappointing, I'd personally wanted to see a bit more involvement of secondary characters in the game. But, is it necessarily bad? The theme is a road trip, escape from ""the bad"" and trying to find a place to belong. If you spend some time to actually listen and interact with the world and people around you (not just rush the storyline) then you could know them a bit more, their stories and a background, and tend to like or dislike them, feel connected.6. ""Telltale clone, cinematic game, no puzzles, etc"" - yeah, that's it. If you don't like following the story, listening to the surroundings, be interested without ""quest taken"" or specific task assigned, explore and inquire, then it's game just not for you. Which is not making a game bad.UPD 21.09.19: 7. Some spoilers ahead for the gamer who hadn't play the game, be warned: ""The Daniel is being complete jerk"". Have you ever tried to put yourself in his shoes? To lost everything in your ""normal life"" and gain a supernatural power? It should change your character. And do not forget, he is pre-teen, he is growing and trying to cut off parental influence and make his own decisions. It's really a bad combo, and that's exactly what is shown there. It's driving me mad, but it's true. My own child without any powers could do the same in the future, and it's perfectly normal :)So, what am I trying to say? I'm glad that I bought this game despite negative reviews. It's a solid product, and I have no complains on it. It's not for everyone, but you could just try it out and find for youself.

29;Action; 124,99;All in all, this is a good game and worth playing. I was a bit skeptic, due to the mixed reviews (especially some people were still negative even by getting it in sale at 15€). I must say, at 15€ it's absolutely a bargain even with its flaws.Mankind Divided continues the story of human revolution, so i don't understand how some negative reviews bash this aspect of the game. It's a sequel, what did you expect?Some people hate the fact that there isn't a real tie-in to the choices taken in human revolution, in fact, you don't need a savegame. Did you save somebody? Did you pick a certain ending? It doesn't matter, the game will recap the first chapter and skip all these customization through careful dialogs and skilled story telling. It's a bit annoying, i can agree, but really, not that big deal like somebody tells.This game has a huge problem for many people: it's not human revolution. HR set the bar very high (especially considering the franchise. Do you remember the time when deus ex 1 was the only good deus ex?) and beating that was going to be a challenge: some people will never be happy.The game has a few flaws, and, in my opinion, are all cause of possible budget cuts or crunch time. Often you see a lack of variety (for example the underground loading screens) which should not be present in AAA games as this one. Do they break immersion? A little. Are they game breaking? Absolutely not. It is true, in order to shove a lot of content in the game (with side missions) many things are sospiciously convenient. Need to do side mission X? What a coincidence, it's just 20 meters over there, just the apartment in front side mission Y.Yet, the story is not bad (although take a few hours to get you engaged) and although i didn't like --- MINOR SPOILER AHEAD ---- the fact that it leaves the door open for a new chapter -------- END OF MINOR SPOIELR ----  i overall had fun.The final mission especially is my favourite part of the game even if it's probably a little too short.Some other minor annoying stuff are there, but really, it's still a very good game.

29;Action; 124,99;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is an absolutely beautiful, intricately detailed, amazingly realised piece of exposition. It improves upon Human Revolution in nearly every way, and I laud Edios for the amount of work and effort that went into this game, however it is clear that Square Enix cut this title into pieces to sell as DLC and future Deus Ex games and as a testing bed for the atrocious microtransactions. I had heard that Mankind Divided's main story ended quite abruptly, but when the New Game+ notification appeared and the credits began rolling I was in disbelief. I bought this game on the expectation that I was going to experience a complete story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Mankind Divided is only the beginning. It is frustrating, because everything about Mankind Divided is amazing. The fusion of classical European and post modern architecture is beautiful and this world is a distinct cyberpunk that stands alone from the masses of Blade Runner inspired worlds. The combat and stealth are a massive improvement over Human Revolution, and the level design is top notch all across the board. The story (main and side quests) and its themes, despite being a bit heavy handed and not thoroughly fleshed out, have so much potential in addition to the characters that inhabit them. Everything about this game screams potential, it is such a shame that Square Enix had to mess it up.;0;126,5;27/11/2016;2120;35;;8.0

29;Action; 124,99;"You're probably wondering why I'm ""Not recommending"" a game that I've invested literally 5 days of my life into. For one, because Steam doesn't have a ""meh"" option. but mainly, because compared to its predecessor Human Revolution, this game isn't really that good.Let's rewind to 2011, when HR was released. As a reboot of a much-loved series, it pretty much did everything right: great characters that you actually cared about, overarching plot that built to a very satisfying crescendo, and of course game mechanics that could suit anyone from the stealthiest hacker to the most gung-ho gunslinger. Yes, there were some rough edges, but they were easily forgivable given the scope and breadth of Eidos Montreal's accomplishment.Given all that, the most burning question on my mind is: how the hell did it then take them half a decade to release what is essentially an expansion to HR? And I use the word expansion deliberately, because overall Mankind Divided feels like less of a game than its older sibling.This is due to a lot of things. Firstly, and most importantly, instead of there being multiple cities between missions, there's one hub - Prague - that you return to repeatedly. Now, Prague definitely changes and evolves between each mission, but it doesn't really grow. you can visit almost the entirety of it right from the beginning of the game, which means that coming back to it time and time again becomes pretty boring.That isn't helped by the fact that Prague is just plain small. there are maybe a dozen streets with about the same number of side alleys. In terms of footprint it's probably larger than HR's Detroit and Hengsha combined, but those cities were redeemed by the fact that they had more going on on roofs and multi-storey apartment blocks than they did at street level. Prague has sewers, street level, a few empty apartments higher up and... that's it.The ridiculous load times, which were marginally acceptable in HR in 2011 but are actually offensive in MD in 2016, make this seem even worse because getting around becomes a chore. If Bethesda can ship Skyrim and Fallout 4 with multi-kilometre-square maps that have no loading times (apart from fast travel), then I fail to see why MD can't have a single seamless map for the maybe 1 square kilometre that makes up Prague. You literally have to endure a loading screen to get from one small half of Prague to the other... what? Why?Hey, did you like the characters in HR? Too bad, because you ain't gonna see them in this game! Sarif makes three video cameos, assuming you do the side mission involving him. Pritchard? Referenced a couple of times. Malik? Referenced once, extremely indirectly. Taggart? Referenced once (yeah, he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but still a well-portrayed one).What we have in their place are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes that exist for no other reason than to push the plot along. You have the hacker lady who literally does nothing, the gruff leader who doesn't like it when you go off script, his second-in-command who doesn't like you, and the pilot who also doesn't like you. None of them are particularly likeable or memorable, most just get on your nerves, and talking to them really doesn't affect or alter the outcome of the game in any way. Terrible lipsyncing doesn't help to endear them either.And then there's the villains - or should I say, villain. HR didn't do too well on this front, but at least it had more than one Big Bad and by extension, more than a single boss fight. MD has quite literally one boss fight, right at the end of the game, and you know exactly who it's going to be against BECAUSE THERE IS LITERALLY ONLY ONE CHARACTER IT CAN BE - a character you meet halfway through the game. Who is so laughably obviously the Big Bad, that all the contortions the game pulls to try to make you second-guess and think it's someone else are just cringeworthy.""Cringeworthy"" is a pretty good description of the plot, actually. This being a Deus Ex game, one would expect a meandering plot with a few dead ends, and while HR delivered, MD plays it pretty much straight. I don't have an issue with straight plots, even in a Deus Ex game - as long as they're played honest. MD doesn't do that. instead of owning its join-the-dots plot and trying to play to its strengths, it tries to obfuscate and hide that simplicity under layers and layers of unnecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and poorly-executed misdirection, and the end result is that it just ends up feeling needlessly annoying and forced.As for gameplay, it's HR with the rough edges mostly polished. Takedowns are easier to execute and stealthier in that Jensen actually (gasp!) attempts to hide his victims as part of the takedown animation. However, dragging unconscious enemies, or corpses, to hiding spots is just as irritating as HR, in that sometimes the dragging just stops for no apparent reason, or a limb gets stuck on something and you have to go around and pull from a different angle. And no, you still can't just PICK UP AND CARRY bodies, which would obviate this whole mess.Combat: just like everything else in MD, the selection of weapons is similar to HR, but lesser. On the plus side you now have the option to upgrade weapons with crafting parts that can be found and bought. on the downside, some of the most powerful weapons are no longer available. Presumably this is to encourage players to rely more on the new augmentations, but Deus Ex as a series has always been about choice, and MD takes away rather than giveth. Also, no Boxguards. :'(The new augs are pretty cool, although you can't really play with them until later in the game due to another arbitrary plot speedbump. The Remote Hacking aug in particular is probably my favourite (in fact I'd say it's almost essential), but again, it feels like something that could've and should've been in HR. There are a lot more lethal augs to complement the Typhoon, which itself is now available in a non-lethal option, and they make it possible to finish the game without using any handheld weapons, which is nice I guess.Oh, and then there's Breach mode, which is now free sooo... doesn't really contribute to my overall sentiment towards MD. It does add some unique new mechanics and looks pretty cool in a Tron-like way, but again... free. Also microtransactions.Finally, this game has some serious bugs - be careful with the inventory screen because often, attempting to customise a weapon from it causes the game to crash to desktop. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why this happens, and often attempting to customise the same weapon that caused the crash before, causes another crash - the only fix is to drop that weapon from your inventory and pick it up again. Then there's the black screen issue, whereby a single pixel goes black, then the pixels around it, then all the pixels around them... etc. until the entire screen is black and the game crashes the display driver. The ""fix"" is to switch your Smart Vision augment on and then off again - but good luck doing that if you're stuck in dialog or a hacking minigame. Maybe it's only a problem with NVIDIA hardware, but it's piss poor whatever way you look at it. (Yes, I have the latest patch. No, it's not overclocking or corrupted drivers.)To conclude: on its own, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is a good game, especially if you enjoy stealth. Unfortunately its predecessor Human Revolution is a great game, which makes it difficult to recommend this one unless you're a HR veteran looking for more of the same. If you're looking to start with the Deus Ex series, HR is better and cheaper. play that first before deciding whether you want to buy this.And seriously, Square Enix? You want me to purchase mission DLC that probably should've been part of the full game? As if the microtransactions and single-use items weren't enough? Stop trying to milk this franchise and get out of Eidos' way.";0;120,5;13/04/2017;566;13;;2.0
29;Action; 124,99;"MASSIVE LET DOWN Ok, so I pre-ordered DXMD and completed it on ""Give Me Deus Ex"" level along with all side missions within just 2 days of release. After I completed it I uninstalled it and didn't bother writing a review as they were already negative and explaned the issues fully. I really wanted to enjoy this game, as I have had great fun in Human Revoulution and for most of my playthrough I was having fun. However this game ended up being a great let down to me and I'll tell you why... Pros: + Beautiful Visuals & effects+ Smooth/fluid gameplay & controls+ Great ambient theme & soundtrack+ Immersive environment+ Good sound design (apart from gun sounds)From the above you are probably wondering why this is getting a bad review, but the thing is this game lacks severly in major areas. I want to get this one off my chest quickly. Deus Ex games have always had multiple ""hubs"", where you can roam around environments freely, exploring, recieving quests and buying items. However DXMD only has 1 hub, which ruins the global travel theme shown in the games before it.... and ooohhhh boy the worst part about this game is the embarrasing lack of content. I don't blame the developers at all, it seems like Square Enix had just cut large amounts out of the game to pump out later as dlc. This games story was great for the first 5 hours of gameplay, however it turned to litteral ♥♥♥♥ afterwards. I have seen Call Of Duty pull off better stories than this, honestly it is less than half the length of the story in DXHR and it certainly wasn't quality over quantity. One thing they advertised and hyped up, was the supposedly ""important"" decision making, but it ended up being almost non-existent. Instead of your choices being reflected in gameplay, it only changes what is shown on Picus News near the end of the game. THE ENDING IS LITERALLY YOUR CHOICES IN THE STORY BEING READ BACK TO YOU BY PICUS NEWS , no joke it has to be the worst ending they could have possibly come up with lmao. I cannot recommend this game at full price, maybe if it's under £10 you should buy, infact I would wait for a directors cut version where they give you the content they took in the first place. A massive let down to DX fans, everyone would prefer Human Revolution, buy that instead if you get the chance.I'm also worried people will be fooled into buying this game as they keep dropping prices for the main game & DLCs. Please don't give into the fact that it's a Deus Ex game and it has to be good... I did so and I regret it. Soon enough it and the season pass, as well as probably a Directors Cut edition will be released at a much lower price. These price drops, and the introduction of Breach being free-to-play show that Square-Enix is bent on trying to squeeze as much money out of this game as they possibly can.";0;44,5;29/01/2017;1103;27;;2.0

29;Action; 124,99;"It's an almost surreal experience to be writing a negative review for a Deus Ex game, after having invested countless hours in the series and enjoying them immensely (The Fall notwithstanding), but here we are. I will try to keep this short and sweet.The game is awesome, the trademark Deus Ex feeling of having many possible pathways to solving a problem is there, the character customization is there, the great worldbuilding and lore is there (including references and callbacks to the series as whole), the excellent characters are there, and the gameplay itself is very similar to the one of Human Revolution (Which was top notch), and even improved in some areas. In short, the game is a treat and if you liked Human Revolution, you will certainly love Mankind Divided.Now you will be thinking ""But what is the problem? How come the game is reviewed negatively if it has so much going for it?""The fatal flaw lies in the story. Not even the quality of the story itself, but that the game is clearly cut in half, in what has to be one of the worst cases of executive meddling I have ever seen, because I refuse to believe this is how it was intended from the beginning. The ending is a coitus interruptus in game form.To put it more graphical terms (Spoilers for DX: HR coming), imagine you are playing Human Revolution, and after killing Barret, you are shown a cinematic of Adam talking to Sarif about him going to Hengsha to continue his investigation, and then the credits start to roll (30 minutes of unskippable credits, mind you, just to rub more salt in the wound).And to add further insult to injury, two of the secondary missions in Detroit are sold as a separate DLC (Which clearly seems they were ripped from the main content), plus an extra hyper bland game mode topped off with microtransactions and lootboxes. Completely disgusting.Deus Ex is a franchise that has a very dear place in my heart and while I certainly enjoyed the story and would like to know how it continues, I cannot abide these despicable commercial practices.

30;Action; 139,90;Resident Evil that we deserve. Capcom. I have only one question. When we should expect Resident Evil 3: Nemesis Remake?;1;23,8;29/01/2019;1309;62;;0.0
30;Action; 139,90;This game is what other developers should aspire to when creating a remake. It is hands down the best remake I have ever played.I remember getting this game for my birthday in third grade and my little brother watched me play for what felt like an eternity. That sparked my brothers' obsession with the resident evil franchise. I, however, did not play much of the following titles in the series. I would watch him here and there and watched the movies. I ended up getting an Xbox and Halo was my obsession. With the remake of the third one and RE: Village on the way I figured it was finally time for me to really wet my whistle with what Capcom has to offer. This game is by far more terrifying than anything I remember playing in third grade. Parts in the original that have been implanted into my cerebral cortex out of sheer terror back then have now manifested themselves into brand new nightmares thanks to the modern revamp of the games engine with the graphics being some of the most realistic horrors I've seen even in Hollywood movies. I'm on my third or fourth playthrough and I still scream like a little girl at parts. The game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrifying. Between lickers popping out of vents, the 15-foot terminator known as Mr. X chasing you all over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ place, zombies behind doors, in lockers to WHATEVER THE HELL those things in the sewers are... it's enough to give you a glimpse into quite possibly, what Hell is. Iconic cutscenes, boss introductions, and other favoritable parts have been altered or changed in a way that keeps the game fresh but still so grounded to its core roots. Giving new players a great and new experience while giving the veteran players something to smile at in nostalgia. Perhaps one of my favorite things in this game is the dismemberment. Really gives you that dead space sense of cutting your enemies down to a meat sack of nothing before pumping a few more rounds into their heads to make sure they're not getting back up. The only thing I wish this game had was more content. Yes, I know there are bonus missions but that still is not enough. I just want more. Sadly,  the RE3 remake ain't it.

31;Action; 99,90;"I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. What more could you want?";1;1238,7;13/06/2020;756;18;;10.0
31;Action; 99,90;Most enjoyable grind everI’m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers. ProsGood graphicsA lot of contentVery challengingA lot of monsters to huntNo p2w crapNice coopConsPerformance could be slightly betterWhile there are a lot of monsters, many of them feel too similar to each otherMy curator page;1;106,9;6/06/2019;550;20;;8.0
31;Action; 99,90;Edit: Just an update on this review. After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.Previous Review:This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game.;1;388,0;23/03/2021;1281;11;;10.0

31;Action; 99,90;I'm in my mid 40's so I don't always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter: World has me hooked. Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun.;1;103,6;21/08/2019;538;13;;10.0
31;Action; 99,90;Now that this game has gotten a resurgence, here's a PSA.There's something called the Defender's Set in the beginning of the game. Now MH does nothing to explain it but it is basically endgame quality gear blueprint given to everyone in the forge from the beginning of the game. It's basically a means for players to speedrun their way through the game to reach Iceborne, the expansion. Literally speedrunning because the weapons do so much damage that it negates every reason to interact with basically every mechanic in the game. Monster weaknesses, equipment types, literally any reason to pop open the hunter guide, look at what a monster is weak to, where its weakness is, and what elements might help. All of this is useless with the Defender Set. Farming materials to make the next tier of gear, progressively getting stronger and basically interacting with the ladder of equipment or crafting as a whole is negated as well.If you want to play Monster Hunter with all its features, don't use the Defender Set. Because in the end the game is about the journey, not the destination. Learning how to be a monster hunter, and how to hunt well for your class is exceptionally fun in this game.But by all means if you want to breeze through this game, blowing past the entire base game just to reach the expansion where you'll most definitely get your ass kicked because you don't know the mechanics of the game, go ahead. In the end you're either learning the game in the beginning, or learning the game in the end. Benefits of learning the game in the beginning is that you have more content. Negatives of learning the game later is that you just wasted the base game away for no reason.;1;30,7;31/12/2023;743;12;;5.0
31;Action; 99,90;"If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!";1;867,8;9/11/2018;780;25;;8.0

32;Action; 99,90;Quick SummaryDevil May Cry 5 (DMC5) is an excellent game that has a very in-depth combat and skills, along with a high skill ceiling. It also sports gorgeous visuals thanks to the RE engine, and various characters that all play differently and keep the whole thing feeling fresh. Environments are varied with hidden secrets, challenges, and alternative routes. The cutscenes are just as high quality as the gameplay itself, with a variety of interesting characters and interesting twists. ProsFantastic graphics and visualsGreat optimizationAn absolute banger of a soundtrack, that fits the game perfectlyHuge variety of enemies and bossesVery in-depth combat system with tons of skills and weapons to unlock and upgradeInteresting story with unique and memorable charactersHighly replay-ableCons One character is very simplistic to play  For new comers, the skills and different characters can be overwhelming Some of the combat arenas become predictable Any key skips a cutscene with no warning (including tab + shift for steam overlay)  Camera angle with keyboard and mouse is often jankyStory*No Spoilers* DMC5 has a pretty interesting story that most players will appreciate after having played the previous games. However, for newcomers, it’s still fairly easy to follow as the game has a fairly lengthy introductory cutscene, along with gradual tutorials that also give you lore at the same time. All of the characters are well developed and playing as different ones at varying times in the story adds a lot to the experience as well. Having plenty of cutscenes was a nice change of pace from all the murder and mayhem, as fun as that was. Overall, the story in DMC is very well done and ties into the old games, but is still accessible to newcomers (though players would benefit from watching a synopsis at least).  GameplayThis is where the meat of this game is. And also, where you will take a lot of meat out of demons (because hey, they deserve it). The gameplay in DMC5 is smooth, brutal, and requires fast reflexes. It feels like riding a roller coaster that you’re not wearing a seat belt on… increasingly exciting and invigorating, but if you lose control and thus your groove, you will be punished. One additional note is that the game seems to encourage multiple playthroughs, since you cannot unlock everything the first time through and you unlock additional modes or further upgrades upon your first campaign completion. The gameplay can roughly be divided into a few categories, though with some overlap: Combat, Skills, Items, and Exploration.The combatThe combat in DMC5 is essentially third person hack and slash with lots of different combos or skills you can utilize. A very important fact to keep in mind is that combat varies greatly between characters as well, so you can expect a large amount of variety. The battles primarily take place inside a locked arena (similar to Doom 2016) which means there is truly no escape, and you must fight to the death. There are a few roaming enemies throughout the course of the game but most of the battles are very focused, intentional events. Correctly making combo moves and switching up attack styles quickly results in a higher score in your missions, with the highest being “SSS”. Most combat consists of a primary attack using some sort of melee weapon (like a sword or fists), with a secondary attack that is often ranged (like a revolver or shotgun). Another important element is the “lock-on” feature that lets you concentrate on a specific enemy, and which also acts as a modifier for certain attacks. In addition, enemy attacks can often be countered or dodged with the correct time and combination of keys.  SkillsBranching out from these basic attacks, are skills and movements you can unlock that all can be affected by different keys or buttons. A single primary attack can be totally different by simply using your forward action or reverse action, or holding lock on with a movement key. The upgrade system really goes insanely in-depth here, providing the player the opportunity to really experiment and find the skills they enjoy. Skills are unlocked with red orbs which are essentially in-game currency, that is dropped from kills and can also be found scattered throughout the maps. As the game progresses, a lot of new and different ultimate skills can be unlocked, that push the combat ability to the max. Depending on the character, some truly devastating powers can be unleashed that knock all but the most powerful demons into bits. These ultimate powers however take time to charge and can be replenished in various but limited ways. ItemsDMC5 also allows item utilization to aid players in beating it. For instance, there are certain orbs you can pick up that restore your health, or permanently upgrade it. One orb will revive you on the spot if you die in a battle. This does however reduce your score level in the mission. There are various weapons and items you can select from before you start a mission, essentially customizing your loadout.ExplorationFinally, exploration actually plays a pretty significant part in DMC5. For all the vicious combat and lively action, there is a surprising amount of hidden secrets that reveal extra missions or items. Also, there are a few small environmental puzzles that you need to figure out to progress, but they are nothing complicated. Often times, exploration will really help with future battles since you can find important upgrades or even replenish health before a boss.Graphics and VisualsGraphics and optimization are where DMC5 really shines. The character faces and animations are impeccable, and the environments are detailed with fantastic atmosphere. The combat is only made better because of this, as there is nothing quite like seeing high resolution demon blood flying across the screen! SoundDMC5 has very well-designed audio, with lots of audio cues and combat that provides plenty of feedback. The only audio-related aspect that really stood out in a good way, was the soundtrack. DMC5 frankly has an amazing soundtrack, with really memorable tracks that fit perfectly to the high intensity combat. Another cool detail is the music intensity increases with the score the player racks up during combat. I still find myself playing the songs after completing the game and headbanging along with them.Bugs, Glitches and CrashesI did experience one bug with the game. After using Steam overlay, a couple times the game wouldn’t fully recognize my input and so I couldn’t move or switch weapons. I had to reload a checkpoint to get around this. Another technical complaint I have is that the cutscenes will skip with the press of any key, so keep your fingers off the keyboard if you want to watch the cutscenes. However, you CAN re-watch cutscenes from the main menu. Price… is it worth it?DMC5 is currently listed at $59.99, which is typical for a newer AAA game. For true fans of the DMC franchise, this price is easily worth it because of how re-playable the game is and a decently long campaign. For newcomers such as myself, I got the game on the most recent sale for $19 which was definitely a bargain for the high-quality experience.ConclusionIn conclusion, DMC5 seems to be a nearly flawless addition to the DMC franchise with lots of fluid and technical combat, an intense story, and absolutely gorgeous visuals. For someone completely new to the franchise and even to the genre, it is worth picking up on sale and obliterating some demons.

33;Action; 84,00;All the frustration of a freemium game economy, whilst still having to pay a traditional game's up front costs. I got this game on sale, and still honestly feel ripped off. With the base version of the game, the majority of the the content is hidden behind a pay wall. Including most importantly the characters, I would be fine if it was just cosmetics, but over half the cast is inaccessible (don't even get me started on the stages, music, cosmetics etc). Was genuinely shocked to discover that Capcom's reaction to people's frustration with how slow in game currency was earnt at release, was to cut income even further! now the only way to get fight money (the in game currency), is through levelling up, or from online matches. The online matches give you 50 fight money for a win, for context to unlock a character is 100,000......yeah (new stages are 70,000, costumes are 40,000). That should tell you everything about the game's economy you need to know. The sad thing is the game itself is pretty good, what little you get to play of it anyway. I have loved street fighter since I first played SF2 in the arcades.But what capcom did with SF5 has really soured my view of any future involvement with the series. This is all obviously done in a cynical attempt to squeeze more money out of their costumers (who again have already paid for the base game), but i'm not spending another penny on this game, this anti consumer BS needs to end.;0;603,6;3/12/2018;1426;16;;1.0

33;Action; 84,00;After many hours, a great number of ranked matches and late night lobbies, and a couple local tournaments, I can finally say confidently that I do not recommend this game.The singleplayer content is barebones and not at all worth playing. This is fine in a competitive fighting game, since the focus is more on competitive multiplayer. If you're not interested in that, take a hard pass on Street Fighter V and play a fighting game with worthwhile singleplayer content. Guilty Gear Xrd is a good one.Mechanically, the game isn't bad at all. It's fairly simple, with a modest amount of easy to understand mechanics that lead to interesting gameplay. It's also popular, so you can always find people online to play with. It's not a difficult game to pick up, and it's more accessible and rewarding than most other fighting games. That said, I still have a few problems with the gameplay.Namely:* Defensive options are awful. This is why high level play is just watching people do meaty setups on eachother. It's also why throw loops are as prevalent as they are.* Questionable design decisions, such as removing frame 1 invuln from all meterless DPs. This really skews the risk/reward of those moves, which is an odd choice from a game franchise that's so rooted in pure and simple fighting game fundamentals.* Timing is sort of strange. It's a game with 3 frame normals, so things like blockstrings and meaty attacks need to be pretty airtight. If they're not (and it's hard for them to be with any sort of network stutter in the mix) then mashing light buttons will get you out of a lot of situations. This should be a bad habit, but it's rewarding in this game for some reason.* The input delay/netcode makes it feel pretty unresponsive. If you're coming from other fighting games, expect to get hit by many fullscreen moves (Balrog's rush punches, Cammy's EX spiral arrow, Ken's EX tatsu) if you don't block preemptively.In terms of everything aside from the gameplay, it's an inexcusable travesty. The netcode is terrible, and even on wired connections with people in my own hometown it feels jerky and frustrating. Other fighting games add input delay, or seem to run the game in slow motion. SFV just teleports you from one connected attack to the next so you can watch yourself die in a jerky mess of unreactable attacks. The netcode also seems to send all the lag to the person with better internet. I remember having a really good night on ranked with seemingly stable connections and slow witted opponents, only to later realize I had been torrenting and my sister had been watching Netflix, presumably sending all the lag to my opponents.Unlocking characters, costumes, colors, and stages requires either making microtransactions with real world money, or spending ingame currency, which is extremely limited and for the most part non-renewable. You get 50 fight money for a win in a ranked match, zero for a loss. Characters cost 100,000 fight money each. You do the math. All the good cosmetics in this game are behind paywalls that you'd expect to see in free to play games. But it's a full price triple-A title, and the character season passes are also inexcusably expensive.Capcom has been pretty terrible with supporting this game as well. Patches are frequently delayed by weeks if not months, and it's missing many quality of life changes that should have been included at time of release (eg. saving battle lounge settings when the game closes, or being able to skip the awful tutorial on a fresh install). They also straight up lied about a Linux release. That was supposed to happen concurrent with the Windows release, but there has been no word from Capcom on that front.I could go on. There's been a very long train of disappointments with this game, and you shouldn't hop on it. Maybe they'll release Super Street Fighter V as the rumors say, and then I'll give this review another revision, but I don't see things changing for the better. The game is still going to be expensive, laggy, and unsatisfying. But it's got a lot of players, so it's got that going for it.Crossplay is very nice though. I wish more fighting games had that.;0;168,0;18/07/2017;222;2;;2.0

34;Action; 99,90;"(Played through on Superhero Mode)Without wasting any time, if you are a Mega Man fan, you probably already have the game. If you haven't played Mega Man before, or aren't certain if you will enjoy it, the selectable difficulty modes really open up the game to first-timers so you can continuously retry without running out of chances, so don't fret.(Length)The stages are heavily based on the NES styled titles, with large rooms and unique gimmicks. There are 8 Main Stages, 2 Wily Stages, a simple Boss Capsule Refight Stage, and a short ride to the Final Battle. There is no intro stage in this game, which is a minor disappointment. The total amount of content is brisk, so if you know what you are doing, expect to complete the game in a few hours, tops.The extra modes pad out the content a little, but the entire point of this game is to challenge yourself. You can get a lot of replay value out of trying to play the game without using special weapons or the gear system, essentially replaying the same content with restrictions to unlock achievements or self improvement.(Balance)There are only two areas I can recall where you get trapped into taking a hit, one in Blastman's stage, and one in Impact Man's. Unless you have foresight, you will likely take a hit there. Thankfully, there is no such forced hit involving instant death. All falling blocks and spikes are clearly telegraphed, and any player skillful enough can feasibly avoid such obstacles without unfair deaths.E-Tank Spam trivializes a lot of the difficulty on all modes, but especially the easier ones, due to the sheer amount of bolts that drop. E-Tanks only cost 100 bolts a pop, and you can walk out of a stage with 1000+ if you pick up every drop. You simply never run out of these things, which means most of the game can be beaten by standing on top of bosses and tanking the damage while you burn the bosses down, chugging E-Tanks every so often. This is only a problem if you choose to use this form of recovery, though.Everything felt great playing Buster Only, so if you are interested in a playthrough without powers or special weapons, look forward to an excellent challenge.(Weapons)The special weapons in this game are easily among the most powerful in a long line of games. They have very generous hitboxes and have enormous utility, making almost all of them a pure upgrade over your default buster. Power Gear toggling just to wipe the screen with overwhelming special weapons feels extremely nice.In addition, there is a new option to change your special weapons with the right control stick. It has never been easier to utilize these things.(Soundtrack)Although music is a very subjective thing, I have to say that I found the vast majority of the soundtrack to be utterly forgettable. This is very much a soundtrack made for a newer age, and felt much more modernized than ever before. You won't find the same level of catchy melodies as any of the past Mega Man titles. None of the music is outright bad, but it pains you much moreso when the series is known for such well made music and you end the experience without any of the tunes stuck in your head.(Final Notes)The game is short and sweet. There are really just 10 meaty stages with a few extra short walks to the final bosses. You will get your money's worth if you decide to try the higher difficulties or want to play the side modes, but they are more of the same. If you enjoy challenging yourself, grab this for sure. If you are more of a ""variety"" gamer and will only play this once, you might only get 3-5 hours out of it, so do keep that in mind.If you want to see this series prosper, you really owe it to yourself to support the Blue Bomber so that his games may continue. The sales are essentially votes, so vote with your wallet! Welcome back, buddy. MIssed ya.";1;33,6;2/10/2018;77;1;;7.0

34;Action; 99,90;A lot better than i expected it to be.There's really only two complaints i have with this game:The music isn't as spectacular as everyone hoped.  Mega Man games have routinely had top notch exceptional music soundtracks, every song being an instant classic.  In this one however the music is very forgettable and almost unnoticeable in comparison.  That being said there is many music conversion packs people have created and will create to rectify this problem (The most recent one i tried was the 8-bit version)..The only other complaint i have is minor, in that it's hard to tell where Mega Man's hit box is so jumping in tight areas like Torch Man stage gets a little frustrating, but you can get use to that.Also, there's really only 2 full Wily stages (not including Wily and the re-fights), but all the robot master levels are longer than normal so it kind of makes up for it.  Still a bit of a disappointment when you get there, but it's not a huge deal.  One more Wily level probably would have done the trick.Overall, very nicely done.  Might be controversial, but I might even consider it to be in the top 5 if not top 3 best classic Mega Man games (classic meaning 1-11 not including the X or Zero series, which i have actually not played yet).------------------------------Control Scheme I Used:Gamepad defaults with D-Pad for movement.  May have rebound auto fire button.------------------------------Worth the current price (CDN$ 39.99)?  This might be a hard sell, even fans of Mega Man.What I actually paid: $31.99------------------------------Completionist Review:DLC Achievements:  NoneRating:  There's a fair bit of workCan be completed in one run:  No, there's challenges and things outside the main game.Chapter Select: Kind of, you can pick the level order, and which challenges to start.Did I need/use a guide?  No.Lots of things to get here for achievements, including a speedrun, which took a couple attempts.  Overall lots of fun though really, and the challenges are different and interesting for the most part.;1;63,8;22/11/2018;38;1;;7.0
34;Action; 99,90;Summary: They got it right!Mega Man 11 is a revival of the 30 (or 31 if you're from Japan) year old series, and it seriously seems like they listened to fan input along the way. Mega Man regains all of his core moves: running and jumping, but also sliding and charge shot. In addition, if you wish to use the gears, you absolutely can. They enhance your speed and your weapons, but overall they make the game easier. You can actually beat the full game buster only, and that's one of the areas in which they were clearly listening to the fans.The controls are tight as ever, though bear in mind that using a wireless controller or analog stick will not effectively replicate the feel of the classic series in its prime. Thankfully, there is generic gamepad support, even though it uses Xbox button icons to represent said gamepad's buttons and can get confusing. Want to play on an SNES controller? No problem -- I finished the game doing so! You'll need a couple more buttons to use everything, however.Of note, Mega Man's jump distance has been increased by around 25%, likely to facilitate the switch to widescreen. Aside from that, however, it'll feel more like playing Mega Man 4 or 5 than any other title.The graphics are beautiful, though the perspectives used in cutscenes are a bit limited. Obviously core gameplay should lock it as is done, but cutscenes don't need to be beholden to these limitations. The audio is catchy as ever, though default settings really drown out its wonderful soundtrack. I'd recommend adjusting the voices and SFX down a bit before beginning.If you're worried about replayability, challenges have you covered. The developers made good use of the fairly short roster of maps to design some clever, if not incredibly evil challenges. Getting gold on them will keep you busy for quite some time.A few people have mentioned slowdown issues similar to those experienced in the Legacy Collections. Luckily, I didn't experience this, in spite of having slowdown in LC2 and XLC1. It seems to be fairly rare.That aside, with the difficulty vets expect and the easier difficulty settings making it accessible to newcomers, this is a fantastic run-and-gun for anyone.(also, I will throw my money at any Bass DLC Capcom shoves at me);1;24,7;3/10/2018;51;2;;8.0

34;Action; 99,90;Mega Man 11Rock em, sock emReviewAfter an eight year absence, I am happy to report that Mega Man 11 succeeds, but there are a few caveats. Let's be honest: it wouldn't take much for Mega Man 11 to not succeed in the eyes of the fans when you are springboarding off 2003's lacklustre, dead-in-it's tracks Mega Man X7 (which tried to transition the series into 3D with disastrous results), which only ended up taking the franchise to new levels of low that nearly saw the blue bomber tumble into notoriety with fans himself. The follow-up, Mega Man X8, didn't do much to elevate the franchise out of the muck within which it had found itself, with X8 never rising above mediocre. Many of us fans thought Mega Man was on his way to the retirement village to be sunsetted by Capcom after the throwback Mega Man 10 was released in 2010 feeling like a cash-in. The years long radio silence after that only further made it seem like Capcom had no clear path forward for the blue bomber and  fans started to wonder whether the franchise was finally on life support.I will admit, as a huge fan of the late eighties originals of which Mega Man 2 is the high point, the return announcement in 2017 did catch me off guard. With creator Keiji Inafune now having moved on from Capcom, how could Capcom ever do without Inafune guiding the series back to life? Although we would soon all learn that Inafune's best days were probably behind him too after Mighty No. 9 failed to emerge successfully from under the shackles of the Mega Man franchise, ending up an inferior product in almost every conceivable way from from mascot, to robot bosses, to world, and finally extended to the villain. The next question was with Inafune gone, could Capcom ever make the blue bomber relevant again?Sadly, no as it seems like the days of Mega Man's relevance have long passed and are now assigned to history for keeping. When we first met him in 1987, platformers were the rock star's of gaming. They sold systems by virtue of the mascot alone  Now you would be lucky to find a big publisher willing to fund one outside of Nintendo. While the genre did have a bit of a resurgence in the early noughties when they went 3D and became gobbledegook collectathons, its mostly fallen to indie studios to keep the genre alive and quite frankly they have been doing a sterling job. Just look at some of the crazy and wonderful things with the genre they have been doing (Super Meat Boy and Celeste are classic examples of this). In many ways it kind of feels like the game succeeds by virtue of simply existing, especially for us fans starved of his presence but Capcom does a fairly good job of taking the series and modernising some of its mechanics but that is where it stops because the rest of the formula remains untouched from the original game - a blueprint that has been subsequently adhered to rigidly throughout the long running series. This legacy design that the series keeps on insisting including is now starting to feel more than a little archaic, ensuring there are very little to no surprises with each new release. It's at the point now where its become the franchises Achilles heel. You won't find any platforming moments of brilliance here, like the kinds of stuff on display in Celeste or Hollow Knight. It plays it very safe and is clearly made for long standing fans of the series, as if Capcom knew it was treading on thin ice with them.If you were never much of a fan of the series, then Mega Man 11 is going to do little, if anything, to turn that around. Another thing I must mention is that it is also insanely hard, and that is probably going to drive a lot of people away. I had to drop it from normal difficulty (which is advised for mainstays of the series which I consider myself) to easy mode and I still struggled like mad to make headway with it. The first three Mega Man games are considered to be amongst the hardest games ever created, yet I could clear Mega Man 1/2 and Mega Man 3 in a single sitting back in the day while typing text messages to my dentist and doing tax calculations for my tax return. Yet here I couldn't even get through a single level of repeated trying in the five or so hours I banged my head against the normal difficulty before resigning myself to the fact that I must now officially be an old fart who has to play on baby settings.As a fan I appreciate that Capcom has brought Mega Man back from the dead and I appreciate the graphical update to modern HD graphics. Mega Man has never looked more clearer although I would love to see the series return back to its pixel roots, BUT when I say pixel, I am speaking along the lines of the gorgeous indie platform Kings and Queens of our current era (Celeste, Blasphemous or even better yet Children of Morta which has these incredibly highly detailed pixel counts that look utterly gorgeous) and not the 8-bit revival of Mega Man 10. The reality here is that Mega Man 11 is not the return to form sequel many would have you believe. It's enjoyable but it's also not enjoyable to play in equal measure and is not one of his better adventures. I also found the eight Dr. Wily robots you need to defeat a little underwhelming from a mechanics and design standpoint. If Capcom is to continue Mega Man's adventures into the future, then I certainly hope they look into the history of the most celebrated and beloved platformers of our modern era that have all, almost exclusively, sprung from the indie scene because that is where Mega Man's true innovation and salvation lies. There is no point in trying to revive his best days. Let history keep record of those.One word or phrase to sum up the experienceFor the fansPerformance/Bug related incidentsNone, should run easily on most hardware as the game is not demanding on CPU or GPU.Similar to gamesMega Man 2, Celeste, Might No. 9Rating ★★★★★★★☆☆☆https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869453510;1;25,6;7/04/2021;44;1;;5.0

36;Strategy; 99,90;So this game is quite an interesting one. I played and attempted it several times since I own and love X-Com Enemy Within. It bested me each time and left me in quite a seething rage at points. I decided to give it another go with the War of The Chosen expansion coming and I have to say that this game did finally win me over. This game can be brutally hard to you. It really expects you to take your time and think about your moves for the first half of the game. You get a little more leeway once you get to the second half and you have some vetern soldiers and their abilities. Let me address the most controversial topic first, the mission timers.        Coming from EW I hated them and it felt like they were everywhere. Having finally beaten the game I can say that it's roughly 50% of the missions are timed and I really came to enjoy them. They change up the primary tactic of move, overwatch and they make sense thematically.  I only lost one mission with them and that was my fault of not planning properly. There are mods on the workshop that alter them but I think you should give them a go as the developers intended first. They create a great sense of tension and you really have to evaluate your moves each turn. I love optimizing stuff and this really became great fun once I got the hang of them. Just expect to lose a few times while you learn how those missions play out.       For those of you new to the Xcom series just know that these games run a reverse difficulty curve, they are hard in the beginning and get easier as the game progresses. Most the difficulty also comes from not knowing really where to begin. The game does not do a great job of making things clear to you. I did have to watch some videos and do some reading to really get a good grasp of the game. Also it doesn't make it clear what negative effects come from not attempting missions. I got a mission for a supply raid which I didn't attempt and the aliens ended up recapturing that territory. I didn't expect that and it wasn't communicated to me that that would be the result. The game likes to omit other valuable tacital data as well so I highly recommend the following mods:Stop Wasting My TimeShow Health ValuesPatrol When RevealedPerfect InformationGotchaThey save time in game but reducing certain animations and they really help you make informed moves each turn. I feel like Gotcha is a must have and something the developers should've included in the game to begin with. I'd also recommend some the communties mod map packs so you avoid getting 'familiar' maps. I also personally like It's Just A Scratch just because I think armor should actually protect you not just increase your health.          This game ran smooth as butter the entire time with a couple of exceptions. When I destroyed lots of objects all at once and a couple times in the final mission. Otherwise I got a steady 60 fps and load times were between 5-30 seconds. It does have some minor bugs. The most frequent one I would get is where I would click on an ability and the character would instantly do it. Very annoying when I needed my last grenade for something useful. Also sometimes the character models can get inside of each other. Visually jarring but the game still treats them as being on seperate squares so not game breaking.          Would I recommend you buy it? Absolutely, so long as you are ok losing a few times to learn the game. It's a fantastic strategy game and one of my personal favorites. What really got me with this game was how truly fair it actually did seem. Even in the face of overwhelming odds, smart tactical play saved me many times and it felt very rewarding. Honestly this game reminds me of dark souls a lot. It isn't just about the stats of your in game characters, it's about the knowledge you gain as well.

36;Strategy; 99,90;A sequel to the amazing XCOM: Enemy Unknown. XCOM 2 expands on it's predecesor in nearly every fashion. Strategy is deeper, the customization is deeper, and the layers of story that you build with your squad is as great as well have come to expect from the series. One of the biggest complaints that I hear are the mission timers. Thankfully, the developers at Firaxis have intergrated their own mod tools into the game to support modding, something the last game lacked. With these mods, you can disable those pesky timers, add customization options, or take yourself for a ride in the thrilling Long War 2;1;261,1;22/06/2017;433;15;;10.0
36;Strategy; 99,90;"TLDR:XCOM 2 is a pretty great turn-based strategy game about killing aliens. You command a platoon of customizable soldiers that begin as rookies and over time become seasoned veterans with skills dictated by your decisions in skill trees. There is a fair variety of alien villains that you will encounter in map missions to keep you on your toes. The game features certain hardcore gameplay elements such as soldiers permanently dying if they are not recovered/are abandoned during missions and an opt-in ironman mode where you only play with one save data. Be wary of common RNG shenanigans such as missing shots that are predicted at 90%+ accuracy. XCOM 2 also has a large variety of mods available in the Steam Workshop. would highly recommend players to check those out on subsequent playthroughs.GENRE:Turn-based strategy, base & troop management, killing aliensGAMEPLAY:There are two main portions of the game. Firstly, game missions are the more active half where you command a number of soldiers through a map chunk with an objective to complete such as to kill all aliens, destroy a target, or rescue a key personnel. You command troops through the grid-based map and take actions based on the number of action points they possess each turn. these actions include movement, use weapon (fire gun, melee), reload, use items, and go on overwatch (aka set up an ambush if an enemy enters line of sight). Your troops gain experience for taking part in missions and killing enemies.The second half of the game is the base and troop management. Outside of the missions, you are tasked with upgrading your base of operations by commanding the research team to discover new tech that you can employ such as base upgrades and new weapons and engineering new troop upgrades like usable items in the field and improved armor. There is a ""calendar"" portion of this section in that your actions need to counter the enemy alien activity. if the alien activity reaches a certain point by a given deadline, your game will automatically end. In the beginning it is pretty easy to lower the enemy's activity progress but it gets more difficult as the game goes on. Therefore, you need to strategically decide which missions you want to accept. do you want to get more money so you can buy more necessary supplies or do you want to complete a mission to give yourself more time and lower the enemy's activity bar?GRAPHICS:XCOM 2 maps range from narrow city streets to quiet forest encounters and snowy bases. In particular missions, the alien bases look very high tech and are equipped with incredible weaponry. XCOM 2 can be a bit demanding in the graphics/performance department. The game has improved/enhanced visuals compared to XCOM: Enemy Unknown as soldiers, aliens, and overall map environments all have higher textures/details. STORY:XCOM 2 takes place in a time after the conclusion of the previous game XCOM: Enemy Unknown (you don't need to have played XCOM:EU to play XCOM 2). The aliens have assumed supreme power over the human race, and a covert operation is being run to find the commander (the player) in order to fight back against the alien menace. Will you be able to take back humanity from the alien hoard?STRENGTHS:•Gameplay in the missions feels good and pretty fair. You need to strategically move your soldiers around the maps to gain as much advantage as you can in order to minimize the potential losses as much as possible. This can be done by utilizing cover, gaining height advantage for increased accuracy, and setting up overwatch points to obliterate enemies before they discover you. •Soldier customization is a nice feature: you can customize all of your soldiers including their names, nationalities/voices, their appearance, their names, and even their biographies if you are so inclined. This can give you a form of immersive attachment to your troops in that you can view your dead soldiers' summaries while at your base (RIP to all of your future rookies). •The game can be as challenging as you want it to be: easy enough to breeze through and experience the game quickly, or very hard & ironman mode to completely test your strategy RPG skills. •There are a lot of mods available on the Steam workshop. These include new soldier customizations, UI changes, new weapons, new classes, and more. However, be sure to distinguish if mods require DLC or not (e.g. some mods require War of the Chosen (WOTC)). WEAKNESSES:•RNG can be a coin toss at times. A shot could say that you have a 96% chance of hitting, but then the shot misses and you are left wondering just what the heck happened. It's not a common occurrence, but it can happen enough to be noticeable. •You can't save scum your actions. if your shot misses you can't quickload your last save and try again to get a different result.•Last time I played, I remember there were some long loading screens right before a mission began.NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):9/10The game is an easy recommend for players who enjoy other strategy RPG games like the Fire Emblem series. There is a fair amount of content to play with, and killing aliens is always a good time.  Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. ""Let's be honest, I only wrote this review for awards"" is a waste of everyone's time.

37;Simulation;00,00;"It would honestly be fair to call 2K an evil company at this point. There are only two options. either the company is staffed solely by incompetent developers who are incapable of creating a functioning game OR, much more likely, they knowingly, annually, decide to tighten the screws of their monopoly around the heads of literally millions of kids who shell out billions of dollars in revenue to this company every year.We can talk about rampant cheating, abysmal AI, or the horrific optimization that is sure to make even a beginer-level programmer cry himself to sleep. I, however, think it is much more interesting to talk about the scam itself: to purposefully make the game unbearable throughout every facet of its gameplay. The sheer malignance of such behavor is difficult to understand for normal people, but here it is important to understand how financial incentives choke the life out of every argument for game improvements that is not bounded in optimizing the ""revenue stream.""As a monopoly 2K has no incentive to make anything ""well."" There is simply no reason to. If you like basketball simulators there is only one game to play. 2K has acknowledged this in their earnings reports before, as far as I am aware. Making the game unplayable is actually profitable. If you drip-feed as little fun and engagement to your players as humanly possible and hide even this behind as many paywalls as possible, you create the illusion that ""once you pay just a *bit* more the game will get fun,"" but it just never does. It's economics for elementary schoolers, and it works magic. It's a freemium game that you pay 60 euros for every year. A cash cow only rivaled by the Madden/FIFA franchises.The only people who get lost and stepped on in this process are all of us players, who succumb to a love of basketball every year, and every year walk away disappointed. The worst thing is that I'll probably keep playing. I'll suffer through 10-15% of every mycareer game consisting of advertisements and skippable-after-a-while cutscenes. I'll suffer through trying again and again for literally hours to get games in the rec center, only for my teammates to lag out for the 10th time, or for the entire opposing team to consist of 110-everything-with-every-badge-in-the-game hackers.

The solutions are not difficult, they are not even expensive or technically demanding, and yet they will never be implemented. It pays so much more dividends to invest in ""2KTV"" or the new look of the neighborhood. It's a slap in the face of every player, every day of every week of every month of every year. If I met any of the developers in real life I would tell them to their face that I hope everyone they've ever known are ashamed of them. And if any developers are reading this: you are working for the Monsanto of the video game industry. Every day you lie and cheat and scam is hopefully another step on your route to social leper status. Enjoy our money, and my unbridled disgust.";0;278,2;5/12/2020;2430;141;;0.0

39;Action; 169,99;"Honest review after 40 hoursI usually do not bother taking time to write reviews, but I feel like doing it this time around. I have played Mafia 3 on PC for around 40hrs now and taken my time to explore the world as well as knock off story missions. I still got a few districts and one capo to go, but I believe I have played enough to get an idea of what Mafia 3 is and what it is not.So, right off the bat, I can say that Mafia 3 is consistent. Is it consistently good? Well, no. It is not. But it does deliver a solid story-driven and consistent experience with its many shortcomings and few bright moments. As a fan of the Mafia series (and true gangster movies in general), I cannot say that I was too hyped for this edition taking us into the world of Lincoln and his story of revenge. I guess to me a perfect Mafia game would go somewhere along the lines of Mafia 2. Starting out as a piss poor Italian immigrant and working your way up in organized crime, eventually becoming a made man and having money, influence and reputation. However, I do respect the artistic direction the developers have taken by going with Lincoln and his story. It is has kept me playing for 40h, so I guess it is safe to say that is not bad. In fact, I think the story might just be the strongest element of this game.There are some other pros as well, as listed below:Weapons (and shooting) feel(s) oddly satisfying and reminiscent of some older (read: better) Hitman games.Cover system works pretty darn well.The stealth approach actually works as opposed to GTA V. So, using silenced weapons makes sense.Soundtrack is great (although it does get a bit repetitive rather soon).The environment and setting of New Orleans in this particular period seems authentic.Districts feel distinct and authentic.Cut scenes are nicely done and help flesh out the game (voice acting is actually better than I expected).Connection to real life events back in the day (news on radio, articles in Hot Rod and Playboy, depiction of racism, etc.) make the experience more immersive. That being said, as a rather demanding gamer, I would not in good conscience recommend this game to my friends! Why? Well, let us get started on the negative. Shall we?The worst PC port of any AAA game in living memory. I mean, for crying out loud, Metal Gear Solid has been a console-only franchise for almost 20 years and even they did a decent job on the port for MGS V (UI aside).Bad port leads to questionable optimization and performance issues. In max settings, it runs around 45 fps on 980ti and i5-4690k. I get better frames in both GTA V and Witcher 3 (ultra settings), for comparison. And while this game looks okay, it does not even come close to Witcher 3 in the graphics department.Graphics. Overall, it does not look bad. It is just, in this case, paradoxically inconsistent. Bayou looks gorgeous, especially during sunrise or sunset. Car models, however, leave a lot to be asked for. Especially in terms of LODs. Oh yeah.. and to say that lighting and reflections are bad would be an understatement.    Vehicle damage modelling and virtually non-existent deformation! I mean it has to be a joke right? The first Mafia had about the same level of vehicle deformation 12 freaking years ago! This is quite possibly the most disappointing aspect of this game. We are on ""next-gen"" with all this processing power, etc. and the developer was unable or unwilling to make a proper vehicle damage and deformation system for the open world game that has vehicles as one of its central elements.AI is sub-par as well. The enemy combat AI provides a lackluster challenge even on the hardest setting. Also, it does not respond at all to screaming and running civilians who should be an obvious indication that something fishy is taking place. While the NPCs manage the driving pretty well (except your gun delivery guy or cash collector girl), the pedestrians tend to be completely ignorant to the moving cars and environment around them.Game design. Eliminating the lower level gangsters and racket bosses and doing the wiretaps gets very repetitive really fast. It just lacks variety. I understand it is an open world game, but some memorable scripted missions are always great. The missions to eliminate Olivia and Lou were good. I just feel that Mafia 3 does not quite have the right balance between meaningful open world activities and high quality scripted story-telling.Intrusive HUD. If the aim is to build a nice looking open world, why on earth would you want to break the immersion with ridiculous HUD elements like the GPS ""road signs"" in Mafia 3? It is not quite as intrusive and bad of a solution as Watch Dogs had for its GPS, but it is still pretty darn disturbing. Wouldn't the GTA V-style radar-based navigation be enough?. No option to have multiple saves.Multiple CTDs and obvious bugs within the game world itself (cars driving around with open doors, enemy ragdolls getting stuck in the walls, etc).User interface in menus. Again, due to being a console port. Now to the (great) parts from the previous games that were for some unfortunate reason not included in this one:Enforcement of traffic laws by police. Getting a ticket for speeding or running a red light, made the previous Mafia games feel immersive and set them apart from GTA series. It was a nice way of interacting with the police other than getting shot by them. Back in the days of the first Mafia game, it was a cool innovation that made the player feel that the environment responded to player's actions in a realistic manner. Makes me wonder why the speedometer (another intrusive HUD element) was added to this game at all.Vehicle and clothing based search warrants. It was a nice system of how the police was able to recognize you in 2 different ways once the line of sight was lost. In this edition, you just need to get out of the ""magic"" circle and suddenly there is no interest in your crime anymore.The fuel system, while sometimes tedious, was also a nice element that increased immersion.What I feel this game is missing:More (micro)management of your conquered territories and your own organization and capos. You just give the districts to your capos and that is it! There is so much potential and replay value there that is just ignored. If only you could try to keep hold of your districts and rackets against other aspiring criminals once the main story is done, etc.I understand that Lincoln's story is that of revenge and as such he has little interest in anything else. However, once that story is done and The Marcanos are well six feet under or in the bellies of Bayou crocs, it would be nice to spend that hard earned cash on something other than weaponry (such as properties, cars, clothes, etc.). The side story of any Mafia game ought to be making money and rising up in the world and what is the point of that if there is nothing to spend it on?All in all, Mafia 3 is not a bad game, but unfortunately it is somewhat of a disappointment. Mainly because this game had so much potential, but failed to deliver in many more areas than it got right. It is missing the WOW-factor that the first Mafia game certainly had and that is generally expected from highly marketed open world games and well known franchises of this caliber. It does not excel in any single category and, as such, remains consistent in its mediocrity. The strongest elements of this game are its story-driven campaign and the authentic feel of New Orleans back in the 60s. That it does deliver. Unfortunately, these only get you so far. In spite of the nice open world, it does not seem to have a lot going for it once the story is done. For me, as a hard core fan of the 2 previous Mafia games, it is a definite let-down.";0;66,2;11/10/2016;463;5;;5.0
39;Action; 169,99;I really enjoy the game. Have played thru it numerous times. Just started back thru it again. I am probably one of the oldest PC gamers still gaming at seventy two years young.

39;Action; 169,99;It took me almost 23h but I finished it.Here's what I think about it after beating it.Pros:- Really cool atmosphere of 60s. Huge detailed city and great soundtrack add to it quite a bit.- Solid story with great characters and awesome voice acting.- Solid game mechanics - shooting, driving, cover system, etc - all works well, but there's nothing really new about them.Cons:- My biggest gripe with it - it doesn't make you feel like you are mafia- AI is pretty much brain dead. Especially if you are using stealth approach.- Repetitive samey side-quests that are forced onto you as gates to main quests- Poor optimisation (performance-wise this game sucks on most machines, even after a bunch of patches)- Little variety of cars and guns- Lots of things hidden behind unlocks that are too boring to achieve (wanna get that rocket launcher? be ready to do more side quests, if you are not sick from them yet!)- Game has a bunch of pretty meaningless unlocks, instead of giving you fun stuff (e.g. unlock to steal cars quietly, that comes after an ability to call in car delivery)- No fast travel - and since city is big, be ready to spend quite some time traveling aroundAnd in general, the game feels as if they didn't have enough time to finish the game properly.If they'd allow only doing story missions (the most fun part) and beating the game in ~6h or so - it'd be so much better in my opinion. Unfortunately, now you have to fight those boring gate-quests to get to fun stuff. Which is.. well, not fun.I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. Maybe once it's heavily discounted.See more detailed explanation of all points (along with some gameplay) in the video:https://youtu.be/S1Q84XeixcM;0;22,9;31/10/2016;303;10;;4.0

39;Action; 169,99;Pros:+Amazing soundtrack+Very well written plot and characters+The different city districts all feel unique+The cutscenes look amazingCons: -All missions (but the prologue) are the same. Rush or sneak in, kill everyone, steal something/interrogate someone/destroy something. -The weapons all feel kind of weak. A 44. Magnum should feel like a hand-cannon, not an Airsoft gun. -Most of the cutscenes are not real cutscenes, so no cinematic effects and just two characters moving their badly animated lips. -The open world looks nice, but you can't do anything but car races and missions. I can't complain about a ripoff or anything like that since I bought the game for 5 bucks, but as a fan of the original Mafia games I just feel let down. I really want to know how things will end up with Vito and the other characters, or what happened to Joe (Yes, it's revealed in this game), but it's just not worth playing through this grind-fest.

39;Action; 169,99;PROS:- First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable.- America's 60s - New Orleans...ehm..Bordeaux- America's 60s - Soundtrack!- America's 60s - Cars!CONS:- Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game.Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.Result:Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team  do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though.;0;134,7;29/12/2016;203;5;;2.0

Pros:+The story, like Mafia II's is very well written.+The facial animations in cutscenes are the only thing the game truly exceeds at.Cons:-Gameplays is needlessly dull and repetitive. You know UbiSoft towers? That optional ""content"" that was basically padded on to every Ubi open world game from 2012-15? That's this entire game essentially, yet somehow worse.-Speaking of repetitive, you literally go back to the exact same areas and do the exact same things in very short periods of time.-Something about the gunplay feels off and so does the driving.-Even on hard, the enemy AI is useless. -The lack of content that wasn't there at launch despite being shown in trailers like changeable clothes just highlights how much of an unfinished mess this was.-Despite updates to add new features and slightly improve performance, this game still full of glitches and crashes on a more than capable machine. -In general, the game looks awful. Its far more bland than the colourful screenshots used in advertisements and the games lighting in infamously abysmal.-Despite the well written story, there is so much padding between key story missions that I'd forget what was happening.

41;RPG; 199,90;"Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been ""playable"" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the ""next gen"" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.";1;145,7;16/02/2022;5241;86;;10.0

41;RPG; 199,90;"I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 2 years later... I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch. I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 1 day later...I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. ""It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,"" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.2 days later...I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam. just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. Present day... This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!Some thoughts:This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. P.S.Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.";1;73,0;28/09/2022;616;10;;10.0

42;RPG;00,00;Gwent is a card game but you can't compare it with any other cardgame out there, like Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra or Magic. It's very unique in gameplay and has almost nothing in commen with the Witcher 3 Gwent you can play with the ingame NPCs.If you play Gwent, it feels very tactical and not luck based at all compared to the others. I am a big fan of card games and I played almost every game of this genre. Nothing kept me playing it like Gwent does, even after years. This game is very well made. The grafics and the animated cards espcally, but even the gameplay is very balanced und fluid. If you already played few online card games, you probably know you have to pay alot of money to get good decks, but not here. In Gwent you can easly craft your first few good decks after couple of weeks playing, without ripping of your whole wallet.I already loved playing Gwent with the Witcher 3 NPCs, even tho this version was very crappy. CD Project Red took this idea out of the game and made a whole new standalone version. I played it since release in March 2017, and since then they made a ton of changes and reworked the whole game multiple times. I never expirienced a developer who put so much love and work into a online card game after release and I am a bit sad that this Game is so unbelievable underrated. This is the only game i feel like I could play it until the last day of my life. I hope it's community keeps growing and the devs keep it alive <3//I already got 448 hours ingame time on GOG Galaxy, I just recently started playing it on steam;1;174,8;15/01/2022;203;5;;10.0

42;RPG;00,00;"Whew, here we go, I will subdivide in topics because it will be a long ride: I have +2200 hours of Gwent on GOG and over 300 confirmed kills (?).I play Gwent since the open beta and I consider myself a ""semi professional"" player (I play tournaments and Pro Rank since forever and doing top 500 lately, maybe 200 if I push hard)Important disclaimer to start:This game is not the Gwent of Witcher 3, its massively more deep and complex, and better of course. Only thing they have in common is you play for points and best of 3 rounds.Skill, Consistency and Less RNG:Gwent is objectively the card game in which the RNG matters less, and arguably, skill matters most. It is all about CONSISTENCY.Why is this? Not only because cards themselves have effects that are not random in their majority, but because of how deck sizes and draws work:- Your deck has 25 Cards- You draw 10 at the beginning of the game, with 2 or 3 mulligans.- On round 2, you draw 3 more, and have 2 more mulligans- On Round 3, you draw 3 more, and have 2 more mulligans.So, I won't do all the math but as you can see, you have a very high chance of getting the cards you want or at least the ones you need to execute your gameplay. This is a HUGE difference from other card games in which your deck is huge and you are drawing 1 by 1 hoping to get what you want (thus, rng of the draw affecting a lot more because of this)The other thing about the skill intensiveness Gwent has, is that there is no mana, so you can play ANY card at ANY given turn. This opens you to A LOT of possibilities, which makes the game harder to master IMO and a lot more harder to analyze and play correctly or optimally.This is amazing if you are looking to smash your brain into the game and feel excited about playing WELL and winning by 1 point (that happens A LOT), BUT, can be a bit overwhelming also, making it a game that doesn't shine THAT much on casual play and that can get you brain-tired easier than other games in which you are just stomping the mana curve at the beginning.SettingThe art and the universe, well, it's the Witcher, if you like dark stuff you will love it, if you want some funny and light hearted stuff, you won't like it. I find it very appealing personally, but sometimes its too dark and can drag you down a little bit. Anyway it's awesome for the most part, and also very mature.Generosity (NO P2W)Gwent is the most generous digital card game ever. Period. You can analyze the numbers and you will see it.Even LoR being generous, Gwent just goes over the top with it. You will have a Tier 1 deck in no time playing this game without paying, I can guarantee it.DevelopmentWell this is the roughest spot of Gwent. While CDPR is a great company that made great games, for Gwent it is lacking a bit. I mean, they hear the community for sure and deliver some balances here and there to fix things, but the patches are always messy (with bugs), some balance decisions are very questionable (but they later fix them), but for the most part, aside of some specific things, the game is always enjoyable and well balanced.Gwent as an EsportCompetitively speaking as an Esport, the circuit is nice, but can be improved. There are qualifiers every month in which the top 64 of the pro ladder compete for places on Gwent Open, an event in Poland that they pay your travel to and can win some nice money. Obviously reaching there is VERY HARD but it can be made, and grind is not the only thing that matters. Aside from this official circuit, there are plenty of tournaments organized by the community, in which sadly I would like CDPR to get involved more (so we can have money prizes) but that still doesn't happen. Anyway they are fun, the people is great, there are streaming coverage, and nice ingame prizes.CommunityCommunity is nice, aside from the same trolls as all games has on reddit and such, for tournaments all the big teams are very nice and open, there are many videos with information and stuff to help new players, and many of tournaments iniatives made by the community (on english and even on spanish too)ConclusionFor real, on Gwent, SKILL matters, and don't take it from the AD, take it from me that I've been playing now for 3 years competitively.Invite link to get thingieshttps://www.playgwent.com/invite-a-friend/VN7IQY9ABA";1;439,1;19/05/2020;232;11;;0.0

43;Adventure; 55,99;I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.Real decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.But instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.Some really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.Also some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.You also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). But piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.If there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.Some people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.The real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.So if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.It does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.However, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.Not sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.Maybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.Is it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.People complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.;1;47,8;13/11/2018;351;5;;8.0

43;Adventure; 55,99;I thoroughly enjoyed Thronebreaker, and give it a full 10/10. It's really quite brilliant.The writing is superb, and the voice acting really brings the story to life.As for Gwent, well, it's much improved over the original Witcher 3 version, and the battles in Thronebreaker are tailored to fit the story, with special cards and rules. I rarely got bored in the 55 hours it took me to finish.Make no mistake, this is another epic tale from the Witcher universe, and I highly recommend it.......but a couple of things worth knowing before you buy:1. Witchers feature very little in Thronebreaker. This is more a story of rulers and their armies.2. If you buy Thronebreaker on Steam, you can't unlock the perks in Gwent on GOG. You'll need to buy the GOG version to do that. (Edit: Gwent is now available on Steam);1;59,0;19/05/2019;94;4;;10.0

43;Adventure; 55,99;I went into this game completely blind, knowing nothing about it. At the time of writing this I have 10 hours of play time. 8 of those were from the day i got this game in one long session.  I will update this as I go further through the game, even though no one cares and no one will read this.I don't know how long this is going to be but just in case TLDR: The game is good. But not perfect. The story is fantastic, giving you the details of what happens outside of the stuff you play in the main Witcher games. The actions you choose throughout the game effect the gameplay and story. The effects of your decisions become apparent at a good enough pace to keep you interested. Even some of the most mundane decisions that you think wont have any effect, will change the game. The voicing is done very well and feels real and with emotion.The gameplay is split into two parts, traversing the map and the gwent. The map traversing is fun, the art style is beautiful and suits the game very well. When traveling the map you loot and fight random encounters. There are treasures to find and points of interest that can affect your gameplay and story. My one gripe with this part of the game is the slow movement speed, which is expensive to upgrade.Gwent is main part of this game. Don't like gwent, sucks to suck this game isn't for you. The gwent in this game is a dumbed down version of the Gwent in the Witcher 3 and the standalone Gwent game. You only have two rows of cards to play. Other than that the mechanics are similar if not the same. At the start of the game your freedom of deck style is limited but as you advance it expands. Your actions in the story will have an effect on your cards. Cards can be taken away or added depending on your decisions and how the game goes. The camp system is where you can buy upgrades, train new cards, configure your deck, do practice matches and talk to the people in your party.  Every system here works well and adds to the game. Conclusion: This game is really good. For me it has very few flaws, an intriguing fluid plot, and fun casual gameplay. This game requires patience if you want the best experience, and can be frustrating at times when you cant get past a battle or a puzzle. If you are a fan of the Witcher series, especially the story, this game is for you.Why the hell did I write this. No one will read this everyone knows the game is good. Oh well someone hire me as a reviewer despite my garbage writing skills.Update 1: 43 HoursSome of the battles and puzzles are disproportionately hard. I have been playing on the hardest difficulty throughout my playthrough. Due to my actions I've lost a lot of good characters. Taking the middle path between good and evil can sometimes be worse than being evil. Multiple times I have gotten furious at this game. I am writing this after a battle that took be almost 2 hours to beat. Upgrading your camp is way more important than I thought, and I hate myself for being so charitable throughout the game.Update 2: End of The GameI got one of the good endings. It was pretty cool. But I have another complaint about the game. WHERE THE HELL WAS GERALT. Yes I understand this game is about Meve and the Nilfguardian war. But it is still a Witcher game, and especially when Geralt is shown on the cover art of the game how are you gonna have him pop up for just one scene. It was cool to get some backstory about him, but I am a bit sad. I freaked out when he appeared, and cried when he disappeared. Awful game -120/10. Not enough Geralt. I would not play this game again in the near future. At some point it got a bit tedious.;1;45,3;22/05/2020;60;12;;8.0
43;Adventure; 55,99;CDPR did it again, they proved that it's not the budget that defines a good game, and that Geralt is not the reason why the Witcher universe is so successful and enjoyable to dive in. Thronebreaker is standalone single-player card game in the Witcher universe, where there are no good choices, only different shades of grey. It's definitely not as huge production as the Witcher 3, but for its price I can definitely say that CDPR didn't disappoint, it's probably the best single player card game I've ever played, with strong story, good design, a lot of puzzles to solve and synergy strategies to put in use. Nothing here feels forced, rushed or neglected, the game is very enjoyable at its core and I can recommend it for everybody who liked the gwent mini-game from Witcher 3, let alone fans of card games, since for them this is a mandatory position.I'm not a huge fan of card-based games myself, but I did enjoy the one in Witcher 3, and I enjoyed this one even more. Thronebreaker is a very solid position with a rich story, something that I didn't know was possible considering its card game genre, but CDPR once again proved that they don't accept anything else but a masterpiece in its perfection. I admire them for the work put into even the smallest details, something a lot of other game studios could learn from, as playing games like these is a pure pleasure for my mind.Good job CDPR!;1;95,6;25/12/2018;82;2;;10.0

44;Adventure; 29,99;"This is a good realization of the board game. It is playable as hot-seat or online and may give you many hours of enjoyable experience.But there are some flaws that need to be fixed to make the game perfect:1. When a player have to do a choice, he/she can't access to the game map and/or any player hero sheet and resources including his/her own. This may easily lead to wrong decisions and waste fun. The board game is obviously free from this limitation. So, the possibility to ""minimize"" the choice and take look at the game state will make the game much comfortable.2. Some choices are not clearly described. For example, Triss Merigold has a spell to look at the two top investigation cards then put one on the bottom of the deck and the other back on top. When this spell is used, the game show two cards and say to the player just ""choose one of them"". What will be happen next with the chosen card is unclear.3. The rules of the game says that proofs can't be exchanged back to leads. So, the investigation successes of a hero converted to proofs must me ""protected"" from any bad events that force the hero to spend leads. But in the computer version proofs ARE exchanged back to leads every time a hero must spend more leads than he/she have.4. The AI is wery weak, so the single-player games are dull and not enjoyable at all.5. There is no russian language, sadly to many and many russian-speaking Witcher fans.6. In network games, when a player quits at the characters selecting stage, all other players are forced to quit and try to start network game again. That allows one player to abuse many other.7. Triss ""Teleport"" spell is mightly overpowered. It allows Triss to collect two leads in a turn without any risk. I think, this is not the board game disbalance but the wrong implementation in computer game. Some other abilities with the text ""when you perform [stated action] {do something in addition}"" also work weird in the computer game.";1;1364,2;1/12/2014;199;4;;2.0

44;Adventure; 29,99;This recommendation is conditional.  If you were interested in getting the physical board game, as I was, I would definitely recommend this as it could save you $60 if you decide that it's not for you.  Another condition is to have friends you could play this with if you don't plan on getting the physical game.  If you do not meet either of these conditions, then this game gets a little hard to recommend at the moment.  The AI is fairly stupid which, for the first game or 2, is fine.  But after 1 game for me, I was able to face-roll the AI.  I think I won by almost 45 victory points.  It's always possible that the devs could improve the AI.  But as of right now, that's where other people would come in to play.

44;Adventure; 29,99;A game reminiscent of Mario Party with board game mechanics.A board game themed witcher game, which features characters from the witcher series in the game. Basically, it plays like a board game on the pc. If you ever played any of the Mario Party games, this game is similiar. Each player takes good or bad card hits on their turn and can move spaces or do certain actions on each turn. Note that it seems that negative cards usually are more in the game then positive cards, but that what makes it interesting, what you do with the negative effects and play a round with them. Anyways, here is my pro/con list as usual:PROs:`Featuring characters in the Witcher series`Board game mechanics`Interesting playing cards randomized to give good or bad fates`Quests that you need to do`Online Multiplayer`Local Co-op up to 4 playersCONs:`Repitition. Every turn, you do something, kill a monster (or fail), and then end turn. Every turn is similiar.`Getting killed by same monster every turn can happen to you, thus making you fail the gameMY final thoughts: If your a fan of the witcher series, i recommend it. Also, there is multiplayer online play. Other than that, this game can become repitive if you play it too much. Be careful of that.;1;2,4;5/05/2017;54;5;;8.0
44;Adventure; 29,99;"ITALIANOGioco a Witcher Adventure Game sin dalla beta, quando ancora era molto povero di contenuti, e mi divertiva molto sin da allora.Inizio spiegando brevemente (per coloro che non capissero bene l'inglese) cos'è il gioco. Witcher Adventure Game è un gioco da tavolo tratto dalla saga di The Witcher(c): esiste sia in versione cartacea che in versione digitale (esattamente questa). E' possibile giocarci contro il computer (selezionando quali pedine muovere o lasciare all'IA o togliere del tutto) o online contro giocatori umani, in lobby pubblica o in stanza privata.Si può giocare come Geralt, Triss, Yarpen e Dandelion, ognuno dei quali ha abilità, vantaggi e svantaggi diversi. Il gioco ruota intorno alle carte missione e i punti vittoria. All'inizio di ogni partita è possibile determinare quante di queste sarà necessario completare per vincere (1, 3 o 5), nonchè un tempo limite per ogni turno (che inizierà a decorrere se rimaniamo inattivi).Ogni carta missione ha 1 obiettivo principale (che una volta completato elimina la carta), 2 obiettivi secondari (che se completati danno extra PV) e un obiettivo di supporto che può completare un altro giocatore e ricompensa entrambi di PV. Si completano gli obiettivi accumulando ""leads"" e ""proofs"", dei simboli colorati ottenuti spostandoci di luogo nel tabellone o con le carte di investigazione (che vanno risolte appena utilizzate). L'esito di molte azioni e degli scontri è determinato dai dadi e dalle abilità del personaggio. Il gioco finisce quando uno dei giocatori completa l'ultima carta missione (non è necessario completare per forza gli obiettivi secondari) e vince il giocatore con il maggior numero di punti vittoria.I punti vittoria si possono acquisire in battaglia, con carte speciali, si possono altresì perdere nello stesso modo.La fortuna gioca un ruolo molto importante nel gioco, in quanto esistono carte malevole (che possono bloccare alcune abilità e rallentare il tuo gioco o quello di tutti), oltre a quelle benevole, ed è importante imparare a pianificare le mosse e utilizzare le abilità del personaggio per ottimizzare i propri turni e vincere.I difetti che ho riscontrato finora sono i seguenti:- Trovo che Yarpen sia un po' più lento e penalizzato rispetto agli altri personaggi, ma magari son solo io...- Una cosa che invece andrebbe indubbiamente migliorata è l'intelligenza artificiale nella modalità offline, il computer sembra prendere decisioni totalmente casuali e abusa il fast-travel quasi volesse bombardarsi (e bombardare il giocatore) di carte malevole come unica difficoltà.- Purtroppo il multiplayer è ancora poco popolato, spesso si finisce per giocare dei semplici duo, e a volte si trova la lobby vuota e si deve aspettare, ma se si riesce o si ha la fortuna di formare un match da 4 è davvero piacevole.- Per il tipo di gioco non è ancora possibile rientrare in partita in seguito a un crash..Il mio giudizio finale:Il gioco ha una curva di apprendimento adatta a tutti e se amate i giochi da tavolo questo vi piacerà sicuramente.Personalmente lo trovo rilassante e apassionante, da sempre quella sensazione di sfida e di sorpresa (che carte usciranno? a volte si può passare da una situazione di vantaggio allo svantaggio o viceversa in pochissimi turni), ogni partita è diversa pur con le stesse meccaniche e una tira l'altra come le ciliege.Di sicuro lo consiglio vivamente a tutti i fan della saga, ma è una ottima alternativa anche per tutti i casual gamers in cerca di un passatempo e una sfida diversa dal solito.ENGLISHI've been playing this game ever since its Beta and even it hadn't half of the current features I enjoyed it very much.You play by completing objectives with the given abilities (different for every protagonist) and rolling the dice, and win by having the highest number of Victory Points.The game's learning curve is not hard, but you need to know your character's abilities and to optimize your turn in order to win. However luck plays a big role during your matches, as not all cards give benefits, and the game is rich of dangers and obstacles.In the whole it feels like every match is different and unpredictable, giving this game an infinite replayability.You will probably want to play the game for its multiplayer feature, but it also has a singleplayer mode which can be enjoyed to play against oneself. However I found AI a bit casual and stupid (it feels like computers move are totally random and don't fit the mission objectives), which devs may want to correct. On the other hand, multiplayer still need to be properly populated, you may have to wait to form a match, but if you're able to gather 4 players it is lot of fun.This game loses a bit if your network crashes frequently or if your computer enters in conflict with it, as there's no way to re-join previously quitted games yet.Finally, they could probably do something to improve a little bit Yarpen, which I feel being slightly disadvantaged compared to the other heroes.If you like board games and/or you're a fan of the Witcher saga this game could probably be a must for you, and you would enjoy it in any case. If you're a casual gamer or are looking for something different to spend your time over, a new way of challenging people, or a relax moment, this game fits your wishes.(I'm not an experienced reviewer, I hope to be of help, leave below any question or comment)";1;35,5;16/01/2015;49;0;;10.0
44;Adventure; 29,99;The Witcher Adventure Game is a surprisingly well made digital board game adaptation, which massively shines during multiplayer due to its depth and an absolutely stunning amount of content as well as immaculate love for detail.The target audience is a small niche though, as is is made for diehard Witcher fans and boardgame enthusiasts alike. For most people of the general public not belonging to both of these groups it might start to feel a bit convoluted as time passes, yet the game itself remains one of the best digital boardgames I personally have played in the last couple of years.Do recommend. Just be aware that you need to be both a Witcher fan and boardgame enthusiast to be able to fully appreciate this title.;1;171,5;24/04/2018;38;0;;8.0
44;Adventure; 29,99;I would have liked to give this game a good review but I cannot. The singleplayer AI is absolutely horrible so offline mode isn't any fun after you learn the game. Online is horribly unbalanced due to Triss being able to teleport around acquiring 2 leads per turn compared to the other characters 1, thus completing the quests 2x as fast as the other characters. Every 3 game match I get into with a halfway decent triss player completes the third quest in 14-20 turns while everyone else is finsihing their first or getting onto their second. This would be an easy fix to simply allow the teleport card to be used before travel only or limit only 1 lead from travelling per turn.Its also quite annoying how you can't directly hinder an opponent, You might draw a card randomly by chance to slightly hinder them but it's nothing significant and will likely hurt you just as much. Other than the balance and horrible AI it is a pretty fun game though;0;23,7;9/05/2015;90;6;;2.0

It’s really annoying that you have to switch from Warzone to MWII every time you want to play MWII. You literally have to enter the game twiceMWII Campaign The campaign is like an awesome movie for a few evenings. It's definitely worth buying, but I'd suggest waiting for a sale MWII Multiplyer It’s like every other Call of Duty multiplayer experience.

46;Action; 184,00;The PC version of Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy offers all the content and patches found in the other versions of the game. On top of this, you get the ability to play at unlocked framerates, 4k resolution, native support for all major controllers (Xbox One / 360 / Dualshock 4 / Steam Controller) along with a move set for keyboard and mouse. If you’ve played the PS4 version, the multiplatform release brings a slew of fixes and one piece of additional content. A new level “Future Tense” which incorporates elements from an unfinished level found in the original Crash Bandicoot from 96’ – dubbed the “waterfall level”. Among the fixes are: Added the option to skip the intro that was unskippable on the PS4 version back when it launched. Added a new voice line for defeating a specific boss. Added a weirdly missing box in one of the levels.and most importantly, improved load times. Whether you install the game on a hard drive or an SSD the load times in the multiplatform release are between 5-7 seconds for each map, compared to the long 30ish seconds in the original release.I only have two complaints that I’ve found so far with the PC port:When you finish time trials you are greeted with a screen that lets you input three letters representing your name on a worldwide scoreboard. This input screen was implemented horribly. You must scroll through each letter fra A-Z with the keyboard. Instead of being able to type it…. with the keyboard. And it doesn’t remember the letters you’ve written, so you must do it each time you manage to beat your own time record.They’ve still managed to not add a restart button to the game map, so if you try to get a gem that requires zero lost lives, you don’t get the choice to restart the map, if you were to die. To restart the level you must exit the level, return to the hub world, choose the level again. Instead of using the restart functionality, that is already available in time trials. Now this is not as bad as it was in the original release, as I’ve said, the loading times are far better now, it’s still just weird they didn’t decide to add this, when the functionality already exists in the game for another game mode.In spite of this, I whole heartedly recommend the N.Sane Trilogy on the PC, as it is the definitive version of the game, and it’s shortcomings are few and far between.;1;84,2;2/07/2018;253;4;;10.0

47;Action; 274,00;When I first got the game, I liked it.  Then I met the first mini-boss and died a lot.  I got better.  Watched quite a few walk-throughs and tips videos.  I hated everything about it.  The I-frames, the enemy fight timings, the death mechanics, the Ogre...oh! that damnable, stinking ogre!  I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly.  Then about 20 hours in, I just got it.  I understood.  Then I was able to appreciate the landscapes, the quests, and the story line. I got my platinum in about 43 hours.  I've played through about 38 times, conquered all DLC gauntlets, and still love playing it.  I can now do a full run through in about 10 hours if I play all the side quests and kill all there is to kill.  Still hate the Headless though.  1007 hours and still love it.  I probably can't play anything else that From Software has now, but that is okay.  I'll still give the Souls series a try at some point.

47;Action; 274,00;I was bored, and saw that this game won game of the year, so I bought it.After playing this game for two and a half hours, dying repeatedly to the game's first mini-boss, I contacted steam and demanded a refund for a game I simply couldn't play....but I couldn't get it out of my head.I got the game again for Christmas, and after finally killing that first mini-boss, I couldn't get over how I felt. I kept going, perfecting the fighting style until I reached the game's first real boss. It knocked me down again. I fought that boss over and over again until the swordplay became a lethal kind of dance. I felt invincible. After the first boss, I went onto the next one, and the next, until I completed the game's first ending. Then I played it all again, exploring the abilities, fighting styles, and story arcs that I hadn't tried before. I reached the game's truly final boss and killed it in one try because the game had trained me to fight so well. It was by far the most rewarding experience any video game has ever given me. After over 150 hours, I earned every single achievement.From someone who refunded this game the first day they played it, from someone who would have never been remotely interested in Japanese culture otherwise, let me tell you that Sekiro is one of a kind. Not only is the combat an art-form in and of itself, but the story is moving and the characters compelling.If you buy Sekiro, don't get frustrated when you hit a wall. Don't look up cheese strategies or try to savescum the game. Get back up, watch a walkthrough or two if you really need to, and vault over that wall like a f***ing shinobi. You won't regret it.;1;184,0;13/05/2021;576;21;;10.0

49;Action; 184,00;One of my fondest memories of Spyro was eating a chocolate orange while playing Ripto's Rage during summer. You know, the kind you have to smash on the table to break them into slices? My mom brought it for me and it was pretty damn good.Twenty years later, I'm 31 and mom's not here anymore. But Spyro is. And the updated graphics still look how I remember, because our kid imaginations would fill in all the gaps to create a beautiful landscape. And it's pretty damn good.

49;Action; 184,00;"One day many years ago. Me and my friend decided we were going to boot up Spyro 1 and play through the entire game in a single night. We went to the living room, had a bowl of candy and some pizza, and we started playing. Every time one of us died or finished a level we would switch off, we were laughing and talking about how much fun it was back in the day and how well it held up to that point in time. After several hours it was past the midnight hour. My friend started to get droopy eyes and just wanted to watch me play. I zoomed through some levels and got some secrets. Then I peeked over to where he lay on the couch. There he was, passed out, exhausted from the long night we had spent enjoying each other's company. I found a blanket from his room and laid it over him, before turning the tv and playstation 1 off. Then I quietly without a sound left his house and drove home. While driving home I sat in silence, grinning at the thought of what he would say the next day. ""When did you leave?"" ""When did I pass out?"". But I couldn't help but feel extremely grateful to have been able to spend time with a fantastic friend playing a wonderful game from our childhoods. This is obviously the beautiful remaster of the first 3 Spyro games. But I can't help but love the old time graphics and simple charm of the first original game. And I'm sure that memory plays a big part into why that is. Please play this game. Make your own memories. Smile just a little more than you normally do. Enjoy your life";1;1,4;23/01/2024;135;3;;10.0
49;Action; 184,00;I played the old games on the PlayStation 1 when I was but a small tyke, so the Spyro games hold a special place in my heart.This remaster did not disappoint me. The games are still as fun as they ever were, whether you have ever played a Spyro game before or not.I'll add more stuff to the list when I think of it. For now, here's the stuff:Here's the good stuff:+ The game is fun!+ There are a lot of levels, secrets, and collectibles which are fun to find (most of the time).+ There are many, many hours worth of gameplay and levels. I would say this game lasted me much longer than, say, Mario Odyssey.+ Controller support works fine, of course. Personally, I really can't imagine playing Spyro with anything other than a controller.+ Spyro moves in a responsive and satisfying way, pretty much the same as he always did.+ The models are very well done for the most part, Spyro himself being the best example.+ The graphics and lighting are great, and done in a stylized way that pleases the eyes.+ Spyro moves like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disney animation, and his voice acting is wonderful.+ The other animations in the game are also very good.Here's the bad stuff:- Some of the character models are a little uncanny, but that might just be me.- In some cases the camera is a little too close to Spyro, which can make some people (like me) occasionally nauseous or queasy.- The game is not that well optimised. The frame rate can tank if there are specific effects or entities on the screen (e.g. Spyro breathing fire while on a spinning blade in Hurricos)The game is, overall, amazing. My nostalgia goggles prevent me from liking it as much as the original PS1 games - that being said, I loved the old games and I love this game.A lot of time and effort clearly went into making this a high quality remaster of the original 3 games, and it is well worth the price.I highly recommend this game.;1;35,6;7/09/2019;148;7;;10.0
