My wife and I are about 4 hours in and this game has already totally blown us away. I honestly can't remember the last time a game made me smile and laugh this much while also being totally engrossed in the gameplay. The split screen takes a little getting used to at first and then you don't even notice it.Just an absolute joy to play and hands-down the best couch coop game I have played in about two and a half decades of PC gaming (yikes I'm getting old...).Buy it,28 March
