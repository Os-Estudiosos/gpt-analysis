Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.I should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  So right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  None of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.What kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  I’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.The team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.I’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  I wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.Okay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.The hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  Also I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  I won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  If you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.;Recommended;418.7;24/01/2019;2,483;115
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise. Graphics Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.  Story The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy. The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me. Gameplay If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything. You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities. Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with. As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.  Grind? I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue. Final Recommendation I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss. Pros-Stunning Game World-Interesting Story-Well thought-out RPG mechanics -Tons of things to do-Exhilarating CombatCons-Lame mid-late game pacing-Poor rendering-Executions aren't greatFinal Rating - 8.6/10If you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity. an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the "decisions" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another. chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!;Recommended;234.8;5/10/2018;1,524;32
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey  ⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:              - Main Story - 43½ Hours              - Main + Extras - 83 Hours               - Completionist - 137 Hours By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review. ⚔ Gameplay: 🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)🔲 Definitely🔲 Infinitely replayableThe game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game. 😄 Fun: 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy☑️ Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember🔲 Ride of your lifeAs a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did. 🏞 Graphics: 🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game🔲 Good (nothing special)☑️ Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceThe graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work. 🔊 Sound: 🔲 Makes your ears bleed🔲 Bad☑️ Not special🔲 Good🔲 Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceI felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven. 📖 Story: 🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story🔲 It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written☑️ Epic story🔲 MasterpieceWithout spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter. 🧵 Length: 🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee🔲 Short🔲 Average☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)🔲 To infinity and beyondAccording to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.I wish it would be shorter. 💷 Price: 🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price☑️ Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of moneyDepending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore. 🧩 Difficulty: 🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it🔲 Easy☑️ Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too. ⚖ Pros & Cons:  ➕ Pros: + The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all. ➖ Cons: - It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.- Too long. I really wish it would be shorter.- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult. only a few of them get that treatment. ⚙ Bugs: 🔲 Never heard of☑️ Minor bugs🔲 Can get annoying🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsI've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU. ⭕Conclusion: AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.Originally posted by TalePlay: If you've read this far, I want to say thank you and do check our Curator Page called TalePlay.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 179,99;I bought the Gold Edition, which seems to have a better value. Here's some info on the different editions:Standard Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game) DELUXE DIGITAL PACK: - Kronos pack - contains the full Armour of Kronos armour set, the Hourglass mount, and the spear "Harvester of Time" - this pack gives more warrior damage boost- Herald of Dusk pack - contains the full Herald of Dusk set of armour, and the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focused.- Capricornus Naval Pack - contains the Capricornus boat and sailor skins - purely cosmetic.- Temporary boosts to XP and money - boost lasts for 2 hours.Gold Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)SEASON PASS: LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE, THE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece + The Games: Assassin's Creed III REMASTERED and Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTERED. Ultimate Edition (Digital) Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition - Check the Content Info AboveSEASON PASS - Check the Content Info AboveSo, the only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content. Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on. up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on sale, though I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition.Note:  You can not upgrade to Deluxe Edition later on, meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition, and that's money wasted. Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later on, is not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise. You are saving money and getting the best of the game. For Season Pass owners (which is in the Gold and Ultimate Editions) - Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered will not appear in your library as it is a part of, and available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered. So, in order to play Liberation Remastered, you need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered. Both Remasters are slightly better graphically, than their previous versions. You have to launch Assassin's Creed Odyssey once, before trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition. Otherwise, the Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activation, which is not possible anymore.  For any problems with the Ubisoft client: Verify Integrity of Game Files on Steam and if it doesn't work then uninstall the Ubisoft client and delete the current version and redownload the client from the Ubisoft site. If you still have problems then God help you dealing with Ubisoft/Steam support. The latter has a faster response but both suffer from the same level of retardation.Hopefully, the info will help you, so you don't have to look around various sites or contact the terrible support teams.Ps: If you are interested, feel free to check my Assassin's Creed Black Flag Review - https://steamcommunity.com/id/brake_id/recommended/242050/;Recommended;5.6;19/03/2021;256;3

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;(DRM notice: this game requires a Uplay account, requires you to connect to Uplay when starting up, and it also uses Denuvo DRM. DRM is inherently bad for the customer so I wanted to warn you about that.)Far Cry 5 is a decent entry into the series, and often underrated in comparison to previous titles.Honestly, if you played Far Cry 2, 3 or 4 - you know what to expect. Same game, different setting. The main reason people rate it lower than 3 and 4 is because by this point, they've grown tired of the same old formula (and because of the weird ending, but I'm not gonna spoil that... you have to see it for yourself). Far Cry 5 is just as good as its predecessors. That said, let's give this a proper analysis, shall we?You shoot bad guys. This time it's in rural America.It's a Far Cry game. What did you expect? It follows the Ubisoft open world formula of a big world occupied by enemy forces, which you slowly liberate by wiping out enemy outposts like you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rambo. There's a basic but functional stealth system of silent melee takedowns, silent weapons like bows, throwing knives, and silenced guns, and enemies raising the alarm if they see you or find a dead body. You can conquer outposts either by going in slow and methodical, or you can just storm in guns blazing and mow everyone down with an MG. The combat is fun. Controls are pretty smooth, most weapons are satisfying to use, and neither you nor the enemy are bullet sponges. Sometimes you will have to deal with enemy helicopters, or you can fly one yourself to rain death from above. Fun!The only criticism I have compared to earlier Far Cry titles (especially Far Cry 1 and 2) is how the physics engine has been dialed down a bit. Many items are static objects that don't ever move (I kicked a bunch of cans and they just stayed in place... lame), and most cover can't be pierced by bullets, unlike earlier games where thin wooden walls could easily be penetrated by high caliber weaponry. At least the fire spreading mechanics are still there, making the flamethrower a potentially devastating weapon... with which you can easily grill yourself if you're not careful.The game is set in Hope County, a fictional area in the US state of Montana, where a crazy cult is taking over and forcibly recruiting the population. You arrive as a policeman (or policewoman, this is the first Far Cry game with character customization and you get to pick your gender) coming to arrest the leader of that cult, but of course the cultists fight back and you have to run. During the course of the game, you meet with various resistance members and help them fight the cult until they are wiped off the map. The setting is quite enjoyable, especially if you like rural America. As a European, I find American culture quite fascinating, and this game is full of it. All the resistance people are proud American patriots, and you get to see a lot of those weird roadside attractions they have in the rural US, like a park with giant plastic mammoth statues and farms that advertise their tomatoes with giant tomato signs. Very quaint.I got captured... AGAINAs far as the story structure is concerned, the antagonists are pretty interesting and the story overall is competently told. But the way they force you into the main quest missions... yeah, that's definitely questionable. Whenever you earn enough "Resistance Points" in a region (by doing side quests or liberating outposts), the bad guys will send a capture party to abduct you. They don't just do it once per region, but several times. When I finished the game, I had been captured at least six times... and if we count the scenes where Faith puts you into a drug-induced trance so she can try and convert you to the cult, that increases to nine times.Nine. Times.And each time, you - of course - manage to escape and kill a whole bunch of cultists in the process. They should have realized that keeping you alive is a bad idea after the second time, but nope. They just keep abducting you and try to convert you to their cause, until you finally kill all the leaders. Of all the methods they could have used to drive the story forward, this is by far the dumbest. It almost feels like the bad guys are deliberately giving you a chance over and over again.The cult leaders are appropriately vile and violent characters, and the acting and animation is really good. I usually hate cutscenes, but I found the ones in Far Cry 5 to be quite engaging, because the characters are so interesting. I have to rate the main story as "good", but... the way they keep using that abduction mechanic to drive the plot forward... that's just stupid. So utterly stupid. And the worst part is that it can hit you anywhere once you triggered it. Doing a sidequest right now? Haha sorry, abduction squad is here. Flying around in a helicopter? Yeah there's a sedative arrow in your leg now, don't ask where it came from. It's just dumb.You've seen it before. It's nothing new, but it's good.Really, apart from the dumb way they handled the main story progression with those stupid abduction scenes, Far Cry 5 doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's another competently made Far Cry game. More of the same for people who enjoy this style of game. Open world driving around, shooting bad guys, doing side quests. It even has the same mission types as the previous Far Crys: rescue a friend and man the gun while he drives the truck to your home base, go to a location and kill the enemies, find collectibles and bring them to an NPC, etc etc. The standard fare as usual. Did you play Far Cry 3 or 4? This is like that, except set in Montana instead of a tropical island or Tibet.If you like Far Cry games, you're gonna like this. If you don't, you won't.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;In a nutshell:Pros:1. Good graphics2. Surprises in the story at the end3. Game physics is good4. More involvement of Bosses in game (unlike Far Cry 4), which is good.5. Adds lot more contents in the game when compared to its predecessors.6. Availability of Guns for hire. OR form Your own squad with AI characters, which gets unlocked as the story progress.7. No more tower capture to unlock a region (although some elements of it exists here too)8. More detailed and realistic gun/vehicular battles.9. Support for Co-op in Story mode.10. Arcade mode for some extra game play.Cons:1. Even on pretty good configuration PC(GTX 1070 8GB), FPS drops to 30 sometimes, but not many instances. Probably because the game is tailored for AMD graphics.2. No option to change difficulty in middle of game story. Need to play out entire story in same difficulty level.3. Too much content in Game User Interface (UI) /Map which causes the UI to be cluttered.4. If You are someone who is moving up the far cry timeline and played FC3 and FC4 before this, You might take at least an hour of game play to understand the game features.5. In gun battles, hit reg not accurate sometimes.6. Co-op in story mode restricted to only 2 players in total (i.e. Yourself and one friend).7. If You invite Your friend to play in Co-op, only Your story proceeds/missions complete, and your friend's does not. Above Pros and Cons should be sufficient if You do not have time to read through the detailed review and need to decide if You want to buy this game or not. More detailed review below.P.S: Please play this game before playing Far Cry: New Dawn, to enjoy the new dawn instalment better.In Detailed Review:The Game:Unlike prior Far cry instalments, this game environment has more modern vibes to it. So, You'll have more modern weapons, and visiting a place on the map reveals it. No more tower climbing to remove cloaking.Basically, the map is a group of islands, ruled over by one main Boss (The Father) and 3 under bosses (His 2 brothers and 1 sister, well not biological though, haha). They together form a cult and make life hell for the natives. Its either join the cult or face Your maker, simple right?So, You play the role of a rookie deputy who will fight Your way to liberate the islands, and there is lots of story and elements to it on the way.The bosses:Each boss brings in their own flavour and elements to the story and game play, which is kind of good and makes missions less repetitive. The more outposts You liberate (not many, may be 4 to 5 outposts per boss) and more missions You complete (given by the natives), the more interest the local boss takes in You, taking you closer to defeat them.The Vehicles:A wide variety of Vehicles available, like trucks, vans, SUVs, boats etc along with the new addition of airplanes and helicopters, which can be used in free roam and missions.Guns for Hire:Basically 2 types:Type 1: CivilianEach civilian You rescue from the cults grasp during free roam can be used as a Gun for hire during next mission, until You release them. They ride with You, they can die for You, kill for You with guns blazing or with stealth. They can be found all over the map. No specialisations as such, good for regular gun fights.Type 2: Story AI CharactersThe other set of Guns for hire are the characters which are unlocked as You progress in main story. This set of Guns for hire are specialists and can be added to your squad. They can be called upon whenever You need them. There are 9 of these specialists which includes 3 animals and rest humans. The human specialists include a sniper, an airplane pilot, a helicopter pilot, a crossbow specialist (for stealth), a missile man etc. You can form a squad with them or call them in separately.Skills:Unlike prior instalments, skills in FC5 can be unlocked by finishing challenges. The challenges (which can be viewed in Map menu) needs to be completed to get reward points. These reward points can be used to unlock skills. Some challenges (for example) are get 10 kills with grenade, 8 kills with knife throw, 20 Melee kills, 5 road kills etc. So, higher the game difficulty, completing some challenges might get a bit difficult as game AI gets better.Skills are similar to FC3 and FC4, not many changes here. One difference I noticed is, no more crafting for weapon bag, loot bag, weapon holster etc by hunting animals for skins. This too needs reward points now. So make sure where You spend Your reward points well. Weapons:Anything and everything from a knife to arrow, pistol to assault and sniper rifles, from Grenade launchers to guided RPGs. If You have DLCs purchased too, You get martian weapons as well. You can carry upto 4 weapons at a time, provided You have unlocked the large weapon holster by using those reward points.Overall I would definitely recommend the game.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 7/10Attention to details: 6/10Thanks for reading the detailed review.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;I've been a fan of Far Cry since the 3rd game, and was pretty excited for this one. I was not disappointed for the most part. As a fan of the series I have a lot to say about this game, so be preprared for a long read.PROS+ Looks amazing and is well optimized+ Soundtrack is great, including the radio songs+ Joseph Seed, the antagnoist, while not as good as Vaas or Pagan Min, is still good and really feels intimidating.+ Enemies actually have motivation and purpose, as opposed to the mindless pirates in FC3 or the braindead soldiers in FC4+NPCs have stuff to say now, they can tell you about locations, bases, hidden stashes, etc. Some even have conversations with each other that are fun to listen to, huge improvment from the old NPCs who were basically just there to be eaten by animals. The main NPCs are great and memorable too.+Lots more wildlife than the previous games, even have challenges to hunt them+Fishing is cool I guess, it's actually engaging and not an AFK activity like fishing in most games+ Planes and Helicopters are now in the game, and you can buy and customize vehicles instead of having to find them+ The bosses besides Joseph are more fleshed out and have their own methods and personalities.+ Companions are a new addition and are great, they never feel like a burden and can be instructed. Peaches is my personal favorite+ New resistance system is cool, you complete lots of varied activities in the world until you have enough points to face the regional boss and liberate the region.NEUTRAL~ I'm personally not a fan of the setting, I live in the U.S. so Montana isn't all that intersting to me, I'd much rather travel somehwere far away and exotic, however they do pull it off well, the atmosphere is great and I can see why people love it~ Co-op is an absolute blast however friends can't progress with you, you have to do each person's game twice~ Arcade is meh and most of the maps are player made and suck. Wish you could choose to only play Ubisoft mapsCONS- Hunting only yields you money, gone are the days of crafting upgrades, which is a huge shame, the old system was much more engaging.- Weapon variety is pretty bad, most weapons are just reskins of the same gun, even the unique weapons are identical to the standard versions, and they don't require anything to unlock, just more money, which is strange because the standard weapons are locked until you get enough resistance points, you can get the unique AKM before the standard one, it makes no sense at all.- Perks feel underwhelming compared to previous games.- Enemy planes and helicopters spawn way too often, feels more like a chore to kill them rather than and exciting battle.-No bladed melee weapons, I miss cutting people up with my machete/khukuri :(-Microtransactions for skins. Why was this necessary? It doesn't even cost much to unlock things with in-game money.Overall I think the game is good and definitely lives up to the Far Cry franchise, there are issues that bug me but they didn't ruin my experience. I think you'll enjoy this game, it's worth the full 60$, something that can be seldom said about games in this industry nowdays.;Recommended;34.2;31/03/2018;847;28
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;The Patriot simulatorI'll start with the bottom line: All in all, its 'yet another far cry game', similar to how FC3, FC4 and to some extent FC Primal look and behave.* Story (with no spoilers) - You're playing as a deputy who tries to arrest a cult leader that has taken control of a county in Montana. This cult is made of religious extremists who believe the end is upon us and they must 'cull the herd' aka kill the weak to save the strong and be ready for 'the collapse' which is their modern version of the biblical flood i guess.Things go to sh*t when trying to arrest him and you and your group end up in a gang-war type of scenario which you must survive till you find shelter. From there, the game actually begins just like any other FarCry game begins - You're saved by an npc that instructs you on how to start managing yourself in the map's sorroundings.Been there, done that.* Map - Roughly on the same size as FC3/4/Primal in terms of total size, but is much more condensed and has a lot more things to do in it. The game overall feels more of a GTA V's free roam when it comes to side-events that you find while traversing it. You will find lots of friendlies and enemies driving around and packed action is basically everywhere.events like hostage rescue are very common, as well as helping out npc's on the road with their random problems.* Followers - The game has added npc follower mechanic which works pretty well. You can add upto 2 specific followers with you and they can level up as they kill enemies to gain buffs. Most of these npc's are scattered across the world map and each has their own buffs, so finding new npc's as followers is a game of roulette that will either reward or screw you in terms of how good the followers will be. You have a total of 9 special followers that are story-bound, and countless of scattered npc's that can be used as random followers, which you can only 'store' up to 3 on your followers list. You can command followers to move to certain spots, kill specific enemies, and even revive you if you're dying. Long press to make them follow you again. Each follower has its own command key so they can do different things if you order them different actions.* Guns - You can have upto 4 gun slots in your inventory (3 big weapons + 1 sidearm) + 1 slot for melee weapons + your own fists which you can use at anytime with your actual weapon (similar to Duke Nukem's kicks in the classic game Duke Nukem 3D). There are a few dozens of weapons in the game, ranging between melee weapons, pistols, smgs, rifles, snipers, and heavy guns like lmg's and rpg's.* Skill tree - Works a bit differently than previous FC games. Its a mashup of badass ranks from Borderlands 2 and previous FC titles. Instead of steady xp gain, you get skill points on certain actions that you do, like completing missions and finishing world objectives and achievements. You spend the skill points on perks just like previous FC titles. All the ammo/holster upgrades are managed through this skill tree, so theres no more benefit in hunting animals for these kind of upgrades. Animal hides can be sold for money but that's it.* AI - Enemy's AI seems to have a small improvement from earlier FC titles. They will take more time to detect you and their aim wont be as punishing as previous FC titles (tested on the hardest difficulty). Follower's AI can be wonky at times, but overall its tolerable.* Arcade mode - An added minigame that lets you play with and against other people in 6v6 matches or in co-op mode against AI enemies like zombies/aliens/humans. There is also a feature that lets you build your own levels and play other people's levels.* Uplay - The obvious elephant in the room - This game has some issues with Steam, even if you buy it directly from Steam, since it forces you to have Uplay installed and tells you to create a Uplay account for it anyway. From my experience, there are a few issues while playing this game that you should be aware of, though your milage may vary:1) When opening and then closing the steam overlay in mid game, there is a slight chance (of about 20%-30%) that the mouse will stop responding. This has been confirmed to only happen in this game so its not a mouse issue. If this happens to you, tab out of the game and tab back in to fix it.2) The more annoying issue: When pressing shift+f2 to bring up the Uplay interface (the equalevant of the Steam interface), there is a good chance the windows' mouse cursor will appear (and stay stuck) in the middle of the screen until you quit the game (will start happening after leaving uplay's interface and going back into the game). The only proper fix i've found for this is to restart the game. Sometimes, switching to 'borderless' mode instead of 'full screen' helps, but its not a guarantee.3) You cant rebind the tab button, which means that if pressing tab in mid game, it will always pause the game and switch to the map view. Sounds nice, but since you can't rebind it, you have to put up with constant game interruptions if you want to shift+tab to the Steam overlay while already in a game menu, as doing this will unpause your game in the process. In other words, you will have to be aware to not be in an in-game menu screen when tabbing into the steam overlay.Im fairly suspicious that these 3 issues are caused deliberatedly by Ubisoft to make Steam users avoid playing the game via the Steam interface and encourage them to migrate into Uplay entirely.* Performance - The game runs at an avg of 80 fps in high-ultra settings at 1440p with Radeon RX 5700XT GPU and Ryzen 5 2600x CPU. No big frame drops seemed to appear and its overall well optimized in my opinion.As for the DLC's...Lost on Mars - A 6-7 hours campaign that puts you on Mars with Hurk. This is a really nice DLC with incredible graphics and superb futuristic weapon designs. Lots of action packed and overall highly recommended.Hours of Darkness - A 3.5-4 hours campaign that puts you on a Vietnam rescue mission. This DLC is quite disappointing as the objectives are very generic with no real incentive to explore the map. Its also fairly easy with the weapons they give you from the beginning. No sense of progress and all in all it feels really rushed.Living Dead Zombies - A very short 1.5 hours gameplay that is split between 7 micro stories that Guy Marvel is trying to form about (yet another) zombie apocalypse. You play the role of the hero in each of these stories and basically he forms them while you traverse it from the world he's building around you, similar to Borderlands 2's DLC with Tiny Tina (but with zero character build up). The DLC shows how Guy Marvel is trying to pitch 7 ideas to different producers for them to build a movie from.This is the most disappointing DLC of the bunch as it offers by far the least amount of content and priced the same as the rest. Give it a hard pass.So, which FarCry 5 version should you buy?The basic one. Period. I've bought the Gold one as i thought the 3 DLC's will give me lots of extra hours to grind on each, but the reality was that only the Mars DLC was worth it, both in terms of length and gameplay/story. Some other things i've recieved were free cosmetics and a few extra weapons and cars that pretty much screamed 'pay to win', alongside some fancy cosmetics. Since in game money isn't a big issue in the game, i simply can't recommend buying the gold version for these extra gadgets as you can buy them later on from vendors anyway.So to sum it up: Buy the base game and the mars DLC individually, when they're on sale. Pass on the rest.In summary:As said in the beginning, when you boil it all up, its basically 'more FarCry', which comes with all the good and some of the bad of the previous titles. So if you loved playing the recent FarCry games, you will sure love this, but it doesn't seem to add anything that is new to the formula.;Recommended;80.2;2/05/2020;192;5

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;Far Cry 5As a person who played through Far Cry 1 to Far Cry New Dawn I can say that this series had it's own falls and rises. And Far Cry 5 stays somewhere in the middle. Anyway, let's get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Cool partner system.+ Decent story. It was interesting at the start, boring in the middle and cool at the end.+ Stashes with cash are mostly interesting to solve.+ Clutch Nixon's challenges are really cool to do especially with a friend.+ Planes and Helicopters are really fun and good addition to the game.Cons:- There are some funny additional missions but most of them are boring.- Most of the additional and even main characters feel poorly written and not interesting.- It's mostly a game with the same mechanics and I don't mind it in some way but why remove good mechanics? For example, you don't need to hunt animals anymore because they only give you money for their skins and not an upgraded holster, etc like in previous parts.- If you play co-op your friend will not complete the story on their character which is some straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because my friend literally couldn't level up skills because the requirement is to kill a boss who we killed but it counts only for the host and he couldn't even buy guns because in his story he didn't reach a resistance level for it. I give this game a 6/10.Far Cry New DawnAnd I want to give a quick review of this game here as I didn't play it on Steam.Pros:+ Cool aesthetic design for everything. Map, animals, bikers, guns. Guns are especially cool.+ Really cool animations on silent kills. Made me wanna say "oof" for that poor guy who I stabbed in the eye.+ Story is a sequel of course. Simple and good I would say. + Sorties are especially cool and even unique to the series. Capturing a valuable bag and getting out in many different places is what I really enjoyed. Cons:- Partners are even cooler and funnier here but sometimes I don't get how they are so weak to instantly die from a lvl 1 biker.- Kinda short for its price.I give it a 7.5/10 but buy it on a sale.;Recommended;25.9;24/06/2020;457;11
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Action, Adventure;R$ 179,99;I'm giving this a good review because I liked it and plan to play through it again for giggles, but I'm going to start by saying I don't think everyone will enjoy this.  Here's why I liked it:1.  Shooting mechanics are pretty tight and intuitive.  I know that's really basic, but if it's off in a FPS that just kills it for me.2.  I love the premise.  This setting and the idea of this game just jives with me.  I'm fascinated by prepper culture and cults.  Riding around in a pickup truck shooting guns at a bunch of psychos with my redneck buddies is just my idea of a good time.3.  They actually tried really hard to give this game personality.  Thing is there's not a lot of acting in the game, it's not an RPG, but what's there is really solid.  They took great pains to make it really look like Montana.  You will hate the villains and you will like the good guys (Poor Jess!). they did a lot with very little.  Also the soundtrack of this game is freaking amazing, and it looks really good.4.  I'm a working adult, I like games I can play for 20 minutes and get something done.  I also like story driven FPS.  This works for me.Here's why I think other people wouldn't like it:1.  Very, very loose approach to the narrative.  If you are one of those people who loses interest in a show when the characters do something that doesn't strictly make logical sense, or you lose your mind when you encounter a plot hole, you're going to hate this.  If you can just kick back and say "it's just a game", or make up the reasons in your head why something happened, (i.e. you have a strong suspension of disbelief like I do) you'll be okay.  But a lot of things happen that just don't make any sense, if that bothers you, you won't like it.2.  The multiplayer aspects didn't thrill me, though I like the Arcade feature, that one's good, the rest... meh.3.  The bullet drop with sniper rifles drives some people crazy.4.  A friend of mine who tried this thought it was more like an RPG, and while it has a few light RPG style elements, it's not an RPG.  It's a shooter with some character customization.I highly recommend you buy it on sale, even if it sounds good to you.   I mean I've played more money for worse games, but at least this way if you don't like it you're not out too much.;Recommended;220.0;17/02/2020;171;7

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Action, Adventure;R$ 784,72;DISCLAIMER: I hate Ubisoft's open world games to an exponential degree and as such I had no interest in W_D2. However following the word of mouth, I got into the game a few weeks back. This review is for people who were burned by WD1 or just interested people in general  PROS: +Adapts a wider colour palette for San Francisco, ditching the depressing Greyish tone from WD1 altogether.+The option of completing the entire game non-lethally.+A casual, more light-hearted story that is self-aware and reflects upon the current Internet culture, with wacky characters.+Character customization is more diverse as opposed to the first game's preset clothing.+Radio towers, a plethora of collectibles and outposts have been removed altogether. +You have a lot more options with hacking. Call the SWAT on a NPC or place him on a gang's hitsquad. Cause a static vehicle to accelerate forward much to the surprise of the driver. This culminates in what people call Emergent Gameplay.+Online activities like Bounty hunter, Invasions and Co-op operations lend to longevity.+PC Version is also a significant step-up from first one. Favours numerous graphics options and a FOV slider. CONS: -Unsatisfying Gunplay. Customization of firearms is barebones.-Basic Stealth system. Cover mechanics is janky AF.-Braindead AI.-Vehicles controlling is more arcade-y. but improved from the first game.-Some rather bland mission designs. (Go to X, Hack Y, Watch a cutscene, Mission complete) VERDICT: Watch Dogs 2 came as a surprise to me. It got rid of a lot of stuff that Ubisoft is infamous for and opted for a better game world, the result is a far superior product than the previous title. It's not an absolute "OHMAGERD 10/10 GAYME HAS DOGES IN IT" that some people claim it to be but Ubisoft is making the right changes in its IPs, albeit little ones. If anyone is still on the fence after WD1, give this one a chance, you'll be fairly pleased.;Recommended;57.0;28/05/2017;576;15

Ubisoft;The Division 2;Action, Adventure, RPG;R$ 169,99;PSA To Everyone Wanting To Purchase This Title:   • Crashing Game has a terrible crashing issue for the majority of the player-base that's been going on for about 2 years now.People have tried fixing it themselves alongside Ubisoft Developers but all of the fixes seemed to be only temporary, a mere Windows Update or a Game Update could reintroduce the issue all over again, rendering the game unplayable for a lot of the players. (Ignore the trolls saying that it's a YOU issue, it isn't)  I've played the game on 3 different systems and I've had the same issue on all 3 of them, some better, some worse.There is an 8 hour trial of the game on Uplay, I'd strongly advise trying it out before purchasing as your system might be prone to crashing. • Ubisoft Connect The game opens up a "lite" version of Ubisoft Connect launcher in the background, I know some people don't like games which use third party launchers, so just throwing it out there.Furthermore, if you own the game on there, your progression is the same on Steam as long as your accounts are linked with one another.ALSO,  If you owned the Warlords of New York DLC on Uplay, you can purchase the Standard Edition of the game on Steam(without the DLC) and still have DLC within the game. • Potentially Slower Update Cycle? Game is mainly on life support, main team moved on to work on Star Wars/Avatar.Potentionally last year of support(Take this with a grain of salt, I am simply guessing based off of their social media) • Weird Paywall • Endgame locked behind a DLC paywall (Warlords of New York)If you decide against purchasing it you'll be stuck at level 30.  Positives:  • Decent time sinkEven after 1,000+ hours I've had things to do• A lot of different types of PvE activites of varying difficulties• Beautiful Open WorldBoth Washington D.C and New York have a ton of activities, collectables, etc..• Decent sense of progression• Good sound design• AI isn't dumbThey used to oneshot you across the map with a shotgun, they toned them down and now they're alright• Different types of builds with depth for different types of playersSniper, Shotgun, SMG, Skill builds, "Tank", Healer...• Pretty fair build making in generalYou can optimize and reroll gear as you wish with very few limitations• Works on Steam Deck (Disable DX12)  Mixed: • Bullet sponge enemiesIt isn't as bad as the first game and it's subjective to a lot of the things(Difficulty, what type of an enemy it is, your build)• Weak Story (It is a looter shooter, sort of expected)• Nerfs of "meta" gear, farming routes, yet hardly any buffsThere hasn't been any in a while, but it always felt like people in charge of this disliked players feeling powerful.• No AchievementsNot one I care about personally, but I see people complaining about it.If anything, there are achievements in game which grant you certain rewards.  Negatives: • No in-game matchmaking for RaidsThis wouldn't be such a big issue if there wasn't any gear locked behind this content.I also know some people just don't like going out of their way to find a group to do it with(Discord, Reddit...etc)• Performance could be better• PvP isn't its strong suit, and it clearly was an afterthought whilst creating the game.Current PTS changes have some interesting improvements in terms of it, but if you're buying this game and expecting fleshed out PvP experience, this game isn't for you.• You're sort of forced to purchase the DLC (WONY) if you want to do any of the actual EndGame content, there aren't that many players staying at level 30Final Thoughts & Would I Recommend The Game?Yes, without a doubt if the crashing is fixedIf you're serious about getting into the franchise, I'd strongly suggest getting the first game because it's an actual functional video game-Edit:  Will update the review if for some reason the Steam version of the game crashes less or at all -Edit 2:  Game crashed after 30 minutes of playtime, refunded -Edit 3:  I'll be deleting all of the comments which link old YouTube videos/Forum posts in the comments, it adds nothing to the conversation but misinformation.99% of these "fixes" are nothing more than placebo. -Edit 4: "So many negatives yet you gave it a positive review?"Yes, I did.I've spent thousands of hours playing/watching this game over the years, and it would feel unfair if I just completely disregarded all of that and went straight for the jugular.The game is fun and there is a ton of things to do/learn within it's world. (When it works)Considering the price tag of $18 for the whole package, this feels like a no-brainer decision.The main issue this game struggles with right now is the crashing, most of the other things can be ignored since they're prone to changing in the future (Like PvP for an example) -Edit 5:  Mr.Thunder  Consider making your own review rather than stealing this one, appreciate it. Thank you.;Recommended;74.3;12/01/2023;1,700;55

Electronic Arts;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Action, Adventure;R$ 199,00;Sum up+ Level design with proper amounts of exploration.+ Lightsaber combat is both fun and a spectacle to the eyes.+ Beautiful graphics that capture the atmosphere of Star Wars.+ Multiple paths to reach an objective, giving room to freedom and exciting turns in platforming.+ The soundtrack further elevates the game. it always fit the situations and manages to convey emotions of the case.+ Enemies and bosses are entertaining, from dealing with a more significant number of stormtroopers to facing Sith lords in intense duels.- Some technical problems in terms of glitches and optimization.-Specific skills are poorly balanced, such as "best friends," which gives force meter each time a stim is activated.- The story is excellent, but it lacks those critical moments in the beginning and the ending. Could have used more content to flesh the origin of Cal Kestis and his journey entirely. Introduction Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. It follows the story of Cal Kestis, a Jedi who survived order 66 by hiding in a planet as a scrap worker. It features elements from multiples sub-genres in the action category and incorporates them to elevate its gameplay further. From lightsaber combat to climbing and soul-likes bosses, the game grabs a bit from each of the best titles but not to the point those mechanics would obscure its own identity. Gameplay The combat is simple but also is a lot of fun. It has vast layers put into it that can appear rather lackluster at first. Still, they are intelligent choices from the developer. Cal Kestis has access to his lightsaber for physical combat and the force to open his options. Lightsaber techniques can range from throwing it towards enemies before it comes back. Different combos or forms, while the force can range from pushing back grenades towards enemies, force pulling, slowing enemies, and more.Players have a ton of options when facing the stormtroopers. You can push them off cliffs, throw them into one another, reflect beams at them, or cut them down with parries, to name just a few. It gives the player freedom to how they will approach any encounter with them or try new ideas. Hurl something at them, put them in front of their own blaster, forcing them towards you. The game has a lot of  possibilities.The platforming aspect of the game is also again, a successful decision in design. There are multiple ways to reach an objective on the map. For example, you can get to the next goal, die, take another path, and achieve that same destination. What is great about this is that those paths are very different when it comes to traveling itself and that they reward exploration. You can visit areas in the order you want, even as far as to go to planets you are not prepared for or discover secret places to visit later.It borrows aspects from games like Zelda, Metroid, Uncharted, Dark Souls. It then incorporates Cal Kestis mechanics into them to make them unique to the game. Puzzles and exploration being limited until you unlock new abilities, platforming that involves using the force to expand one's reach. Approach to level design, and finally combat that mixes dodging, parrying, smart use of the force and lightsaber combat.It is rewarding to be able to visit prior planets and discover that now you can take that path that was blocked before. Enemies being added in locations and exploring side stuff such as collectibles or hidden ways. Enemies have a defense meter, like a shield of sorts and until the player doesn't deplete that they won't be able to damage them. The combat is focused on reaction to how the player reacts to the enemy's attacks and groups of them. All of them have unblockable attacks, and bosses are ferocious with brutal powers and agile movements. Strong points The strong points are its story, that while it has some flaws, it is an enjoyable journey and manages to captivate what makes Star Wars so great as a franchise. The gameplay doesn't get boring because of new enemies showing up from time to time, keeping it fresh, along with the variety of options the player has. Bosses are exciting, particularly the last ones are hard to beat, and they give intense duels.The integration of elements from other games is a concept that I like. Bringing a more refined quality in gameplay but also being careful not to let those elements get to carried away and making the game into a copy of those other games. Finally, customization while the ponchos and ship can be some recolors. the lightsabers have a lot of customization into them. All colors are present except for red. you can change the hilt. The material, the handle, just about everything about them, and let's be honest lightsabers are very cool. It allows one to personalize the aesthetics of Cal Kestis to suit their particular tastes. Story The plot revolves around Cal Kestis, a young man who works to earn his living on a planet controlled by the empire. The plot follows up after the purge of the Jedi after order 66, and Kestis being a Jedi padawan, spends most of his days in hiding. One day, however, he is discovered by the empire. After escaping certain death, he ends up meeting Cere Junda, a former Jedi who managed to escape the Purge of Order 66 and the pilot Greez Ditus, the Mantis ship's owner.Without spoiling too much, the story is good, but both the beginning and the ending of it lack specific amounts of flesh. The start of the game is sprung while the end is abrupt. However, the rest of it is rich in detail, with information on the planets that you visit, references to famous characters and events. Good pacing that allows for character development and for the player to get to know these characters.The exploration of planets adds layers to the lore game, especially if you already heard of them before. The story has the premises of a Star Wars film. Comedic moments that can give a laugh or darker ones that can emanate conflicting thoughts or uncertainty of how things will play out. It is fantastic and one of the best aspects of the game. Some Notes The games run faulty on a GTX 1060. it runs okay in a GTX 1070 and anything above that it runs flawlessly. I could notice that in 1060, there were a lot of frame drops, so I would not recommend it for GTX 1060 users unless you don't mind playing in 30 FPS, which is less than ideal. There are also some bugs such as getting stuck in a wall or BD never turning off the scanner light, but those were few, rare instances.UPDATE: So users report the game doing well on a GTX 1060, while others said it has lots of frame drops. In our experience, the game did not run well on a 1060 but it did on a 1070. If you have a 1060, you will have to try it yourself to see if it runs well or not. Conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is probably one of the best games released in 2019. While the game doesn't manage to make something revolutionary or unique, it certainly knows how to add other elements and taking them into what Star Wars means. The combat, while simple, has a lot of freedom build into it, and the platforming-backtracking is excellent. Whenever you are a Star Wars fan or not, this is a game that you should consider getting.If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/;Recommended;13.1;26/11/2019;954;49
Electronic Arts;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Action, Adventure;R$ 199,00;Jedi Fallen Order is, by quite a big margin, the most surprising title of the year for me, not only compared to the expectations I had for it, which were admittedly pretty low, but for how genuinely brilliant this game achieves to be.It's true, Fallen Order really looks like a greatest hits of all the major and most appreciated mechanics we've seen in single player videogames in the last few years: we have bombastic cinematic moments took straight from the Uncharted series (if you played Uncharted 2, you'll probably find the first hour of the game to be hilarious, in that sense), tombs with puzzles to solve and walls to jump onto that seem borrowed from the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy, a combat system very similar to what we recently saw in Sekiro by From Software but, thankfully, they never end up falling in the "been there, done that" zone and they always feel extremely polished and cohesively combined, returning us a fantastic experience that is far more than the sum of its parts. The level design by Respawn is also top notch, with an intricate map design that is both a joy to explore in every corner the first time, in order to find secrets and hidden optional enemies, and fun to return to once you unlocked those abilities you were missing and that you can now use to reach places you couldn't get to before. The difficulty is well balanced and, at the hardest setting, it gives you a nice challenge without resulting too frustrating: this is definitely the difficulty to pick if you're experienced with action games like Sekiro. The story is coherent and serviceable, enriched by a cast of interesting characters you'll most likely want to know more about (sadly our main guy isn't one of them, that is the one thing that never changed from my initial impressions). On the technical side the game is also very solid, with great graphics and an extremely polished PC port. the only issues I encountered during my playthrough were all due to the integration with Origin, which is something they really can't drop soon enough. All things considered, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a brilliant game that everyone should at least consider playing, even if they're not particularly interested in the Star Wars universe (I'm not a massive fan of the saga myself). Great job, Respawn!;Recommended;25.9;6/12/2019;479;28
Electronic Arts;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Action, Adventure;R$ 199,00;I am so proud of Respawn Entertainment.I don't want to discredit them whatsoever, when I say that I was worried EA would step on their toes and sabotage this game in order to prove the narrative of 'people don't want singleplayer games'Yet against all odds, they made such an amazingly wonderful experience that feels like a true, real game.This company is proof that there's life in EA, Filled with people who care if they would just be left alone to create experiences. I FEEL like a Jedi... not infinitely powerful, but, one who's vulnerable, scared, and learning to survive and thrive. I feel empowered. I feel rewarded. I feel like Luke... but I am Cal. And being Cal is a wonderful, beautiful experience, from the graphics to the music to the subtle world-building.... Respawn  made magic.They deserve your attention, and you deserve to experience this wonderful, beautiful story. Please don't miss out on this.;Recommended;34.1;19/11/2019;885;28

Electronic Arts;Battlefield V;Action;R$ 229,00;I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.I bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!Every single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??It's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!;Not Recommended;587.4;4/08/2021;2,192;72
Electronic Arts;Battlefield V;Action;R$ 229,00;Plagued by hackers, almost no oceania community, devs don't care, hackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still haven't been banned. Lazy.Edit: Wow this review got a lot more publicity than I expected! That being said, now that I've played a bit more I'd like to revise my initial thoughts. Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good game, the bullet ballistics are good, team work and strategy is good, the graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good. But all this is over-arched by critical flaws that I'm guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasn't likely to be as profitable as they were expecting. Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency. Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few "specializations" for each weapon, mostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things. The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers. They obviously knew their time wouldn't make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best. There's a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement. It's been abandoned, players don't get banned, reports don't get answered. If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield series, there's definetly fun to be had but heres a few tips:* Avoid official servers: that's right, the official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers. EA you should be ashamed.* Consider avoiding if you live in a remote area: In Australia today I was able to find just 1 conquest server with 40 players and able to at least play the game (10AM on a Wednesday). I really can't guarantee that there will be any player base if you live somewhere more exotic than Australia, USA and Europe are probably okay. Don't count on being able to find a server if you're a night owl like me.Overall this game had a lot of potential but it stands as a hollow shell of what it could have been. I liked the inclusion of female characters and being able to play as someone who I felt more of a connection to but the amount of hostility EA showed towards their player base was uncalled for and instead of making up for it they took the money and ran.;Not Recommended;54.0;29/06/2020;1,113;55
