0;Action;00,00;After 8 years playing it, I didn't improve my skills in-game.However, I learned new language skills: now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese.Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as Очи чёрные (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.Better than any psychiatric therapy. 10/10;1;2628,8;10/12/2020;1838;1572

1;Action;00,00;If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.Let me put that into perspective:  541 Days and 16 Hours.  Of dota 2. I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was "addicted" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.But I've also relatively learned nothing.Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people,  because  of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: "what if I just did ... instead" or "what if I just played on a more casual level". The issue is, that dota  feels  more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.Thank you for all that you  have  done for me. Farewell friend.;1;13084,9;23/04/2022;669;22

1;Action;00,00;"You learn how to learn,  how to lose and most importantly you learn about you."Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.1. general thoughts and how i started:I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying "nothing" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts "lets learn music"  or "lets study" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of "improving" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of "oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.." at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat;1;9569,2;13/04/2018;828;100
2;Action; 162,00;This game is highly engaging and you feel like you are in Alyx's world.  It is difficult but not too difficult even for a 67 year old gamer like me :);1;48,8;24/05/2020;2181;172
2;Action; 162,00;Bought VR  INDEX for retirement. Son built me a gaming computer. Took 8 months for a graphics card. (decent price). All lit up! First game was Half Life. Can't play anything else. I was spoiled to other games without a doubt. I'm a newbie to all this. But the graphics, sounds, gunfights, humor, etc...., was exhilarating. I will often just stay in an area and check out the detailing for 10-15 minutes. Relax. Then KILL again!;1;598,7;5/11/2021;895;49
2;Action; 162,00;Honestly - if you are just getting into VR, I'd recommend waiting a bit with this game and to start with other VR games. Why? Because this is not only the best VR game on the market right now, it is years ahead of every other game. Playing this as your first VR game will make every other game feel like a letdown.;1;38,5;14/12/2020;1263;78
2;Action; 162,00;10/10 would wait 15 years again.EDIT: Well, this is getting more eyes than expected and that sounded bad. In a nut-shell, I really love this game, here's my experience, spoiler free so far:The first 10 seconds were breathtaking, literally. I've been playing VR since 2018, a lot of games, and while the first moments of it were amazing, the feeling of presence went down a bit as I went along, playing more games. But this, this is something else. The attention to detail is amazing.Performance is fantastic, I don't really know how they manage to pull that quality and achieve steady 90 fps. That's a technical achievement for sure.As for world interaction / controls, they are the best they can possible be. I've played Boneworks and having physics everywhere is kinda interesting, but just as a concept. Going up a ladder in Boneworks or climbing was awful. The rest was good.HL:A merges the best of two worlds. There's physical interactions for moments where they are needed, but they won't get in your way at all. And I really love that, because is just a frigging game, not a simulation. For example, going up a ladder here, is simple. Opening a door too. It won't get smashed in your face, only features necessary collisions. Also I really love how they went all in and gave physic properties to some enemies. That increases immersion by tons!The hacking puzzles, I had my expectations low, but oh boy, I was really wrong. They are quite fun to do, they are challenging but not tiresome. They provide random patterns so the challenge always stay fresh.The sounds are amazing, I had to take my helmet because I thought a rat came into my room. Then I thought it was a faulty hard disk. Nope. It was the game. I believe the sound experiments they did with CS:GO carried over here and it really shows. Character voices were a bit loud tho.The Half-Life winks are amazing. And for someone who played them all, spent 10 years making a HL mod and basically kickstart a game dev career, it was tear inducing.My only complain is the ammo system. While I love the Tresspasser reference ("Two mags left!") I really wish I could store back some pistol ammo. I thought that was going to bit a bit more arcade-y, but it's okay, it really helps to build up some tension.I was going to try the game for a bit, ended up playing like 5 hours straight. Couldn't really put it down.The upgrade system is a nice addition. Also for the different enemy types. It's an evolved Half-Life in every way, and is what I expected and much much more.Now, I will get a bit sad for other companies, because they set the bar incredibly high.AAA VR games will be like this, or better, and can't say how really happy that makes me.Go and play it right now and be part of history as this is the VR break trough everybody expected.;1;49,5;24/03/2020;2321;372
2;Action; 162,00;Valve made me spend almost 400 dollars to play this game and the worst part is that its worth every penny;1;42,3;12/12/2023;595;75
2;Action; 162,00;Half life Alyx is the best reintroduction into the Half Life universe possible.  Even though Valve says this isn't HL3. this most certainly is.  I played with a Oculus CV1 comfortably. Even on low fidelity settings, the game looked beautiful. 13 years was definitely worth waiting for this masterpiece. Unfortunately, My Father, who introduced me to the half life series, passed in 2016 to brain cancer and never got to see such an amazing title and what the future of gaming will be.  I love you dad.;1;17,1;20/04/2020;808;33
2;Action; 162,00;Valve casually releases the best VR game and disappears again.;1;16,2;21/02/2024;426;60
2;Action; 162,00;I can barely form words after the ending of this game. I will never spoil it for people who have not gotten there yet, so I wont go further into it.This game is a literal masterpiece. From the visuals, to the music, to the story that leaves you questioning everything, Valve has managed to create a VR title set in the Half-Life universe, that rivals all other Half-Life titles. Valve, Half-Life and their other titles saved me from a very dark time 13 years ago. And every Valve title that comes out I give my full attention. This game brought back the feelings of mystery, wonder, and concern on how my favorite characters were going to end up. Even with the knowledge of future events, as this is a prequel, it left you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The story was brilliantly written, and no one could have for seen where it was going. A pivotal roll in Half-Life's overall story and a must play for any fan of the franchise. The graphics were absolutely stunning, and the Source Engine has been changed for the better. Comparing Source with Source 2 is like Source Gold with Source. Stunning difference! Physics are still wonky from time to time, but this made me appreciate it even more. Just like old times!Valve seems to already be on top of patches, so I'll leave the little bugs alone as they have been updating it pretty often over the last few days.I have some issues with how it functions for lower end headsets, like the Samsung Plus, as grenade throwing can be a bit wonky with the controllers going outside the camera's zone. But I don't really think this Valve related per-say, though the amount of times you need to USE grenades could be a bit lower. But all in all, for a lower end Windows headset like mine, I don't have many grips. Controls worked flawlessly and all responded correctly. I used continuous motion but I did find myself using the Teleport to get to places quicker. So a nice medium mix between the two was my sweet spot. Lots of options to mess around with, especially if you get motion sick.I must point out the VAST amount of options you have available. Valve thought of a lot of people with this title to appeal to as many as they could. From Colorblind options to Light Sensitivity for people who suffer from Epilepsy. You can even play with one hand. Teleport, Smooth Motion, and Hybrids are BOTH options. So people who like either one, or both, can use what they are comfortable with. Valve just added Smooth Turning and they also have snap turning if it makes you motion sick. Play around with it, you'll find your sweet spot.All in all, for any Half-Life and Valve fan, this is a MUST! If you don't have a VR to play it, go grab a cheaper one and experience it for yourself. You DON'T NEED an Index to play this game! If you're sure VR is not your thing, go watch a play through on YouTube and support Valve to keep encouraging them to make more games like Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. They seem to have their spark back, and by the gods the STILL have what it takes to make masterpiece games.This final message, though I know they will never see it, is a Thank you to Valve. Thank you for making this game. Thank you for taking me back to a time where I discovered this series. And thank you for continuing to influence my life with all the things you have done for us! Please keep making games, and Thank you so much!;1;46,2;25/03/2020;1441;24
2;Action; 162,00;This is the best vr game I know of. This is an actual game. This is what vr is supposed to be.;1;97,4;1/10/2020;605;11
2;Action; 162,00;About 3 hours in, I need to take a break. Here are my initial thoughts in easily-digestible point-by-point form:The game's tech outperformed even my pretty significant expectations. It's by far the best looking (and sounding) VR game I've played. Crucially, the image quality is fantastic, with absolutely no visible aliasing outside of very extreme cases of fine specular detail. And despite all that it maintains a pretty solid 144 (!!) FPS. Sure, I have a fast PC, but it's still a highly competent showing from the engine.The grabbity gloves are an absolutely amazing mechanic. The first 2 times I tried to use them it was a bit awkward, and my reaction was a slightly disappointed "hmm, that's it?". The third time it felt better. The fourth time it felt absolutely amazing. And from that point on I just grabbed and threw stuff around everywhere without even thinking about it. This is an extremely polished mechanism of interaction.The attention to detail is great. From startling the cat from the first balcony, over the extremely cool looking puzzles to the interactions with NPCs, to the major scenes, all of it looks like it had a lot of care put into it.Even Valve doesn't have access to magic. While the physics are better (more stable and more conducive to smooth gameplay) than anything else I've played, it's still not too hard to make things explode.Headcrabs. ♥♥♥♥ those.Overall, I can already confidently say that everyone who has access to a VR system should absolutely play this game.;1;4,6;23/03/2020;2007;73
3;Action; 4,49;The first Portal had genius, original gameplay mechanics, great story, great level progression, great voice acting, great characters, great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 1, you are a bad person.This sequel brings all those qualities to a new level: _the story is deep_, lots of wow moments, graphics is beautiful, much more levels, environments and elements to solve the puzzles, the co-op multiplayer is so fun it's epic.In my heart and in my mind I have no doubt: _this is the best game ever made_.If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 2, you understand nothing about videogames.;1;6,5;11/06/2017;2977;93

3;Action; 4,49;Congratulations! The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to sciencePortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I’ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn’t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to T2: Judgement Day when it comes to rating sequels. I’ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.Pros+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can’t think of any game topping this. +Stephen Merchant and J.K Simmons did an absolutely terrific job. Ellen McLain’s performance as GladOS is so good that you’ll love to hate her character. So, then it’s a success I guess :D+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It’s funny, it’s dark but most importantly it’s original!+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by Mike Morasky and The National. +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you’re done with the main story. +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it’s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you’re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There’s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don’t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. Cons-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you’ve watched a lot of movies and TV.-Most assets seem like they’re copied straight from previous Valve’s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. -Honestly, I’ve tried hard to find and couldn’t. At this point I’m just nitpicking Valve.  The Bottom LinePortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there’s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson. perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I’m thankful for that.The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer. Highly recommend it to……everyone. If you’ve read so far then you’re probably interested in the game so won’t hurt giving it a try. My Rating: 10/10  Thank You :D;1;31,4;28/06/2020;288;27

4;Action; 179,99;As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.I should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  So right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  None of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.What kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  I’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.The team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.I’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  I wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.Okay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.The hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  Also I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  I won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  If you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.;1;418,7;24/01/2019;2483;115
4;Action; 179,99;After my experience with AC: Origins, I was reluctant to buy this game. It looked almost the same as Origins to me, and as somebody who wasn't particularly fond of Origins, that wasn't a good sign. Nevertheless, I had quite a bit of money left in my Steam wallet so I decided to buy it.I can safely say that I don't regret my purchase. This game is remarkable and has been a massive surprise to me. It took everything that Origins had, made it better, and threw in some of its own stuff as well. It feels a lot more fleshed out than any of the previous games in the entire franchise. Graphics Unsurprisingly, the game world is beautifully designed. I loved Origins' game world, but I have to say that Odyssey's game world is a lot better. It is a lot more vibrant, and it is incredibly easy to get lost in it. There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.The map mostly consists of islands and has you sail from island to island with your own ship. The islands are placed in appropriate distances, making travel between them not too much of a hassle. The map is huge. I'm 76 hours in and I haven't fully discovered it all yet. The amount of detail they put into it is nothing short of incredible.The game's cinematography overall is a major improvement from Origins. Cutscenes are a lot more interesting to watch through and generally make the game more engaging. Animations, although not perfect, are still better from previous games, aside from a few over-exaggerated animations. My main issue in the graphical department is the poor rendering. Textures can sometimes fail to load in properly and the draw distance is far from impressive.  Story The story in Odyssey is surprisingly quite good for the most part. You have the choice of playing as Alexios or Kassandra. It doesn't really make too much of a difference which one you play, so for my playthrough I chose Kassandra. Either way, you play as a mercenary in ancient Greece during the Pelponesian War, a time of great struggle between the Athenians and the Spartans.The story starts off basic but it begins to escalate pretty quickly. The first chapter of the game is brilliantly concluded, and after that I found myself hooked. There are three story branches that the game has you follow. You acquire these new branches as you progress through the story. I'm not going to talk about these branches in this review because I honestly think you should discover what they are for yourselves when you play this. What they are, and the way they are revealed, are brilliant. The more you go through the game, the more content is available to you. It can get overwhelming sometimes.Mutliple choice dialogue is a brilliant addition to Assassin's Creed in my opinion and it makes you feel like you have way more of an impact on the story and the characters. It may not drastically change the course of the game, but the things you say do have consequences.Does the story retain this level of charm? No, not really. Once you reach the half way point of the game, it begins to fall a bit flat. It's not that it becomes bad, it's just not as good. The level of mystery begins to become a bit stale and the structure of the main quests begins to be a little repetitive. You find yourself having to do other needless things before being able to do the main quest, which can get annoying. As well as this. the ending to the main story branch is a bit weak, and honestly a bit cheesy. The outside Animus story returns, which was something that was incredibly forgetable in Origins. It's still not that great, but it's more interesting in Odyssey and the conclusion to it is excellent.Despite that, the story overall is good, and that goes for all three story branches. The writing in Odyssey is engaging and I find myself liking the missions and the characters, which is something that Origins struggled to do for me. Gameplay If you've played Origins, you will notice a lot of similarities when it comes to gameplay. The combat is very similar, and some of the other game mechanics that were in Origins are present in Odyssey as well. What makes them different in Odyssey, is that they've been drastically improved. The game has fully embraced its RPG side which means it isn't holding back on anything. You can play the game using guided mode, or exploration mode. Guided mode is essentially what Origins was with a compass and icons pointing to where you need to go. Exploration mode removes all of this and makes you figure out where you need to go with the tips you've been given from talking to people or finding notes or letters. This makes the game a lot more challenging and serves as a way more memorable experience to say the least.Just like Origins, the combat is really entertaining. You can fight using a variety of different weapons and the introduction of combat abilities makes these fights a lot more exhilarating. You gain a skill point each time you level up which can be used to invest in these abilities. Executions aren't as impressive in this game as they were in previous titles. Sometimes the animations don't exactly line up, resulting in the whole thing looking goofy. Assassination executions can sometimes screw you over and get you spotted by other enemies, which can get pretty annoying.Sea combat is a much more prominent feature in this game since a big portion of the map is ocean. Sea combat was something that I wasn't a fan of in previous games, but Odyssey has done it almost perfectly. It's simple, and it can be really exciting. Your ship can be upgraded using resources, and the more you upgrade, the better your ship can sustain itself. During your travels, you can recruit new people to join your ship. These people will give your ship bonuses and will assist you in boarding other ships.The game world is split into different regions. Each region is either controlled by the Athenians or the Spartans. One of Odyssey's new game mechanics is the implementation of conquest battles. To unlock a conquest battle, you need to weaken the hold of the controlling faction. Once a conquest battle is unlocked, you can begin a massive battle that will decide who controls the region. You have the ability to choose which side you want to be with. As well as this, Odyssey introduces bounty hunters. If you commit a crime and it has been witnessed, you risk placing a bounty on yourself. This will send a bounty hunter after you. They are smart and very powerful, and can show up when you least expect it.  Grind? I needed to include this as for me, this was a major issue in Origins, and almost made me give up on it. Throughout my playthrough, I rarely had the need to grind, and when I did, it was hardly any hassle for me at all, as the ways you can level up are plentiful and entertaining. The amount of XP you gain increases the more you level up, which is a brilliant way to tackle grind. If you don't rush, you shouldn't have an issue. Final Recommendation I'm running out of room to type things so I'll conclude it here. Overall, I'm really pleased with this game. I'm glad it didn't end up being an Origins 2.0. The writing is good and the characters are memorable. The game world is stunning and is filled with things to do. The only things that drag this game down for me are the poor rendering and the poor mid-late story pacing. If you're willing to pay the price tag, this is definitely a game you shouldn't miss. Pros-Stunning Game World-Interesting Story-Well thought-out RPG mechanics -Tons of things to do-Exhilarating CombatCons-Lame mid-late game pacing-Poor rendering-Executions aren't greatFinal Rating - 8.6/10If you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

4;Action; 179,99;Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity. an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with added light roleplaying, MUCH better combat, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development as, superficially, roleplaying and story are more developed. However, a lot of this comes to naught, because most of the side quests are still boring, filler fetch quests, and a lot of the "decisions" you have to make are little more than window-dressing: the illusion of choice rather than actual choice. I reloaded saves only to realize that the same thing happens in most instances no matter which choice you make. While it's nice to have the option to select dialogue this time around, story and roleplaying still clearly need more work put into them to deliver on the promise of better story and writing.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another. chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds solid new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!;1;234,8;5/10/2018;1524;32
4;Action; 179,99;Odyssey is truly a long and adventurous journey  ⏰ How long to beat Assassin's Creed: Odyssey:              - Main Story - 43½ Hours              - Main + Extras - 83 Hours               - Completionist - 137 Hours By this point, this is the longest Assassin's Creed I've played to date, with over what I was hoping to be. The world itself is massive, and you will spend close to what I've spent, if not more, if you want to repeat the game on Game Plus on the other character (Kasandra or Alexios).In the beginning, the game felt nothing like Assassin's Creed and the whole direction really left me feeling a bit empty as I didn't click right away with Alexios. It took me at least 50 hours into the game to get used to him and how he was as a character to later in the game actually appreciate, value and really like who he has become.The main campaign was nice, but what really topped up my entire enjoyment was the DLC's that I will be talking about later in this review. ⚔ Gameplay: 🔲 It's a one-time experience☑️ Only for achievements🔲 If you wait a few months/years (try playing with mods)🔲 Definitely🔲 Infinitely replayableThe game contains a lot of side quests and side missions that will keep you engaged for over 150 hours if you're a completionist. If you want to replay the game, you can seek the Game Plus after you finish the whole game, but unless you want to see the alternative, I don't see why you'd want to do it.The game itself expands on the previous instalment AC: Origins, intending to upgrade it. Unfortunately for me, I feel that Origins was a superior game in terms of gameplay as I enjoyed more the setting and the skills in the game early in the game. 😄 Fun: 🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry🔲 Hard to enjoy☑️ Repetitive☑️ Actually pretty amusing🔲 The kind of fun you'll remember🔲 Ride of your lifeAs a big fan of the series and of the RPG genre, I can say that I have enjoyed this game more and more as deeply as I got into the game. I really believe that Odyssey needs time on for players to fully value the work Ubisoft has put into and ignore the fact that it no longer aligns with the direction once Assassin's Creed became.It keeps the old elements of Parkour and assassinations but doesn't expand on them, yet this game really does a great job with the beautiful world and lore behind it.If you love Greek Mythology, you will find this game fascinating to explore and enjoy. I know I sure did. 🏞 Graphics: 🔲 MS Paint🔲 Bad🔲 Meh🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game🔲 Good (nothing special)☑️ Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceThe graphics of this game are gorgeous, and I needed to upgrade my PC's CPU to play it to its fullest details fully. The world is gorgeously crafted, and I can't give credit enough to Ubisoft for the beautiful work. 🔊 Sound: 🔲 Makes your ears bleed🔲 Bad☑️ Not special🔲 Good🔲 Beautiful🔲 MasterpieceI felt that as the new RPG era progressed, the whole world felt a bit bland and not so much alive. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the music and the ambient sounds of this world, but it's not bad either. Voice acting can sometimes feel off, but that's because this game contains hundreds of characters that needed voice acting, and I can understand that this may be why sometimes it feels like it could have spent more time in the oven. 📖 Story: 🔲 This game has no story🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story🔲 It's there for the people who want it🔲 Well written☑️ Epic story🔲 MasterpieceWithout spoiling anything, I'd like to point out that this game takes time to grow on you regarding the story. It does a great job at creating emotions between you and characters along the way, and with the 3 DLC's you are bombarded with beautiful finishing touches of the great story.I felt most intrigued playing the DLC's because they were topping down on areas of the game that left me craving to know more about Alexios's story, and I appreciate that.I can tell you that despite the criticism regarding the direction the game takes you, on its own, you will enjoy it. The most enjoyable part of all the other Assassin's Creed's I've played is that your decisions actually matter. 🧵 Length: 🔲 Long enough for a cup of coffee🔲 Short🔲 Average☑️ Long (if u can even finish it)🔲 To infinity and beyondAccording to Ubisoft Connect 188 hours, the game took me, but Steam recorded 283. It's a long game, and at some point, it felt like it was never-ending. I thought I could finish it a lot sooner, but the long journeys between objectives and if you're a completionist like myself, you'll spend about the same time.I wish it would be shorter. 💷 Price: 🔲 Free🔲 Underpriced☑️ Perfect Price☑️ Could be cheaper🔲 Overpriced🔲 Complete waste of moneyDepending on the Edition you want to buy the game under, it can get pretty pricy. I recommend getting the Ultimate Edition through a Sale, as it's a bit too much. Do know that by spending less than £40, you will be spending a lot of time in the game. If you love the world and all, you'll feel that the price for the game is just perfect as you got a lot of content to explore. 🧩 Difficulty: 🔲 My 90-year-old grandma could play it🔲 Easy☑️ Normal☑️ Hard🔲 Dark Souls (if u play with bell demon and charmless it's extremely hard)At times the game can spike in difficulty, especially with the issue of Level differences. You will find yourself struggling with enemies that are levels above you, but as you get better at the game and unlock skills and better gear, you can expect to dominate the battlefield even when facing foes 5-10 levels than you.I don't want to brag, but I have managed to defeat an enemy ten levels above me, with a few trials and errors. So, if you're persistent, you can do it too. ⚖ Pros & Cons:  ➕ Pros: + The World is Gorgeous and you'll have a lot to explore.+ If you're a fan of Mythology or Greek Mythology, you'll love this game.+ The story with the DLC's are nicely written, even though it focuses less on the ideology of Assassin's Creed.+ You get to have a lot of items and gear to mix around and play.+ Some romantic moments here and there, and you can enjoy them all. ➖ Cons: - It's not what Assassin's Creed used to be, and this may be a turn off for some fans.- Too long. I really wish it would be shorter.- The world and the people may seem big, but sometimes I wish the cities felt more alive.- Voice acting can be quite poor at times and can kick you out of the emersion.- I wish the main story Cultists were a lot more similar to what the DLC (Legacy of the First Blade) did to give them a lot more reason behind being in the cult. only a few of them get that treatment. ⚙ Bugs: 🔲 Never heard of☑️ Minor bugs🔲 Can get annoying🔲 ARK: Survival Evolved🔲 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsI've encountered a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that would bother me. I've got a couple of crashes in my entire playthrough. I would think about 5-6 in total. Not too serious. The game sometimes gets overwhelmed and simply crashes for me. That was more often when my CPU bottlenecked my GPU. ⭕Conclusion: AC Odyssey is a beautiful assassin's creed game that focuses more and more on the lore of the Cultists (Templars) and their origins. While AC Origins focused on the beginning of the hidden ones, Odyssey focuses more on the begging of the Cult to create a reason behind it.If you want to explore a gorgeous world filled with mystery, mythology and magic, you may enjoy Odyssey a lot more than you think.Originally posted by TalePlay: If you've read this far, I want to say thank you and do check our Curator Page called TalePlay.

4;Action; 179,99;I bought the Gold Edition, which seems to have a better value. Here's some info on the different editions:Standard Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game) DELUXE DIGITAL PACK: - Kronos pack - contains the full Armour of Kronos armour set, the Hourglass mount, and the spear "Harvester of Time" - this pack gives more warrior damage boost- Herald of Dusk pack - contains the full Herald of Dusk set of armour, and the Dusk Blood Offering sword - this pack is more stealth focused.- Capricornus Naval Pack - contains the Capricornus boat and sailor skins - purely cosmetic.- Temporary boosts to XP and money - boost lasts for 2 hours.Gold Edition Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)SEASON PASS: LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE, THE FATE OF ATLANTIS and bonus mission The Secrets of Greece + The Games: Assassin's Creed III REMASTERED and Assassin's Creed Liberation REMASTERED. Ultimate Edition (Digital) Assassin's Creed: Odyssey (Base Game)Digital Deluxe Edition - Check the Content Info AboveSEASON PASS - Check the Content Info AboveSo, the only difference between Gold and Ultimate Edition is that Ultimate has the Deluxe Edition Content. Unless you want to spend extra money to receive the deluxe pack for temporary xp boost and some armor and skins (the armour looks really cool and is useful after level 5 and not really useful after level 8 - upgrading it at the blacksmith takes too much resources and there is much better armor later on. up to you to buy Ultimate vs Gold Edition - price difference is not as big when on sale, though I bought Gold Edition) then I'd suggest you to get the Gold Edition.Note:  You can not upgrade to Deluxe Edition later on, meaning if you buy the base game or the Gold Edition and decide you want the Deluxe Edition later - you will be rebuying the game again with the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition, and that's money wasted. Buying the base game with the intention to buy Season Pass or any of the other editions later on, is not worth it at all either - buy Ultimate Edition to have absolutely everything or buy the Gold Edition to have everything important gameplay-wise. You are saving money and getting the best of the game. For Season Pass owners (which is in the Gold and Ultimate Editions) - Assassin's Creed Liberation Remastered will not appear in your library as it is a part of, and available only through Assassin's Creed III Remastered. So, in order to play Liberation Remastered, you need to launch Assassin's Creed III Remastered. Both Remasters are slightly better graphically, than their previous versions. You have to launch Assassin's Creed Odyssey once, before trying to launch the remastered content because Ubisoft Connect needs to load the content that comes with the Gold/Ultimate Edition. Otherwise, the Ubisoft client will ask you for a cd key activation, which is not possible anymore.  For any problems with the Ubisoft client: Verify Integrity of Game Files on Steam and if it doesn't work then uninstall the Ubisoft client and delete the current version and redownload the client from the Ubisoft site. If you still have problems then God help you dealing with Ubisoft/Steam support. The latter has a faster response but both suffer from the same level of retardation.Hopefully, the info will help you, so you don't have to look around various sites or contact the terrible support teams.Ps: If you are interested, feel free to check my Assassin's Creed Black Flag Review - https://steamcommunity.com/id/brake_id/recommended/242050/;1;5,6;19/03/2021;256;3

6;Action; 179,99;(DRM notice: this game requires a Uplay account, requires you to connect to Uplay when starting up, and it also uses Denuvo DRM. DRM is inherently bad for the customer so I wanted to warn you about that.)Far Cry 5 is a decent entry into the series, and often underrated in comparison to previous titles.Honestly, if you played Far Cry 2, 3 or 4 - you know what to expect. Same game, different setting. The main reason people rate it lower than 3 and 4 is because by this point, they've grown tired of the same old formula (and because of the weird ending, but I'm not gonna spoil that... you have to see it for yourself). Far Cry 5 is just as good as its predecessors. That said, let's give this a proper analysis, shall we?You shoot bad guys. This time it's in rural America.It's a Far Cry game. What did you expect? It follows the Ubisoft open world formula of a big world occupied by enemy forces, which you slowly liberate by wiping out enemy outposts like you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rambo. There's a basic but functional stealth system of silent melee takedowns, silent weapons like bows, throwing knives, and silenced guns, and enemies raising the alarm if they see you or find a dead body. You can conquer outposts either by going in slow and methodical, or you can just storm in guns blazing and mow everyone down with an MG. The combat is fun. Controls are pretty smooth, most weapons are satisfying to use, and neither you nor the enemy are bullet sponges. Sometimes you will have to deal with enemy helicopters, or you can fly one yourself to rain death from above. Fun!The only criticism I have compared to earlier Far Cry titles (especially Far Cry 1 and 2) is how the physics engine has been dialed down a bit. Many items are static objects that don't ever move (I kicked a bunch of cans and they just stayed in place... lame), and most cover can't be pierced by bullets, unlike earlier games where thin wooden walls could easily be penetrated by high caliber weaponry. At least the fire spreading mechanics are still there, making the flamethrower a potentially devastating weapon... with which you can easily grill yourself if you're not careful.The game is set in Hope County, a fictional area in the US state of Montana, where a crazy cult is taking over and forcibly recruiting the population. You arrive as a policeman (or policewoman, this is the first Far Cry game with character customization and you get to pick your gender) coming to arrest the leader of that cult, but of course the cultists fight back and you have to run. During the course of the game, you meet with various resistance members and help them fight the cult until they are wiped off the map. The setting is quite enjoyable, especially if you like rural America. As a European, I find American culture quite fascinating, and this game is full of it. All the resistance people are proud American patriots, and you get to see a lot of those weird roadside attractions they have in the rural US, like a park with giant plastic mammoth statues and farms that advertise their tomatoes with giant tomato signs. Very quaint.I got captured... AGAINAs far as the story structure is concerned, the antagonists are pretty interesting and the story overall is competently told. But the way they force you into the main quest missions... yeah, that's definitely questionable. Whenever you earn enough "Resistance Points" in a region (by doing side quests or liberating outposts), the bad guys will send a capture party to abduct you. They don't just do it once per region, but several times. When I finished the game, I had been captured at least six times... and if we count the scenes where Faith puts you into a drug-induced trance so she can try and convert you to the cult, that increases to nine times.Nine. Times.And each time, you - of course - manage to escape and kill a whole bunch of cultists in the process. They should have realized that keeping you alive is a bad idea after the second time, but nope. They just keep abducting you and try to convert you to their cause, until you finally kill all the leaders. Of all the methods they could have used to drive the story forward, this is by far the dumbest. It almost feels like the bad guys are deliberately giving you a chance over and over again.The cult leaders are appropriately vile and violent characters, and the acting and animation is really good. I usually hate cutscenes, but I found the ones in Far Cry 5 to be quite engaging, because the characters are so interesting. I have to rate the main story as "good", but... the way they keep using that abduction mechanic to drive the plot forward... that's just stupid. So utterly stupid. And the worst part is that it can hit you anywhere once you triggered it. Doing a sidequest right now? Haha sorry, abduction squad is here. Flying around in a helicopter? Yeah there's a sedative arrow in your leg now, don't ask where it came from. It's just dumb.You've seen it before. It's nothing new, but it's good.Really, apart from the dumb way they handled the main story progression with those stupid abduction scenes, Far Cry 5 doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's another competently made Far Cry game. More of the same for people who enjoy this style of game. Open world driving around, shooting bad guys, doing side quests. It even has the same mission types as the previous Far Crys: rescue a friend and man the gun while he drives the truck to your home base, go to a location and kill the enemies, find collectibles and bring them to an NPC, etc etc. The standard fare as usual. Did you play Far Cry 3 or 4? This is like that, except set in Montana instead of a tropical island or Tibet.If you like Far Cry games, you're gonna like this. If you don't, you won't. Simple as.;1;30,6;23/06/2021;355;9

6;Action; 179,99;In a nutshell:Pros:1. Good graphics2. Surprises in the story at the end3. Game physics is good4. More involvement of Bosses in game (unlike Far Cry 4), which is good.5. Adds lot more contents in the game when compared to its predecessors.6. Availability of Guns for hire. OR form Your own squad with AI characters, which gets unlocked as the story progress.7. No more tower capture to unlock a region (although some elements of it exists here too)8. More detailed and realistic gun/vehicular battles.9. Support for Co-op in Story mode.10. Arcade mode for some extra game play.Cons:1. Even on pretty good configuration PC(GTX 1070 8GB), FPS drops to 30 sometimes, but not many instances. Probably because the game is tailored for AMD graphics.2. No option to change difficulty in middle of game story. Need to play out entire story in same difficulty level.3. Too much content in Game User Interface (UI) /Map which causes the UI to be cluttered.4. If You are someone who is moving up the far cry timeline and played FC3 and FC4 before this, You might take at least an hour of game play to understand the game features.5. In gun battles, hit reg not accurate sometimes.6. Co-op in story mode restricted to only 2 players in total (i.e. Yourself and one friend).7. If You invite Your friend to play in Co-op, only Your story proceeds/missions complete, and your friend's does not. Above Pros and Cons should be sufficient if You do not have time to read through the detailed review and need to decide if You want to buy this game or not. More detailed review below.P.S: Please play this game before playing Far Cry: New Dawn, to enjoy the new dawn instalment better.In Detailed Review:The Game:Unlike prior Far cry instalments, this game environment has more modern vibes to it. So, You'll have more modern weapons, and visiting a place on the map reveals it. No more tower climbing to remove cloaking.Basically, the map is a group of islands, ruled over by one main Boss (The Father) and 3 under bosses (His 2 brothers and 1 sister, well not biological though, haha). They together form a cult and make life hell for the natives. Its either join the cult or face Your maker, simple right?So, You play the role of a rookie deputy who will fight Your way to liberate the islands, and there is lots of story and elements to it on the way.The bosses:Each boss brings in their own flavour and elements to the story and game play, which is kind of good and makes missions less repetitive. The more outposts You liberate (not many, may be 4 to 5 outposts per boss) and more missions You complete (given by the natives), the more interest the local boss takes in You, taking you closer to defeat them.The Vehicles:A wide variety of Vehicles available, like trucks, vans, SUVs, boats etc along with the new addition of airplanes and helicopters, which can be used in free roam and missions.Guns for Hire:Basically 2 types:Type 1: CivilianEach civilian You rescue from the cults grasp during free roam can be used as a Gun for hire during next mission, until You release them. They ride with You, they can die for You, kill for You with guns blazing or with stealth. They can be found all over the map. No specialisations as such, good for regular gun fights.Type 2: Story AI CharactersThe other set of Guns for hire are the characters which are unlocked as You progress in main story. This set of Guns for hire are specialists and can be added to your squad. They can be called upon whenever You need them. There are 9 of these specialists which includes 3 animals and rest humans. The human specialists include a sniper, an airplane pilot, a helicopter pilot, a crossbow specialist (for stealth), a missile man etc. You can form a squad with them or call them in separately.Skills:Unlike prior instalments, skills in FC5 can be unlocked by finishing challenges. The challenges (which can be viewed in Map menu) needs to be completed to get reward points. These reward points can be used to unlock skills. Some challenges (for example) are get 10 kills with grenade, 8 kills with knife throw, 20 Melee kills, 5 road kills etc. So, higher the game difficulty, completing some challenges might get a bit difficult as game AI gets better.Skills are similar to FC3 and FC4, not many changes here. One difference I noticed is, no more crafting for weapon bag, loot bag, weapon holster etc by hunting animals for skins. This too needs reward points now. So make sure where You spend Your reward points well. Weapons:Anything and everything from a knife to arrow, pistol to assault and sniper rifles, from Grenade launchers to guided RPGs. If You have DLCs purchased too, You get martian weapons as well. You can carry upto 4 weapons at a time, provided You have unlocked the large weapon holster by using those reward points.Overall I would definitely recommend the game.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 7/10Attention to details: 6/10Thanks for reading the detailed review.

6;Action; 179,99;I've been a fan of Far Cry since the 3rd game, and was pretty excited for this one. I was not disappointed for the most part. As a fan of the series I have a lot to say about this game, so be preprared for a long read.PROS+ Looks amazing and is well optimized+ Soundtrack is great, including the radio songs+ Joseph Seed, the antagnoist, while not as good as Vaas or Pagan Min, is still good and really feels intimidating.+ Enemies actually have motivation and purpose, as opposed to the mindless pirates in FC3 or the braindead soldiers in FC4+NPCs have stuff to say now, they can tell you about locations, bases, hidden stashes, etc. Some even have conversations with each other that are fun to listen to, huge improvment from the old NPCs who were basically just there to be eaten by animals. The main NPCs are great and memorable too.+Lots more wildlife than the previous games, even have challenges to hunt them+Fishing is cool I guess, it's actually engaging and not an AFK activity like fishing in most games+ Planes and Helicopters are now in the game, and you can buy and customize vehicles instead of having to find them+ The bosses besides Joseph are more fleshed out and have their own methods and personalities.+ Companions are a new addition and are great, they never feel like a burden and can be instructed. Peaches is my personal favorite+ New resistance system is cool, you complete lots of varied activities in the world until you have enough points to face the regional boss and liberate the region.NEUTRAL~ I'm personally not a fan of the setting, I live in the U.S. so Montana isn't all that intersting to me, I'd much rather travel somehwere far away and exotic, however they do pull it off well, the atmosphere is great and I can see why people love it~ Co-op is an absolute blast however friends can't progress with you, you have to do each person's game twice~ Arcade is meh and most of the maps are player made and suck. Wish you could choose to only play Ubisoft mapsCONS- Hunting only yields you money, gone are the days of crafting upgrades, which is a huge shame, the old system was much more engaging.- Weapon variety is pretty bad, most weapons are just reskins of the same gun, even the unique weapons are identical to the standard versions, and they don't require anything to unlock, just more money, which is strange because the standard weapons are locked until you get enough resistance points, you can get the unique AKM before the standard one, it makes no sense at all.- Perks feel underwhelming compared to previous games.- Enemy planes and helicopters spawn way too often, feels more like a chore to kill them rather than and exciting battle.-No bladed melee weapons, I miss cutting people up with my machete/khukuri :(-Microtransactions for skins. Why was this necessary? It doesn't even cost much to unlock things with in-game money.Overall I think the game is good and definitely lives up to the Far Cry franchise, there are issues that bug me but they didn't ruin my experience. I think you'll enjoy this game, it's worth the full 60$, something that can be seldom said about games in this industry nowdays.;1;34,2;31/03/2018;847;28
6;Action; 179,99;The Patriot simulatorI'll start with the bottom line: All in all, its 'yet another far cry game', similar to how FC3, FC4 and to some extent FC Primal look and behave.* Story (with no spoilers) - You're playing as a deputy who tries to arrest a cult leader that has taken control of a county in Montana. This cult is made of religious extremists who believe the end is upon us and they must 'cull the herd' aka kill the weak to save the strong and be ready for 'the collapse' which is their modern version of the biblical flood i guess.Things go to sh*t when trying to arrest him and you and your group end up in a gang-war type of scenario which you must survive till you find shelter. From there, the game actually begins just like any other FarCry game begins - You're saved by an npc that instructs you on how to start managing yourself in the map's sorroundings.Been there, done that.* Map - Roughly on the same size as FC3/4/Primal in terms of total size, but is much more condensed and has a lot more things to do in it. The game overall feels more of a GTA V's free roam when it comes to side-events that you find while traversing it. You will find lots of friendlies and enemies driving around and packed action is basically everywhere.events like hostage rescue are very common, as well as helping out npc's on the road with their random problems.* Followers - The game has added npc follower mechanic which works pretty well. You can add upto 2 specific followers with you and they can level up as they kill enemies to gain buffs. Most of these npc's are scattered across the world map and each has their own buffs, so finding new npc's as followers is a game of roulette that will either reward or screw you in terms of how good the followers will be. You have a total of 9 special followers that are story-bound, and countless of scattered npc's that can be used as random followers, which you can only 'store' up to 3 on your followers list. You can command followers to move to certain spots, kill specific enemies, and even revive you if you're dying. Long press to make them follow you again. Each follower has its own command key so they can do different things if you order them different actions.* Guns - You can have upto 4 gun slots in your inventory (3 big weapons + 1 sidearm) + 1 slot for melee weapons + your own fists which you can use at anytime with your actual weapon (similar to Duke Nukem's kicks in the classic game Duke Nukem 3D). There are a few dozens of weapons in the game, ranging between melee weapons, pistols, smgs, rifles, snipers, and heavy guns like lmg's and rpg's.* Skill tree - Works a bit differently than previous FC games. Its a mashup of badass ranks from Borderlands 2 and previous FC titles. Instead of steady xp gain, you get skill points on certain actions that you do, like completing missions and finishing world objectives and achievements. You spend the skill points on perks just like previous FC titles. All the ammo/holster upgrades are managed through this skill tree, so theres no more benefit in hunting animals for these kind of upgrades. Animal hides can be sold for money but that's it.* AI - Enemy's AI seems to have a small improvement from earlier FC titles. They will take more time to detect you and their aim wont be as punishing as previous FC titles (tested on the hardest difficulty). Follower's AI can be wonky at times, but overall its tolerable.* Arcade mode - An added minigame that lets you play with and against other people in 6v6 matches or in co-op mode against AI enemies like zombies/aliens/humans. There is also a feature that lets you build your own levels and play other people's levels.* Uplay - The obvious elephant in the room - This game has some issues with Steam, even if you buy it directly from Steam, since it forces you to have Uplay installed and tells you to create a Uplay account for it anyway. From my experience, there are a few issues while playing this game that you should be aware of, though your milage may vary:1) When opening and then closing the steam overlay in mid game, there is a slight chance (of about 20%-30%) that the mouse will stop responding. This has been confirmed to only happen in this game so its not a mouse issue. If this happens to you, tab out of the game and tab back in to fix it.2) The more annoying issue: When pressing shift+f2 to bring up the Uplay interface (the equalevant of the Steam interface), there is a good chance the windows' mouse cursor will appear (and stay stuck) in the middle of the screen until you quit the game (will start happening after leaving uplay's interface and going back into the game). The only proper fix i've found for this is to restart the game. Sometimes, switching to 'borderless' mode instead of 'full screen' helps, but its not a guarantee.3) You cant rebind the tab button, which means that if pressing tab in mid game, it will always pause the game and switch to the map view. Sounds nice, but since you can't rebind it, you have to put up with constant game interruptions if you want to shift+tab to the Steam overlay while already in a game menu, as doing this will unpause your game in the process. In other words, you will have to be aware to not be in an in-game menu screen when tabbing into the steam overlay.Im fairly suspicious that these 3 issues are caused deliberatedly by Ubisoft to make Steam users avoid playing the game via the Steam interface and encourage them to migrate into Uplay entirely.* Performance - The game runs at an avg of 80 fps in high-ultra settings at 1440p with Radeon RX 5700XT GPU and Ryzen 5 2600x CPU. No big frame drops seemed to appear and its overall well optimized in my opinion.As for the DLC's...Lost on Mars - A 6-7 hours campaign that puts you on Mars with Hurk. This is a really nice DLC with incredible graphics and superb futuristic weapon designs. Lots of action packed and overall highly recommended.Hours of Darkness - A 3.5-4 hours campaign that puts you on a Vietnam rescue mission. This DLC is quite disappointing as the objectives are very generic with no real incentive to explore the map. Its also fairly easy with the weapons they give you from the beginning. No sense of progress and all in all it feels really rushed.Living Dead Zombies - A very short 1.5 hours gameplay that is split between 7 micro stories that Guy Marvel is trying to form about (yet another) zombie apocalypse. You play the role of the hero in each of these stories and basically he forms them while you traverse it from the world he's building around you, similar to Borderlands 2's DLC with Tiny Tina (but with zero character build up). The DLC shows how Guy Marvel is trying to pitch 7 ideas to different producers for them to build a movie from.This is the most disappointing DLC of the bunch as it offers by far the least amount of content and priced the same as the rest. Give it a hard pass.So, which FarCry 5 version should you buy?The basic one. Period. I've bought the Gold one as i thought the 3 DLC's will give me lots of extra hours to grind on each, but the reality was that only the Mars DLC was worth it, both in terms of length and gameplay/story. Some other things i've recieved were free cosmetics and a few extra weapons and cars that pretty much screamed 'pay to win', alongside some fancy cosmetics. Since in game money isn't a big issue in the game, i simply can't recommend buying the gold version for these extra gadgets as you can buy them later on from vendors anyway.So to sum it up: Buy the base game and the mars DLC individually, when they're on sale. Pass on the rest.In summary:As said in the beginning, when you boil it all up, its basically 'more FarCry', which comes with all the good and some of the bad of the previous titles. So if you loved playing the recent FarCry games, you will sure love this, but it doesn't seem to add anything that is new to the formula.;1;80,2;2/05/2020;192;5

6;Action; 179,99;Far Cry 5As a person who played through Far Cry 1 to Far Cry New Dawn I can say that this series had it's own falls and rises. And Far Cry 5 stays somewhere in the middle. Anyway, let's get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Cool partner system.+ Decent story. It was interesting at the start, boring in the middle and cool at the end.+ Stashes with cash are mostly interesting to solve.+ Clutch Nixon's challenges are really cool to do especially with a friend.+ Planes and Helicopters are really fun and good addition to the game.Cons:- There are some funny additional missions but most of them are boring.- Most of the additional and even main characters feel poorly written and not interesting.- It's mostly a game with the same mechanics and I don't mind it in some way but why remove good mechanics? For example, you don't need to hunt animals anymore because they only give you money for their skins and not an upgraded holster, etc like in previous parts.- If you play co-op your friend will not complete the story on their character which is some straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because my friend literally couldn't level up skills because the requirement is to kill a boss who we killed but it counts only for the host and he couldn't even buy guns because in his story he didn't reach a resistance level for it. I give this game a 6/10.Far Cry New DawnAnd I want to give a quick review of this game here as I didn't play it on Steam.Pros:+ Cool aesthetic design for everything. Map, animals, bikers, guns. Guns are especially cool.+ Really cool animations on silent kills. Made me wanna say "oof" for that poor guy who I stabbed in the eye.+ Story is a sequel of course. Simple and good I would say. + Sorties are especially cool and even unique to the series. Capturing a valuable bag and getting out in many different places is what I really enjoyed. Cons:- Partners are even cooler and funnier here but sometimes I don't get how they are so weak to instantly die from a lvl 1 biker.- Kinda short for its price.I give it a 7.5/10 but buy it on a sale.;1;25,9;24/06/2020;457;11
6;Action; 179,99;I'm giving this a good review because I liked it and plan to play through it again for giggles, but I'm going to start by saying I don't think everyone will enjoy this.  Here's why I liked it:1.  Shooting mechanics are pretty tight and intuitive.  I know that's really basic, but if it's off in a FPS that just kills it for me.2.  I love the premise.  This setting and the idea of this game just jives with me.  I'm fascinated by prepper culture and cults.  Riding around in a pickup truck shooting guns at a bunch of psychos with my redneck buddies is just my idea of a good time.3.  They actually tried really hard to give this game personality.  Thing is there's not a lot of acting in the game, it's not an RPG, but what's there is really solid.  They took great pains to make it really look like Montana.  You will hate the villains and you will like the good guys (Poor Jess!). they did a lot with very little.  Also the soundtrack of this game is freaking amazing, and it looks really good.4.  I'm a working adult, I like games I can play for 20 minutes and get something done.  I also like story driven FPS.  This works for me.Here's why I think other people wouldn't like it:1.  Very, very loose approach to the narrative.  If you are one of those people who loses interest in a show when the characters do something that doesn't strictly make logical sense, or you lose your mind when you encounter a plot hole, you're going to hate this.  If you can just kick back and say "it's just a game", or make up the reasons in your head why something happened, (i.e. you have a strong suspension of disbelief like I do) you'll be okay.  But a lot of things happen that just don't make any sense, if that bothers you, you won't like it.2.  The multiplayer aspects didn't thrill me, though I like the Arcade feature, that one's good, the rest... meh.3.  The bullet drop with sniper rifles drives some people crazy.4.  A friend of mine who tried this thought it was more like an RPG, and while it has a few light RPG style elements, it's not an RPG.

7;Action; 784,72;DISCLAIMER: I hate Ubisoft's open world games to an exponential degree and as such I had no interest in W_D2. However following the word of mouth, I got into the game a few weeks back. This review is for people who were burned by WD1 or just interested people in general  PROS: +Adapts a wider colour palette for San Francisco, ditching the depressing Greyish tone from WD1 altogether.+The option of completing the entire game non-lethally.+A casual, more light-hearted story that is self-aware and reflects upon the current Internet culture, with wacky characters.+Character customization is more diverse as opposed to the first game's preset clothing.+Radio towers, a plethora of collectibles and outposts have been removed altogether. +You have a lot more options with hacking. Call the SWAT on a NPC or place him on a gang's hitsquad. Cause a static vehicle to accelerate forward much to the surprise of the driver. This culminates in what people call Emergent Gameplay.+Online activities like Bounty hunter, Invasions and Co-op operations lend to longevity.+PC Version is also a significant step-up from first one. Favours numerous graphics options and a FOV slider. CONS: -Unsatisfying Gunplay. Customization of firearms is barebones.-Basic Stealth system. Cover mechanics is janky AF.-Braindead AI.-Vehicles controlling is more arcade-y. but improved from the first game.-Some rather bland mission designs. (Go to X, Hack Y, Watch a cutscene, Mission complete) VERDICT: Watch Dogs 2 came as a surprise to me. It got rid of a lot of stuff that Ubisoft is infamous for and opted for a better game world, the result is a far superior product than the previous title. It's not an absolute "OHMAGERD 10/10 GAYME HAS DOGES IN IT" that some people claim it to be but Ubisoft is making the right changes in its IPs, albeit little ones. If anyone is still on the fence after WD1, give this one a chance, you'll be fairly pleased.;1;57,0;28/05/2017;576;15

7;Action; 784,72;In the end, Watch Dogs 2 feels like an improvement over the previous game in the series. The characters are fun to play as and interact with, all of the hacking elements have a lot more depth and make more sense, and the world feels more alive and rich than ever before, design wise and graphics wise. However the game does suffer from mediocrity in regards to its shooting mechanics and stealth sections. Is it a fun game? Yeah, sure it is.⭐⭐⭐⭐✰;1;24687,1;30/12/2020;224;8

9;Action; 299,90;I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.  I found it was full of trolls.  Don't waste your time with Red Dead Online.;1;127,7;14/11/2021;741;8

I walked over and greeted him and he said "Who the hell you talking to?" then stood up and punched my hat right off of my head.We punched the hell out of each other and were both covered in blood. My health was nearly gone but then he ragdolled and faceplanted the table and a message popped up on screen saying something like "You can no longer use the barber".Turns out i just beat the crap out of the local barber.The sheriff came, i surrendered and spent the night in a cell. I had to pay $4.I went back to the saloon for another beer and a random guy walks up and talks about the fight i had the night before and how crazy it was.This is just one of many small immersive things which have happened so far outside of the main story.What a crazy game.;1;133,7;25/07/2022;732;115

9;Action; 299,90;I've played a lot of games for a long time this one is most impressive! And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law.;1;362,6;9/09/2021;847;11

Overwrite any files Done!Optional Steps for Optimal Experience4) Update SilentPatch.ini FPSLimit =60.*There are ~4 missions where 60fps breaks the game. To complete these you will need to set FPSLimit=30, beat the mission, and set it back to 60 again.5) Install Bully -Extended Draw Distance mod by Jessica Natalia on ModDB6) Install Bully -Anniversary Edition HUD by AuraShadow on ModDBTutorials can be found on Youtube but make sure to install SilentPatch AFTER installing & configuring widescreen fix.

11;Action; 99,50;Lucid, Organic, and Raw.feel free to watch this review in video form<<< click meMax Payne 3 and its presentation make it one of the greatest shooters I have ever played. Many other first and third-person shooters come off feeling stiff and artificial, no matter how esteemed the Game or Gameplay. There comes the point where we, as players grow conscious, realise that we are indeed controlling hardened tough guys, protagonists who may or may not let the odd grunt slip out of their inanimate lips upon taking damage. Max Payne 3 has made me realise that our Gordon Freeman's and Master Chiefs all lack emotion. visual and verbal feedback informing the player that they control a person, a living human being. Not a bunch of code that lets us sit on the shoulders of our favourite video game protagonists. Games lack moments that humanise the characters on the screen, Moments that, if included in a Game's design, Story, and Gameplay, would help grow the assemblage of 1 and 0s that the developers are trying to sell to us into real people. Max Payne 3 has these moments, and that is what makes it great. The Game's presentation and Gameplay are a trip - Lucid, Organic, and Raw. Playing the Game feels like a dream, literally. Everything feels so real, is so real. Max's fluid animations blend seamlessly into one another, dynamically reacting to player input, making the Game feel authentic and visceral. I find it astonishing how gunplay remains smooth and intuitive despite being so heavily animated -  the shooting mechanics are some of the best I've seen to date. it's just so satisfying. Shooting someone isn't something that just happens - it's impactful. You won't see enemies merely rag-doll after being shot. they react to their injuries, clutching their wounds, squeezing their eyes shut with pursed lips. every death feels unique, with a weight that is felt. A life that Max and I have taken. Perhaps that's just the Game's masterful presentation talking as it imprints on my mind, adding depth and subtle details that may not be there at all. Admittedly levels feel claustrophobic, and the Game itself is exceptionally linear, with many areas and battle arenas feeling limited. It would've been nice to see more areas like the Nightclub and the Airport that offer more room to move around. however, the levels have benefited from this design choice and are extraordinarily detailed with incredible fidelity. That aside, Max is a man in pain. I got that much. However, you don't just see his pain in cut-scenes, but throughout the Gameplay. Many Games fail to convey how the protagonist feels during the most crucial part of any Game. the Gameplay. They abandon the emotion. it's only allowed for cut-scenes and dialogue, right? Wrong.Max doesn't walk. He pulls himself around, dragging his clunky feet, always moving nonchalantly - even when he leaps into the air, there's no grace to be seen. Max ends up falling to the floor like a pile of bricks - struggling, as he staggers back onto his feet. The youthful nature seen in previous instalments made you feel like Neo from the Matrix. Now, It's all gone.Max's movements. they're unhurried. he's tired, he's in pain. Max is now the one looking to buy more sand for his hourglass, or perhaps he's waiting for it to run out? He's hanging heavy, desperately hauling himself from altercation to altercation - shootout to shootout. Through his animations and mannerisms, you see all of this during Gameplay - the feeling of pain, a man whose entire being has shattered into billions of pieces. He's lost everything, and you don't just see this during a cut scene of Max drowning his soul in liquor. that depressing, painful tone is slathered all over the Game. That tone is why Max Payne 3 is my favourite out of the entire trilogy. Max Payne 3 has been one of the best gaming experiences I've had in some time. It's a Game I see myself replaying for its visceral nature, fluid animations and gunplay. Like many others, this Game is a sublime work of art—the story and storytelling - Max's character progression. Sadly, we won't see a Max Payne 4. it's a shame as I have not felt as invested in a character for a long time. James McCaffreys went above and beyond bringing this character to life. And goodness, the music - Health made sure this Game had a soundtrack I won't be forgetting anytime soon. As mentioned before, Lucid, Organic, and Raw are the three words I would use to describe this Game. It's engaging and surprisingly intimate. unequivocally one of the Best Games I've ever played.Rest easy, Max. Thank You,removedmaterial;1;15,0;28/12/2020;192;5

13;Adventure;00,00;This game is great but ITS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE I mean come on! It's 6 years old!Why does the game cost 40 dollars, and every DLC costs the same? The game doesn't feel complete without owning at least 5 DLC packs, but I don't have 482 dollars to throw away at some game from 2014! It's so hard to decide what to buy because there are so many packs that go together, some that aren't complete without another, and some that just have a couple Itmes I really want but is too expensive;1;455,5;4/11/2020;1864;80

14;Action; 229,00;I have been playing BF games since back in 2003, when you had to go and buy them from the game shop down the town center. They came on a CD/DVD. BF2 & Special Forces were fantastic games.I bought this game about 1 month or so ago now, was really looking forward to it, until I played in a match with more hackers than there were normal players!!!!Every single game on a DICE server has a hacker or 2 or more on it!! You go to the EA forums and post about it and they advise to use the in-game reporting method - so you do that, and yet, after 1 month, the same hackers are STILL PLAYING the game. So you go back to the forum, post about it again, and EA shut down your post and mark their spam post as the solution to your post, even though they haven't answered anything properly - They then tell you they do not allow posts about anti-cheats or cheating on teh AHQ FOrum - Really? Is that because you know you are useless at stopping it EA??It's for this reason alone I give this game a thumbs down, if it wasn't for all the hackers and EA's lack of care about getting ird of them it would be a good game!;0;587,4;4/08/2021;2192;72
14;Action; 229,00;Plagued by hackers, almost no oceania community, devs don't care, hackers are so well known that players recognize them by name but they still haven't been banned. Lazy.Edit: Wow this review got a lot more publicity than I expected! That being said, now that I've played a bit more I'd like to revise my initial thoughts. Battlefield V has the hallmarks of a good game, the bullet ballistics are good, team work and strategy is good, the graphics and cool WW2 weaponry are good. But all this is over-arched by critical flaws that I'm guessing were the result of EA deciding this game wasn't likely to be as profitable as they were expecting. Customization feels lacking at best with a lot of cosmetic items being really boring or really expensive to encourage the use of in game currency. Weapon customization has similar problems with only a few "specializations" for each weapon, mostly making it magically have less recoil or reload faster among other uncreative things. The most critical flaw this game suffers is the complete abandonment by the developers. They obviously knew their time wouldn't make them money and decided to leave the game in a state that feels late beta at best. There's a lot of controversy in the comments about me saying the game is plagued by hackers but I stand by this statement. It's been abandoned, players don't get banned, reports don't get answered. If you want to play the game despite these flaws because you like WW2 or the Battlefield series, there's definetly fun to be had but heres a few tips:* Avoid official servers: that's right, the official servers receive seemingly 0 maintenance and manually administrated servers are massively more effective at banning hackers than the official servers. EA you should be ashamed.* Consider avoiding if you live in a remote area: In Australia today I was able to find just 1 conquest server with 40 players and able to at least play the game (10AM on a Wednesday). I really can't guarantee that there will be any player base if you live somewhere more exotic than Australia, USA and Europe are probably okay. Don't count on being able to find a server if you're a night owl like me.Overall this game had a lot of potential but it stands as a hollow shell of what it could have been. I liked the inclusion of female characters and being able to play as someone who I felt more of a connection to but the amount of hostility EA showed towards their player base was uncalled for and instead of making up for it they took the money and ran.;0;54,0;29/06/2020;1113;55

15;Action; 199,00;Sum up+ Level design with proper amounts of exploration.+ Lightsaber combat is both fun and a spectacle to the eyes.+ Beautiful graphics that capture the atmosphere of Star Wars.+ Multiple paths to reach an objective, giving room to freedom and exciting turns in platforming.+ The soundtrack further elevates the game. it always fit the situations and manages to convey emotions of the case.+ Enemies and bosses are entertaining, from dealing with a more significant number of stormtroopers to facing Sith lords in intense duels.- Some technical problems in terms of glitches and optimization.-Specific skills are poorly balanced, such as "best friends," which gives force meter each time a stim is activated.- The story is excellent, but it lacks those critical moments in the beginning and the ending. Could have used more content to flesh the origin of Cal Kestis and his journey entirely. Introduction Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. It follows the story of Cal Kestis, a Jedi who survived order 66 by hiding in a planet as a scrap worker. It features elements from multiples sub-genres in the action category and incorporates them to elevate its gameplay further. From lightsaber combat to climbing and soul-likes bosses, the game grabs a bit from each of the best titles but not to the point those mechanics would obscure its own identity. Gameplay The combat is simple but also is a lot of fun. It has vast layers put into it that can appear rather lackluster at first. Still, they are intelligent choices from the developer. Cal Kestis has access to his lightsaber for physical combat and the force to open his options. Lightsaber techniques can range from throwing it towards enemies before it comes back. Different combos or forms, while the force can range from pushing back grenades towards enemies, force pulling, slowing enemies, and more.Players have a ton of options when facing the stormtroopers. You can push them off cliffs, throw them into one another, reflect beams at them, or cut them down with parries, to name just a few. It gives the player freedom to how they will approach any encounter with them or try new ideas. Hurl something at them, put them in front of their own blaster, forcing them towards you. The game has a lot of  possibilities.The platforming aspect of the game is also again, a successful decision in design. There are multiple ways to reach an objective on the map. For example, you can get to the next goal, die, take another path, and achieve that same destination. What is great about this is that those paths are very different when it comes to traveling itself and that they reward exploration. You can visit areas in the order you want, even as far as to go to planets you are not prepared for or discover secret places to visit later.It borrows aspects from games like Zelda, Metroid, Uncharted, Dark Souls. It then incorporates Cal Kestis mechanics into them to make them unique to the game. Puzzles and exploration being limited until you unlock new abilities, platforming that involves using the force to expand one's reach. Approach to level design, and finally combat that mixes dodging, parrying, smart use of the force and lightsaber combat.It is rewarding to be able to visit prior planets and discover that now you can take that path that was blocked before. Enemies being added in locations and exploring side stuff such as collectibles or hidden ways. Enemies have a defense meter, like a shield of sorts and until the player doesn't deplete that they won't be able to damage them. The combat is focused on reaction to how the player reacts to the enemy's attacks and groups of them. All of them have unblockable attacks, and bosses are ferocious with brutal powers and agile movements. Strong points The strong points are its story, that while it has some flaws, it is an enjoyable journey and manages to captivate what makes Star Wars so great as a franchise. The gameplay doesn't get boring because of new enemies showing up from time to time, keeping it fresh, along with the variety of options the player has. Bosses are exciting, particularly the last ones are hard to beat, and they give intense duels.The integration of elements from other games is a concept that I like. Bringing a more refined quality in gameplay but also being careful not to let those elements get to carried away and making the game into a copy of those other games. Finally, customization while the ponchos and ship can be some recolors. the lightsabers have a lot of customization into them. All colors are present except for red. you can change the hilt. The material, the handle, just about everything about them, and let's be honest lightsabers are very cool. It allows one to personalize the aesthetics of Cal Kestis to suit their particular tastes. Story The plot revolves around Cal Kestis, a young man who works to earn his living on a planet controlled by the empire. The plot follows up after the purge of the Jedi after order 66, and Kestis being a Jedi padawan, spends most of his days in hiding. One day, however, he is discovered by the empire. After escaping certain death, he ends up meeting Cere Junda, a former Jedi who managed to escape the Purge of Order 66 and the pilot Greez Ditus, the Mantis ship's owner.Without spoiling too much, the story is good, but both the beginning and the ending of it lack specific amounts of flesh. The start of the game is sprung while the end is abrupt. However, the rest of it is rich in detail, with information on the planets that you visit, references to famous characters and events. Good pacing that allows for character development and for the player to get to know these characters.The exploration of planets adds layers to the lore game, especially if you already heard of them before. The story has the premises of a Star Wars film. Comedic moments that can give a laugh or darker ones that can emanate conflicting thoughts or uncertainty of how things will play out. It is fantastic and one of the best aspects of the game. Some Notes The games run faulty on a GTX 1060. it runs okay in a GTX 1070 and anything above that it runs flawlessly. I could notice that in 1060, there were a lot of frame drops, so I would not recommend it for GTX 1060 users unless you don't mind playing in 30 FPS, which is less than ideal. There are also some bugs such as getting stuck in a wall or BD never turning off the scanner light, but those were few, rare instances.UPDATE: So users report the game doing well on a GTX 1060, while others said it has lots of frame drops. In our experience, the game did not run well on a 1060 but it did on a 1070. If you have a 1060, you will have to try it yourself to see if it runs well or not. Conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is probably one of the best games released in 2019. While the game doesn't manage to make something revolutionary or unique, it certainly knows how to add other elements and taking them into what Star Wars means. The combat, while simple, has a lot of freedom build into it, and the platforming-backtracking is excellent. Whenever you are a Star Wars fan or not, this is a game that you should consider getting.If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/;1;13,1;26/11/2019;954;49
15;Action; 199,00;Jedi Fallen Order is, by quite a big margin, the most surprising title of the year for me, not only compared to the expectations I had for it, which were admittedly pretty low, but for how genuinely brilliant this game achieves to be.It's true, Fallen Order really looks like a greatest hits of all the major and most appreciated mechanics we've seen in single player videogames in the last few years: we have bombastic cinematic moments took straight from the Uncharted series (if you played Uncharted 2, you'll probably find the first hour of the game to be hilarious, in that sense), tombs with puzzles to solve and walls to jump onto that seem borrowed from the rebooted Tomb Raider trilogy, a combat system very similar to what we recently saw in Sekiro by From Software but, thankfully, they never end up falling in the "been there, done that" zone and they always feel extremely polished and cohesively combined, returning us a fantastic experience that is far more than the sum of its parts. The level design by Respawn is also top notch, with an intricate map design that is both a joy to explore in every corner the first time, in order to find secrets and hidden optional enemies, and fun to return to once you unlocked those abilities you were missing and that you can now use to reach places you couldn't get to before. The difficulty is well balanced and, at the hardest setting, it gives you a nice challenge without resulting too frustrating: this is definitely the difficulty to pick if you're experienced with action games like Sekiro. The story is coherent and serviceable, enriched by a cast of interesting characters you'll most likely want to know more about (sadly our main guy isn't one of them, that is the one thing that never changed from my initial impressions). On the technical side the game is also very solid, with great graphics and an extremely polished PC port. the only issues I encountered during my playthrough were all due to the integration with Origin, which is something they really can't drop soon enough. All things considered, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a brilliant game that everyone should at least consider playing, even if they're not particularly interested in the Star Wars universe (I'm not a massive fan of the saga myself). Great job, Respawn!;1;25,9;6/12/2019;479;28
15;Action; 199,00;I am so proud of Respawn Entertainment.I don't want to discredit them whatsoever, when I say that I was worried EA would step on their toes and sabotage this game in order to prove the narrative of 'people don't want singleplayer games'Yet against all odds, they made such an amazingly wonderful experience that feels like a true, real game.This company is proof that there's life in EA, Filled with people who care if they would just be left alone to create experiences. I FEEL like a Jedi... not infinitely powerful, but, one who's vulnerable, scared, and learning to survive and thrive. I feel empowered. I feel rewarded. I feel like Luke... but I am Cal. And being Cal is a wonderful, beautiful experience, from the graphics to the music to the subtle world-building....

I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the "Witcher 3 TV show". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.Thank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don't know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never.;1;105,6;1/12/2022;1524;29
17;RPG; 199,90;Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been "playable" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the "next gen" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.The game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. There is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.I really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.;1;145,7;16/02/2022;5241;86

17;RPG; 199,90;For me this is the end of the Night City story. I completed all the tasks, unlocked all the endings and completed the DLC. Honestly, I actually cried a lot in this game. haha. It was also fun, such a contrast in the game allowed us to move on, gave us hope for something good. But I can say that Cyberpunk 2077 will never end well. You have to make hard choices, but in the end you will still lose something.I fell in love with this game and would like to forget everything that happened in it, so that I could plunge into Night City again like the first time.;1;170,9;19/11/2023;1278;18
17;RPG; 199,90;Patch 1.5 fixed everything for me. The quests make more sense. The fixers make more sense. The map and mini map make more sense.The driving is a lot more fun. Throwing knives and a katana were something I never knew I needed. The city feels a little bit more alive. The voice acting was always great, but now the npc facial expressions flow more with the dialogue. Like, Judy actually rolled her eyes at me in a believable way. Played for hours without having to reload or crash because of a glitch. It's all I want to play. It cured (replaced) my Skyrim addiction.;1;186,2;19/02/2022;1805;79

17;RPG; 199,90;Watches Edgerunners -> Downloads Cyberpunk 2077-> has the time of his life;1;98,6;30/10/2022;2355;138
17;RPG; 199,90;I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. 2 years later... I'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch. I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. 1 day later...I can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. "It looks decent and actually pretty fun now," I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.2 days later...I see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam. just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. Present day... This game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!Some thoughts:This game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. P.S.Also watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.;1;73,0;28/09/2022;616;10

18;RPG; 59,99;Here's the truth:- CD Projekt Red announces Cyberpunk 2077. - I never played any of the Witcher games till then.- "Oh no gotta play Witcher 3 everyone's crazy about it"- But I like a good story, can't skip Witcher 1 and 2.- Play Witcher 1 - 40+ hours - dammit.- Play Witcher 2 - 30+ hours and not really an open world but still an amazing story and totally into the characters - dammit.- Play Witcher 3 - 50+ hours and not even finished 20% of the game - dammit.I promise you though, when you are old and dying and look back on your life and wonder where did I waste my time, this will not be one of them. Totally worth it.;1;32,8;5/11/2018;1388;148
18;RPG; 59,99;At first I was a bit hesitant to play this game because I don't typically like fantasy RPG themed games.  I do like games that have deep and mature narratives.  I also like games with complex combat mechanics.  I heard that this game was very good at these things, so I decided to give it a try.The story is  very good.  It is also very complex so it is important to pay attention to the dialog.  Player choices definitely have an impact on the game world and many choices are morally ambiguous which tie-in well to the mature theme of the story.  What impressed me the most was how much impact player choice dynamically altered the game world and the direction of the story.  The game has 8 different endings based on the player's decisions.  This is also the only game that I have ever played that completely alters the main quest line depending on these choices.  This means that you will not see every main story quest, characters and locations unless you play the game through multiple times.  Many games that change the world based on choices usually do so using trickery that gives you the "illusion" of choice.  The developers of this game actually took the time to create all of the extra story content instead of using tricks and this gives the Witcher 2 a ton of replayability.The combat system in this game is also very deep and challenging.  You will carry a steel sword to take care of humanoid opponents and you will carry a silver sword to deal with monsters.  Knowing when to switch is important to dealing proper damage to your target.  Combat also requires proper preparation so the player will need to know how and when to use magical signs, place traps, drink potions, oil swords and use bombs and other Witcher tricks to get the job done.  Simply wading into the combat only slashing away with a sword will often times get you killed.  Combat can take some time to get used to and is definitely a refreshing departure from simply auto targeting and mashing a single button.Visuals are very impressive and it is very apparent that the developers took a lot of time in creating the environments for the game.  Music is outstanding and the score sets the tone appropriately.One of the few downsides that I can think of is the disparity of the difficulty levels.  Normal difficulty can be daunting with the complex combat mechanics and is a bit harder than the normal difficulty level of similar games.  Easy is a nod to RPG beginners, but is so easy that you can ignore most of the combat mechanics and simply survive every encounter by using only the swords.  The only other downside that I had with the game was related to map design.  I found navigation on some of the maps to be overly complicated and I spent a lot of time simply wandering about trying to find a way to get to certain points on the map.  Other than these two small quibbles I found the game design to be very solid and entertaining.Lots of content in this game.  My playthrough took about 40 hours doing most of the side activities, and I mostly took my time without rushing things.  Additional playthroughs would be required to see the other 7 endings and to play the other story paths leading up to those endings.  You can easily get hundreds of hours out of this game if you wanted to explore all of these options so lots of replay value as I mentioned earlier.I highly recommend this game.  I understand that the Witcher 3 is supposed to expand to a much more open world environment and have even more non-linear story options.  After playing Witcher 2 I am looking forward to playing the upcoming sequel when it comes out.;1;50,4;26/01/2014;909;2
18;RPG; 59,99;Warning before buying this game TOO MUCH PLOT.Do you like games with main stories with perfect, detailed, explanation?Do you wanna rush main quests like maniac, to learn what's next?Do you like multiple characters in main quest with their own stories and desires?Do you wanna know who's behind everything?Do you like to get the ability of choosing your character's fate?Are you a hardcore gamer? (Play this on the Insane Difficulty)Do you have bad pc?Then this game is for you!It's really unmissable when on sale it only costs 3$..;1;112,1;31/05/2017;575;59
18;RPG; 59,99;First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on. This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books by Andrzej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.;1;141,8;26/11/2013;909;2
18;RPG; 59,99;Having played all three Witcher games, you should buy all of them except for one. Then buy the books. Then be depressed because you've exhausted all of the content in the Witcher universe. Then go back to Witcher one and play it anyway because you love Geralt but hate yourself.;1;27,9;7/12/2021;587;252
18;RPG; 59,99;As a major improvement from the first title(the first is still a fantastic game, don't get me wrong), The Witcher 2 marks a milestone not only for CD Projekt RED, but a landmark for which other games fall short of.  Too often a game preaches where choices matter and regardless of what you choose the outcome is the same.  This title puts you back in the hands of Geralt of Rivia. however, this time, the consequences of your actions merit even greater twists and deeper turns.  Not only changing the NPC's outlook on you. instead, you may find yourself in a completely different area of the game had you chosen your actions otherwise.  To stack on the improvements, this game features a much smoother combat system and graphical enhancements so beautiful, you will need a new F12 key (screenshot) by the time you finish this story once.  As an avid explorer of games, one play through of this game granted roughly 50 hours of play time on Hard difficulty.  With bigger titles for $60 giving a mere 10 hours of game play, at $20 this instalment is a steal already, let alone when it is discounted.  If you enjoyed the first game, or even if you hated the first game and couldn't get over the combat, this should make its way to your library.;1;55,5;2/11/2014;272;5
18;RPG; 59,99;Witcher 2 is my favorite game. It is a solid RPG with a lot of action and a brilliant story. It is very mature in a lot of its themes and situations. This game is based on novels written by a Polish authornamed  Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a Witcher, or a genetically enhanced monster hunter. They have been described as a kind of warrior monk. Geralt drinks special potions that let him far exceed the abilities of normal humans. These potions are needed to battle the various beasts of the realms. Witchers also have a very limited understanding of magical energy called Witcher's Signs. Basically the Signs are spells, like a fireball and a paralysis trap spell and a few others. Geralt is an interesting character because he is not quite human but hes not a monster either. Due to their methods and abilities, however, many in the world see Witchers as freaks and monsters. Which is really what the game's ideology is all about. the greyness in everyone, not the clear cut black and white. Which to me, is a welcome change from the usual: 1) "hey I'm a good guy I will help you"  2) "Not my problem Kachinsky" 3) F*** YOU F*** FACE," that many other game are notorious for.  Geralt is often put in positions of just making a choice, not good or evil, just difficult decisions that have a lot of positives and negatives to them. The story is top notch, and eerily real in many of the stuggles of the world. Geralt has a set of skill trees (sword, magic, alchemy) that the player can advance in any way. All into one or spliced between the three. Sword fighting is a core mechanic though, so no matter how you play, Geralt will always have two swords. A silver sword for monsters, and a normal sword for humans. There are a few other weapons too but mostly its swords. Depending on the player preference combat can be a bit like the Batman games, or the Assassins Creed games. In some ways it can be like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Weapons and armor play a big part as well and can effect all of the skill trees. Making the game very balanced between gear and character tree choices. Not to the crazy levels of a Diablo game but enough to make for a very quality rpg.Mostly though, Witcher 2 is a lot like skyrim. I do not want to bash on skyrim here, it is also a great game that a lot of people absolutely love. I feel, however, that Witcher is far better than skyrim and think the people that love skyrim should try the Witcher. Both games have the northern lore and feel. Witcher 2 is no where near as large or open as skyrim. Witcher is much more linear but the story and combat and the world just feel so much better in every way to me. The enemies and the different races were better portrayed during the game. When I came to a new town in skyrim I did not get that feeling of truly new. Just another town and another barbarian guy leading it. Witcher was totally different, you get the feeling of racial tensions and social tensions in every part. The powers that be are very different and each very developed and very human. As it plays out you really see how the choices alter the world, instead of it coming down to "OK I'm a good guy so I will save good guy town." A lot of games try to get that feeling across of the characters true M.O. and demeanor but fail. Witcher acomplishes this very well. Triple AAA quality. Superb graphics, superb voice acting. I enjoyed every character. There were a few times, of course, where some tones were a bit off but that happens in every game. Overall amazing game. When I learned that this game was made by a small studio in Poland I was shocked.As someone who never read any of the books and did not play the first game, I found that after a second playthrough the story and everyhting started to click and I realised how well done everything really was. The way the game is, one would want to play it at least twice to see both sides of what is going on.It seems as though more than a few people found the game to be really difficult. It can be, but now there are plenty of guides and discussions about it. The game has a kind of reverse curve for the difficulty. It is much harder in the beginning due to a lack of points in the skill tree and low grade weapons and armor. By the end though, Geralt is pretty much on par with jezuz. I like games of this nature, because being really stong at the end makes it feel like you really acomplished something. This game also has subtitles in many languages so I found it made a great gift for steam friends who are not natural to the english language.I would reccommend this game to anyone. Especially anyone who likes Skyrim, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Chivalry, Darksouls, Lord of the Rings or any games like them.;1;361,1;30/12/2014;229;5
18;RPG; 59,99;Before I start this review, I want to everyone to know that I played this game in January 2022 more than a decade after its release & mind you I have done 2 full playthroughs of the its Sequel the Witcher 3. I shall try my best to be unbiased and avoid any kind of fanboyism. Also, will NOT compare it to the latest gen games released in the previous 8 to 10 years. TL . DR  Watch the Video Review Instead with the link below  The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings REVIEW A decade ago back in 2010 & 2011the AAA games of the RPG category were 2010: i) Red Dead Redemption ii) Assassin's Creed: Brotherhoodiii) God of War 3 2011: i) Batman Arkham Cityii) The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrimiii) Darks Soulsiv) Uncharted 3v) Assassin's Creed: Revelations Introduction: Now let’s come to the actual review it leaves me utterly shocked that The Witcher 2 had to compete with such a list of legendary games of their time back in 2010-2011, each one of the games mentioned above were major hits, minus one or two.Being a crazy Witcher 3 fan in the back of my mind I kept on comparing it with its sequel obviously which is unfair, I kept on telling myself NO just NO, but the more I played the more I wanted to play it further.  Story: The story of Witcher world is without any doubt one the best fantasy stories written from its lore to its smallest character. The same is the case of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. It seems as if you are actually living the journey and believe me playing its sequel beforehand numerous times, it makes so much sense. It's mind blowing, almost like huge blanks of the Witcher 3 story are getting filled in your brain, From the origins of The Wild Hunt to the rarity and dying professions of Witchers. Then something which boggles your mind in TW2, is the two extreme sides of Witchers, one being Geralt a chivalrous Witcher who is all for good deeds and as he claims choosing the lesser evil, then we have Letho, Auckes & Serrit ex Witchers from the School of Viper who have become assassins &  puppets of the power players of the Continent i.e. Kings & Mages etc.I would give the story a solid 10 of 10. Gameplay: When it comes to gameplay mechanics in the beginning repeatedly I would keep on telling myself again and again, stop comparing it with The Witcher 3 and the newer RPG games which came after it. The gameplay to my surprise was quite good actually, you get used to Geralt kind of playing dance with his sword and whirling. The way Geralt ran / Walked it seemed a tad bit unrealistic, the Witcher signs and how they worked seemed even better than TW3. The monster attacks were almost at par to that of the TW3 I would say way less annoying. I like the random TW2 monsters they're way less aggressive and deadly, especially the Drowners. It's kind of a let-down how Geralt doesn't jump, which RPG games of 2010 & 2011 RPG characters did jump, also I missed not having roach and no fast travelling, which meant a lot time was spent just walking but at the same time it is not a full open world game like the countless games which came after it. A flaw which used to frustrate me was that Geralt would use the wrong sword and you had to switch to your other sword mid fight / combat.I would give the gameplay 7.5 out of 10 Interface: The interface of TW2 is probably the worst things about this game, don't even get me started how badly the map sucked. You literally had to zoom in and then it would be of no use would leave the player further confused and the legends / markers on the map made no sense what so ever. When it came to Alchemy, brewing & drinking potions it was not as easy as it should have been. Now let’s talk of the loot and crafting items. There was loot with you which made no sense what so ever as they were quests items which you needlessly held on even though that quest line was over ages ago. Thankfully crafting your gear was quite easy and not that complicated.  The journal was quite simple and easy to navigate, to figure out your Quests and other important stuff.I would give the interface a 4 out of 10 Optimization: When it comes Optimization it's not just the stability it’s the entire graphical as well the technical aspect which I could understand or think off. My opinion is games and their stability / optimization should only be given a judgment upon on their initial release like a month or two Max, which is pointless after a decade. I have an i9 9900k, RTX 3070Ti & 32GB Ram, I play all my games at native 4K with G - Sync on. The game worked perfectly but in certain situations it felt as if it had a clash going on with my multiple monitor setup, then it has a bug in which after the end of chapter 1 the game gets stuck on the loading screen, it only gets resolved when you play that same quest on the windowed mode, then it never occurs again. Talking about the graphics they're really good for 2011. I am not going to dwell on the fact what I didn't like about the graphics as it's irrelevant my assumptions are totally based on my minds comparison with latest games. I would end by talking about the sound a bit, the Background music was truly artistic and never went out of synchronization with the visuals. A job well done by the creative and sound team.I would give the Optimization 7 out of 10 Conclusion: I would recommend this game to every RPG player especially if they looking for both a storyline and gameplay. Mind you, if you play this then you have to play TW3 which is something else entirely. The TW3 players who haven't played TW2 you have to try it out but mind you, tune your mind and please think you live in 2011 otherwise you will compare it with newer games and would fail to enjoy. I am definitely going to go for another TW3 playthrough.I am going to give the The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings a total of 7 / 10. I wish I could give it more but there are certain things which can't be ignored.;1;58,7;30/01/2022;243;5
18;RPG; 59,99;Originally released in 2011, The Witcher 2 flew under the radar for a lot of people and was overshadowed by the ever-popular Skyrim. While not as well known, The Witcher 2 offers a much stronger narrative along with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and varied areas.You once again play as the Witcher. Geralt, who finds himself protecting King Foltest of Temaria after an assassination attempt. Ultimately, the second attempt succeeds and Geralt is framed for the murder. After escaping from a Temarian dungeon, Geralt decides to track down the real kingslayer in order to clear his name while trying to piece together his fragmented memory.The game is separated into three chapters each with their own main area along with a handful of side-quests. These areas are structured and paced well, allowing room for exploration without straying too far from the main storyline. The decisions you make along the way directly influence the narrative and can have a dramatic effect on the rest of the game. For example. decisions made in the first chapter can completely change the second, allowing plenty of room for re-playability. The game also features multiple endings, which vary based on your choices.The choices are morally ambiguous. there is no clear right or wrong answer in most cases. It’s more about choosing a side and watching the events unfold. While the first Witcher game focused more on slaying monsters, Geralt is trapped in the middle of political turmoil in this installment. These elements of the story add an additional level of complexity and immersion as the game feels almost similar to a season of Game of Thrones. Playing the first game is by no means necessary to enjoying The Witcher 2 as it provides plenty of backstory as well as a solid and cohesive narrative.The combat is solid as the game will have you balance between swordplay, magic, as well as parrying and dodging. The use of traps can also add an additional level of strategy and planning to most encounters. There is also the inclusion of alchemy, allowing Geralt to drink various potions each with different passive bonuses as well as negative side effects. The potions are generally used on a trial and error basis though, since Geralt isn’t able to use them during combat. The game does provide a reasonable challenge, especially on the harder difficulties, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other titles released these days.Orens, the main currency in the game is rather scarce, placing a large emphasis on crafting. The crafting system is solid and will have you hoarding as many resources as possible in order to create various armor, traps, weapons, and upgrades.CD Projekt Red is a company that really loves their fans. While other developers release paid DLC, CDPR released an Enhanced Edition at no additional cost which added multiple cut-scenes, quests, and additional polish. The soundtrack is fantastic, as it really adds an epic feel to the game. The voice acting for the main characters is top-notch while some of the acting for the additional characters is re-used but that is to be expected considering the overall length of the game.The graphics are absolutely stunning, as the environments are extremely detailed and varied. The character models and armor look great, although the facial animations can be a bit stiff and lifeless at times. You really have to look hard for low-res textures as even the smallest objects are carefully rendered.Overall, The Witcher 2 is a game that should be played by anyone that is a fan of the genre. It features benchmark graphics, a top-shelf narrative, and offers plenty of content along with elements of re-playability.For a much more detailed and thorough review, here’s a video I edited together for my friend Trent:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEPbEpWHMeoThe Witcher 2 also made our list for the greatest games released over the past 8 years.

18;RPG; 59,99;After finishing Witcher 3, I decided to play the series from the start so I played The Witcher 1 & it was great Experiance. However the Witcher 2 is much better! The Combat system is much much better than Witcher 1 .Story : 9 / 10Graphics : 9/10music : 9/10Gameplay: 9/109/10. Recommended.;1;24,7;14/06/2017;358;13
19;Action; 16,99;I got this game on a sale for 1.49 EUR and it was the best deal ever, it turned out to be amazing. It's not for everyone however, as it's quite long, you need to pay attention to the story and get used to the clunky combat - you'll either love it or give up in the first few hours.I started the game to see what it's like, struggled with the fighting, played half an hour until it suddenly crashed and I realised I didn't save the game. I didn't really like what I saw first, but I decided to give it another chance. Fortunately, the dialogues are skippable, so I could continue almost immediately and this time I read the tutorial more attentively and managed to find out how to properly kill enemies. As the story progressed, I got more and more into it and started to enjoy the game very much.GraphicsEven though the game came out in 2007, it's beautiful. The environments are detailed, colourful and interesting, most places are not just visually but aesthetically pleasing. Heck, even some dark crypts and caves look exquisite here and there due to the nice colours and great lighting.GameplayWhen you start the game, you have to choose a style you want to play it in, and you still have the opportunity to change this anytime. You can have an isometric camera or OTS, so you can play point and click style, and also in third person if you want to (I chose the latter). Being inexperienced with RPGs, I played on easy. My character became pretty strong eventually (maybe too strong for this difficulty), yet there still were a few challenging parts to balance that out.As you play, you gain XP and level up. While meditating, you can access the skill tree, which looked a bit complicated at first, but it makes perfect sense. Alchemy is pretty useful, especially for bigger fights, I haven't used any bombs though.The gameplay is not particularly interesting on its own, the story is what makes it special. Sometimes there's a lot of running back and forth, collecting things, which gets boring after a while. I was very grateful for the few fast travel options we got.On the other hand, there are lots of side quests to keep you busy. Some of them are of the general collect-this-and-I-reward-you tpye, and there are more important ones as well. Some side quests enrich the story a lot and have an overall impact on how you experience it, so it's definitely worth completing those.CombatIt's doubtless that this is the low point of the game. The first time I saw Geralt grabbing a sword and swinging it around above his head like an idiot, I laughed out loud, I thought it was a bug. (Later though as I applied more talents on the swords, he became a much better fighter.) To evade attacks you need to dodge by pressing one of the direction buttons twice or more times, depending on how responsive it wants to be in the current situation, I had some trouble sometimes when Geralt got cornered. To attack, you need to click on the enemy and do not click again immediately, doing so will cancel the attack. Only click again when the cursor changes, allowing you to do combos if you click in time. It definitely takes some getting used to.Collect as much information as you can on the enemies you have to face, it's important to read the Journal, especially the pages on Monsters to learn what they're immune to, where they can be found, which fighting styles are efficient against them. It helps you a great deal. The Signs are very useful and fun, too.The controls during combat are pretty awkward sometimes, even if I had the right fighting style selected, I couldn't attack or hurt the enemies. I had to switch to another style and then back for it to decide to work again.StoryAfter the low point, here comes the best part. The story in this game is incredible. It's very detailed, very deep and exciting. The dialogues are filled with humour and deep philosophical thoughts here and there.The world is consistent, the characters are likeable and unique, after a while you find yourself caring about many of them. They all respond to your actions and choices. There's quite a number of decisions you have to make that (sometimes pretty heavily) affect the story and your relationship to certain characters. I loved the amount of freedom I had in the game, I was never forced to get in an intimate relationship with any character or play dice, etc. - it's entirely up to the player.The way women were portrayed though - boobs, boobs and more boobs. I've seen more boobs in this game than my own. :P Jokes aside, I simply had to play very carefully when others were in the same room with me, because almost every woman you can interact with is um... underdressed. Good for Geralt I guess. .)As you play more and more, the story just drags you in - even if you don't like the combat or the gameplay, it's definitely worth to play this through just for the story alone.Animation and voicesThis is something I wasn't entirely pleased with. Yes, it's not a game from today, but the characters often looked very stiff, which is not a good thing when there's a lot of dialogue. Another thing which detracts from the experience is the mediocre voice acting. First I found it very awkward, but got used to it eventually and after a certain point it simply didn't bother me anymore.(I kept finding the same character models throughout the game though, now that did annoy me a bit.)Music and atmosphereThe music was pretty great, fast paced and dark when needed, beautiful and calming while exploring beautiful areas. It really spiced some great moments up. Same with the atmosphere, the time of day really sets the mood of some locations, as well as the occasional rain and storms.I also loved the art style, there's some gorgeous artwork during storytelling parts.Summary:+ nice visuals+ amazing story with brilliant dialogues+ great music and atmosphere- combat might be hard to get used to- bad animationsIt took me 46 hours to finish the adventure and it's become one of my all-time favourite games. If you can get used to the combat and want to take a break from no-brainers, I highly recommend The Witcher, it's going to be an amazing and unforgettable experience.;1;50,2;30/04/2015;1368;80
19;Action; 16,99;Should you still play the Witcher 1 in 2020? That’s a fair question to ask, considering that this game is now 13 years old with its release in October 2007.  Cons With a game that is 13 years old, it’s clear that its age will show in some aspects. One of these is the outdated  graphics  . (Especially if you play without any mods, like I did). Also, there aren't a lot of different character models for the NPC’s, so you will encounter a lot of clones. Personally, this didn’t bother me that much, but it may be distracting for some players. The game has a  slow start  . In the beginning, you may find yourself annoyed by the point and click combat or the slow start to the story. But I will promise you, the game really does get better the further you get. After some time, I even found myself enjoying the combat, I just needed to get used to it.The Navigation  was a bit frustrating. It’s really annoying how often the direct way is blocked so you have to walk all the way around, even though you can already see your destination. There is no fast traveling.  During some parts of the game, you can teleport to certain locations, but that doesn’t change the fact that 40% of your play time will just be walking around from one place to another, which can feel a bit annoying at times, especially considering the amount of backtracking needed if you really want to finish all side quests and contracts. Fighting feels very clunky.   There is no active dodging, and if you get stunned when fighting more than two enemies, you can proceed to grab a cup of tea while watching said enemies slowly beat Geralt to death because no matter how frantically you press your keys, you will not get out of that situation. There is no animation cancelling.   Animations have to finish before you can start doing something else. After you drink a potion or eat something, Geralt has to stand still for the whole duration of the animation before you can move or drink another potion. This may be intended but feels unnatural and a bit clunky. Every normal person can move while drinking, especially while being chased by monsters. But our Geralt here is different. He likes to drink his potions in peace of mind, as if he has all the time in the world, not minding the monsters attacking him while doing so. If you play on normal difficulty,   the game will be too easy   , especially later on. The only boss fight that felt challenging to me was the Chapter 1 boss fight, because I hadn’t levelled my Aard sign at all (note that with levelled Aard sign, it is also very easy). But the later boss fights, especially the final ones in Chapter 5 and the epilogue, are way too easy if you know how to use alchemy and signs. Because of that, I recommend playing the game on the hardest difficulty and not on normal difficulty.Also, you can’t pick up loot during combat. The game makes you wait around 3 seconds after combat finishes before you are allowed to pick something up. In conclusion   , the negative points mostly concern the lack of convenience we are used to from newer games. Most of these points only caused me minor frustration and didn’t stop me from playing and enjoying the game. ProsIt’s worth discovering how  the story  of the Witcher games started, because it’s a great, immersive story. For someone who read all the books and already played Witcher 3, it was a great experience to discover how the games continue to develop the story from the books.  The world  . The world of the Witcher is grey and cruel, but it’s also rich in lovable and humorous characters and filled with a lot of lore to discover. Most characters are layered and have good reasons for their actions. almost no one is just evil for the sake of being evil but rather convinced that what they are doing is the right thing.   The choices   you make affect the story. A lot of times, there are various outcomes to a quest based on your decisions. The world isn’t simply black and white. The developers stayed true to Andrzej Sapkowski’s notion of “Choosing the lesser evil” from the books. Even though the most canon choice is to stay neutral in the conflict presented in the game, it is up to the player if he wants to side with one of the two factions (Sco’iatel or Order of the Flaming Rose) or not.  The soundtrack  : This game has one of the best video game soundtracks imo, the music helps creating an immersive atmosphere. The levelling system  : You can personalize the combat by putting skills in magic signs, alchemy, bombs or the different sword styles.  Combat tactics : I love the fact that you have be tactical in combat and that alchemy and signs actually matter. In order to deal damage, it is crucial to pick the right sword (silver for monsters and steel for humans), the right style and to use the right potions. You can’t just mindlessly slice through enemies  play time  : There are a lot of things to do in the Witcher, there are a lot of side quests, contracts and trophies. If you don’t plan on rushing the main story, you have around 50 hours of content.  Price:  I picked it up for like 1-2 Euro on sale, and the amount of content you get for the price is amazing.  Conclusion  The worst part of this game is definitely its controls and the general inconvenience, which may make it feel like a slog to some players. But if you manage to get used to that, it’s still a very good game with a great world and story. I recommend the game to everyone who isn't too bothered by aged controls and I think it's still worth your time to play this game in 2020.  “Evil is Evil. Lesser, greater, middling… Makes no difference. The degree is arbitrary. The definition’s blurred. If I’m to choose between one evil and another… I’d rather not choose at all.” ― Andrzej Sapkowski, The Last Wish;1;62,8;13/10/2020;408;6
19;Action; 16,99;When I first played The Witcher, I was in middle school and I had pirated the game. Like most middle schoolers, I wasn’t very smart and the only thing I really looked for in a game was how many bad guys I could murder. I finished the game and quickly forgot about it. Only after I was in college did I realize to the full extent the awful choices that I had made during my first playthrough of The Witcher. My crimes were beyond description. I killed street dogs and innocent travelers just to loot 2 orens worth of stuff from their corpses. I slept with women and promptly abandoned them to be murdered by angry mobs or overzealous knights. I killed a fellow witcher. I walked away from a chance to have a happy family with a woman who loved me in order to sleep with my sex buddy sorceress who I thought looked hotter. I helped commit mass genocide, murdering dozens of non-humans fighting for freedom.By chance I happened to see The Witcher: Enhanced Edition on sale during Steam Summer Sale 2014. I took it as a sign from heaven. Lord Gaben the Redeemer was speaking to me through my computer, offering me a chance to atone for my sins of the first playthrough. Now I could do what I had not done in middle school. I would uphold justice and help the weak. I would be the hero that Vizima needed, but not the one it deserved. And I could do it with 75% off. I clicked buy and my $1.99 ascended to the heavens while the face of Lord Gaben smiled down upon me.;1;58,0;28/08/2014;1258;792
19;Action; 16,99;Many think this game was bad, it's not. What people really mean is, "this is from 2008 and I don't like that."Each of the three games had their pros and cons. The combat is a con for most folks but its really not that bad. You have to use certain sword styles against different opponents and you have to time your mouse clicks to keep the combo going. The difference being, in W2 you have to time your clicks but style doesnt matter as much and in W3 you just left click until dead or spin to win. The alchemy portion is probably the best of the three. You have to learn your ingredients from books or people otherwise you just cant make your potions, and you absolutely need alchemy to survive. In W2 and W3 alchemy is great but the only thing you need to win is Cat and Swallow. The story of W1 is wonderful you meet so many great characters that come back throughout the series and you can see how the relationships Geralt has made have lasted over the years. The main story is long, in depth, and very interesting. You begin to slowly unravel the mystery of the Wild Hunt and the White Frost. The politics are ever present as well. Geralt always seems to find himself at the court of kings and you can learn about the political turmoil brewing in the region as Nilfgard starts to breath down the necks of Redania and Temeria. All in all, don't just write this one off as aged garbage. If you are truly a fan of the series and the lore its a must. There are even small hints at subplots throughout the series that will reward you for playing them in order. I hope you enjoy the Witcher as much as I have.;1;62,0;25/06/2017;229;3

19;Action; 16,99;The Witcher: Utterly brilliant, but rough and over-ambitiousThe first game in The Witcher series has often been called a "rough diamond", so my title doens't tell anything new. This review was wrtten just a couple of days before the release of The Witcher 3, and without having played The Witcher 2 yet. This way I hope to be able to look at the original game in the series with fresh eyes, not with the hindsight of the other games somewhere in the back of my head. It's also important to notice that this review addresses the final release of the game, from september 2008, i.e. The "Enhanced Edition: The Director's Cut". This version represents the developers' final thoughts and ideas on the game, and it differs considerably from any other version.In this game, the player takes the role of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher or a professional monster-slayer. There is no character-build menu, no fancy options about hair-colour or the width of your eyebrows. You are Geralt of Rivia, you are a Witcher. And to put it simple: the game is so utterly brilliant since it manages to let you believe that, almost from the start. Seldom have I felt so deeply connected to the character I was playing: after a couple of in-game hours, I started to think as Geralt, react to my surroundings as Geralt, even feel like Geralt: I was completely involved, the game got deep under my skin, I was bewitched. It's not that I played the game for hours and hours on end, or that I played through the night, no: it's more like I felt Geralt had become part of my life, not only while in-game, but also while not playing. I started to look for articles and websites to read about The Witcher and its world, and I even dreamt a couple of times about the game and its characters...The game's greatest strengths: the world, the story, the choicesAs is commonly known by now, the Polish developer CD Project Red started working on The Witcher – actually their first game – out of love for the books, novels and stories by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Sapkowksi is the author of The Witcher-universe: a collection of books and stories about a fictional, fantasy-world with a profound background and a history all of its own. Sapkowski has often been called "The Polish Tolkien", and while that might be too big a compliment, I often felt like I was part of a world that could hold its own against Tolkiens incredible rich universe. And I suppose that explains why I felt so connected to the game and so deeply involved: the world of The Witcher did already exist before the game, and is completely coherent and believable by itself.It is one thing to have an interesting world to build a game in, it's another to write and develop a story within this world that works well for a role-playing game. The story of The Witcher however succeeds brilliantly in keeping the player's interest. It is ambitious, full of twists and unexpected turns, but it stays believable right up to the end. The different characters, both Geralt and his main protagonists, are complex and multi-layered: hardly anyone in this world is just "good" or "evil": most of the time, its a mix of both, often with one or several other characteristics  added. The game does a fantastic job in introducing the player (Geralt) to this world, using an old trick: after having lost his memory, Geralt has to rediscover not only the places, the stories and the people, but he has to rediscover himself: he has to give himself a place in the dark, conflict-ridden world he lives in.The main way to do this, is by making choices: the game's strongest point by far is the feeling you get that the decisions you make actually matter, and do influence the flow and even the outcome of the story. This is especially impressive since almost every choice, from minor to very important, is difficult and hardly clear-cut. The games offers tons of dialogues, more than 5000 lines of text to be read and/or said, but very seldom did I feel like doing the "good thing". In most cases, the situation was so dire or the possible answers so gruff, that I had a hard job to make decisions that felt "right" at all. It was more like "trying to do my best, and hoping for the best", since often decisions or roads taken early in the game, proved to have unexpected consequences (much) later on. The way in which this game manages to make me think about good and evil, about morality and consequences, is utterly and completely brilliant.The game's problem: it tries too hard to be the best rpg in the worldFrom whatever angle you look at it, it is obvious that The Witcher is a very, very ambitious game. The developers made no secret of it that, even back in 2007 when they were almost unknown, they wanted to make "the best rpg ever". Ambition definitely is a good thing for any developer, it can also be a trap. While CD Project Red succeeded brilliantly with everything story- and character-related, they paid dearly in some other departments. The actual gameplay, the movement and combat, form the game's biggest downfalls. As a matter of fact, lots of people have tried the game, only to leave it after running into frustration with the combat system. Combat is an exercise in rythmical feeling: by clicking at the right moment, Geralt can chain attacks together so that they become much stronger. Fast clicking is of no use whatsoever, as is blocking or parrying since the game takes care of that.Moreover, Geralt has two different swords (steel for humans and animals, silver for monsters) and three differend combat styles (strong, fast and group style) at his disposal, so choosing the right weapon and the right sword for any fight is an important issue. Combat is much more tactical than in most rpg's, and since dozens of alchemical potions, lots of special coatings for either of your swords, six magical signs and even some bombs are thrown into the equation as well, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by this avalanche of ideas. Still, when one is prepared to play the game slow, with lots of attention to the myriad of entries in the journal (on quests, people, monsters, alchemical ingredients, recipes or locations), the sense of fulfillment can be enormous. This is most of all true of the alchemy, which is a very important part of the game. It takes a time to get the hang of it, when once mastered, it proves very rewarding.Final thoughtsPlaying and mastering The Witcher felt like climbing a mountain: it takes time, patience and commitment, even preparation, but once everything gets going, the long way to the summit becomes a joy by itself. In the case of the first game in the series, the mountain definitely is not Mount Everest nor even Mont Blanc, and the path is littered with dangerous spots and possible downfalls, but the scenery is gorgeous nonetheless, and the journey towards the summit proved one I won't ever forget.Gameplay: 25/30 (provided one takes the time to master the combat system)Graphics: 16/20 (the game looks brilliant for its age)Sound: 8/10 (the music is fantastic, the voice-acting is not)Technical stability: 9/10 (I got no crashes whatsoever with this final edition)Steam integration: 7/10 (like any older game, it comes without cards or achievements)Game for the money: 9/10 (it's a very long game, but it's not an open-world sandbox)Personal appreciation: 10/10Overall Score: 84/100;1;80,2;15/05/2015;279;11
19;Action; 16,99;Combat is not as bad as you have heard, but then again i grew up in the 80's and 90's so ive seen worse, and enjoyed worse! I actually like the combat, it is different from anything i have played in over 10 years. For a dollar and some change?!?!?! seriously? why would you complain?!?!?! there are so many games for this same price that are shallow and boring, this has depth and more than 40 plus hours to play. Multiple crashes, not SLI freindly at first. But after the intro (about 20 min) no crashes at all.  let's be honest, its a good game. I LIKE IT. BUT you have to treat games like a new girlfriend:  they are all different and you have to figure out how they work. ONCE you do this it is enjoyable. I see far too many people expecting it to be like witcher 3....it is not. Its not supposed to be. But seriously its a dollar and some change: give it a shot! if you don't like it why complain? I have paid full price on tripple AAA titles that were far worse. If you can throw a buck fifty for a soda pop, why not pick up something that will last hours and hours.;1;80,5;31/05/2017;164;5

19;Action; 16,99;The Witcher manages to be one of the best RPGs that I have played in spite of many little flaws. There are times the game will frustrate you in minor ways, and yet the game deserves the cult classic status it enjoys. The story is dark and engaging,   the world is deep and lore filled, and the moral ambiguity will have you racked with doubt about the choices you have made. But make no mistake, you will make choices in this game, and you will have to bear the responsibility those choices bring.If you dont mind working through a clumsy interface, and like a game that makes you work for it: The Witcher: Enhanced Directors Cut may be the game for you.See my full review here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSb1Z380XCM;1;76,1;19/04/2015;251;4
