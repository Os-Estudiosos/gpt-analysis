Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game!;Really enjoyed playing AC Odyssey! If not for the fun of playing a great game but it's also feel good to just roam in the beautiful Mediterranean setting!;9/10;31 December 2020;11 out of 12 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Good gameplay, awful story.;It's enjoyable to play ACO if you will ignore story and especially dialogs. Amazing level design, good gameplay, nice graphics, not bad voices. But man, that story so flat, it sucked almost like Justice league. And the dialog even more, absolutely horrible and very poorly written. The idea with cultist very good. And dialogs and choices are horrible and useless. Too many historical persons with flat personality, would be better to have one two but more interesting and deeper character.;7/10;26 June 2019;34 out of 57 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Beautiful game with the storytelling of a 4-year old;Well-designed game, but the dialogues and story arc make you wish it was over sooner rather than later. Nothing is missed by skipping them.;7/10;19 April 2020;26 out of 43 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;This Game Is Everything and More;I am not a pro gamer, nor do I play video games on a regular basis but I could not help but appreciate all the hard work and care the developers and actors of AC: Odyssey put into this creation. For someone who had been enjoying reading about Ancient Greece and all the myths and legends surrounding that period, this game delivers an unforgettable immersive experience. I am grateful to everyone at Ubisoft who helped bring (in my case) Alexios's story to life. I loved every minute of 200+ hours I spent playing the game and its DLCs to the point that I did not want it to end. The ease of movements, engaging weapon and gear system, cool abilities, gorgeous locations, truly all-climbable obstacles and the seamless interconnectivity of it all throughout the progression of the game deserve the utmost recognition. I am grateful for all the choices I was given a chance to make, for the moments of awe, laughter and tears I have experienced. Keep up the great work, Ubisoft Quebec!;10/10;6 February 2021;19 out of 22 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;8 hours in, haven't gotten bored once.;I haven't played an Assassins Creed game since Black Flag, so I saw Odyssey was on sale for cheap and decided to get it. It hasn't let me down once. I love the story, it's easy to keep track of and lets you explore the open world between tasks, building up the in game world just that much more. The combat system is nicely done, if you get down the timing on dodging or blocking then you should have no problem with most of the enemy's. It never forces you into a difficulty and you can turn it higher or lower whenever you like. Happy playing!;10/10;9 December 2020;12 out of 16 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;What happened?;This game is a masterpiece, massively awesome. Less than a month ago, this game had a 9.1 rating on this site, now it has an 8.3, what happened? Did Red Dead fans want to hate on it because they didn't win Game if the year? Or people just hating on it?;10/10;16 December 2018;67 out of 121 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Awesome;What an awesome and amazing game! Massive open world with no end of exploring and interactions. Great game design and attention to detail. And when you set game difficulty to hard they deliver. And the mercs are a great challenge and very rewarding when defeated. Now one of my favs. Strongly recommended.;10/10;16 December 2018;30 out of 50 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Perfect;No complaints game was better than expected. Story was entertaining, gameplay was fun, and game was long which i enjoyed.;10/10;8 October 2021;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game;Great story line and game play. You almost forget that you're playing Assassins Creed, it' more of an adventure quest (depending on the mode you pick) from start to finish. The fighting style is smoother than the last and the abilities list is very dynamic to fit your fighting style. This is the number one game of the year as of right now. Red Dead Redemption has it's hands full.;10/10;5 October 2018;47 out of 91 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Good game;I enjoyed the gameplay and the world is vast and pretty. The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are nice. However, the story and characters lack development, voice acting and animations were bad compared to Origins and other AC game and the ending was disappointing.;6/10;11 April 2019;15 out of 32 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Back to its best.;Assassin's creed odyssey is the assertion and the reformation of a stale franchise, that in the break of a year and a release later, stands as one of the best RPG's out there and certainty rivalling assassin's creed 2 in this particular franchise.From the stunning world, to the brilliant combat, to the incredible performance of Kassandra, this game is one of the best of the generation (certainly top 10). Ubisoft have really revitalised a franchise that was on the verge of collapse. Assassin's creed odyssey is stunning. The games fundamentals and basic elements far exceed that of any other assassin's creed game. The performance of Melissa Mahut as Kassandra is incredible as she manages to nail so many different emotions and feelings the character may feel through the awesome new choices made throughout and does it in some style, hence her being nominated at the game awards for it. Ancient Greece is one of the best looking worlds I've ever seen with incredible amounts of detail as ubisoft continued this after the wonderful world of Origins (Egypt). The Gameplay is fun and keeps you changing up styles frequently, a thing that many games struggle with. The choices aid this also as you never know how the game will come back at you, if you lie, romance or kill someone.All in all this game is one of the best and ignore that moron that complains that it isn't assassin's creed anymore. This is the best assassin's creed has ever been (except 2). Ubisoft have really outdone themselves and despite the 50-80 hours of play through this game is not to be missed. I encourage anyone that hasn't, to buy this game. This truly is one of the best this generation.;10/10;13 June 2019;19 out of 34 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Overwhelming.;Too big. As soon as started I'm having so much overwhelming missions thrown my way half of which mean nothing just an excuse to get xp up.Sync points.No a lot of quick travel points for something so big.Dead eyes. Once again assasins creed characters have no emotions In their face it's like talking to someone when both eyes are lazy.(I don't who their talking too)Making choices through dialogue. Nothing you decide really has that much of an affect they don't even have a karma metre to judge weather you've done good things or not.Overall graphics are pretty, the sword play is average and the story is predictable.;6/10;21 July 2019;10 out of 26 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;As large as an ocean but as deep as a puddle;Quality>quantity, for such a big game,it surely disappointed, its just copy and paste over and over, no originality or uniqueness;1/10;5 June 2020;23 out of 42 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Positively excellent;Graphics, everything looks stunning. Story starts off slow but it does pick up. Massive map to explore with plenty to do.;10/10;3 March 2019;18 out of 34 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game play and combat, weak story and characters;Okay let me start this review with it is AMAZING. I, personally chose Alexios for my first play through but playing it for a second time I chose what I think is the better option, Kassandra. So far I've played about 20 hours with Kassandra and 150 with Alexios and this game is pure gold. The game play was flowed with action, (I like to use the bows) whether your using a sword, ax, or bow its so much fun. There are no glitches I've come across so far but I must say that in the beginning, I hated the game. I picked it up at gamestop and said hey lets give it a go but It just didn't seem that great. But I thought this game has good reviews so lets play some more. That was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. Personally, I don't enjoy Assassin's Creed games to much. I played Origins, It blew me a way so I knew I HAD to try Odyssey out, I also played Unity which I thought was great and its graphics were way ahead for a 2014 game, but this game felt different. It didn't feel like an Assassin's Creed game, which maybe was the reason I liked it so much and that's the reason why maybe some don't like it as much. It still focuses on game play which is good, but I feel it has a weak story. There good characters and all, but It seems that the side characters have more depth and the developers put more thought into them like Myrrine, than the main protagonist themselves. For the full experience I think you should chose Kassandra because of the dialogue and just overall more natural character, but if you chose Alexios, be my guest because he's just as good. Overall Odyssey is great game with great graphics and content, but has a weak story and characters that just ruin the experience.;10/10;2 February 2022;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game, but short from being perfect;Greetings from Lithuania.So after finishing all the DLC's for the game as well as main game and platinum it, i can safely say that "Assassin's Creed Odyssey" (2018) is a really great game, overall. More then a few times during my first 50 hours of game play (it took me eventually almost 125 hours to do it fully, but without rushing it), i stopped and simply looked around and was amazed of how amazingly the game simply looks. The graphics are out of this world beautiful. The world itself looks amazing and feels amazing. Colors are gorgeous. Combat system was very good for me personally. I liked the main story and found it interesting. The open world side quests were hit and miss because there really interesting ones and very boring ones. Exploration was another thing that i enjoyed it very much. But then when DLC came, they were pretty boring for me personally, and all i wanted is just to finish the game and move forward.Overall, i really enjoyed "Assassin's Creed Odyssey". I will be looking forward for next installments. Its not perfect, but its a damn great stuff.;9/10;27 August 2019;11 out of 20 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Quite possibly the best Assassin's Creed game since Part 2;I got this game when it was on sale along with another Ubisoft game, For Honor. After playing the first level, which is kinda like Dynasty Warriors before you enter the main game and exploring the island as a man or woman, it gets interesting. The graphics sound and controls are pretty good despite having frame rate being the same speed as other games of this generation like Red Dead which is still the best game of last year. Like most Ubisoft games, it has Uplay as well as the Ubisoft Club rewards program and you'll get lots of achievements too as you progress through the game. Highly recommended if you love history and stealth.;10/10;19 May 2019;11 out of 21 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Amazing Game;Wow.. this game was incredible! From combat to climbing to overall story. This game accomplished all of it. The players choice between alexios and kassandra is a great aspect of the game where most games don't give the player the option to pick which story you want to pursue(after playing I highly suggest playing as kassandra). I won't bore you too much but I absolutely loved this game and would highly suggest for others to play it.;10/10;30 March 2020;9 out of 17 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;One of the best words ever.;Out of all the Assasins creed games this is the most unfairly hated on. It has an unbelievably detailed and vibrant world that you can explore for hours. The gameplay is pretty good and some side quests are fantastic. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone but it does come with several issues. First of all the story is extremely forgettable, it's not bad but I can't even remember everything that happens. Another problem which in my opinion is the biggest is the pacing. The game forces you to do side quests to level up and it kills any sense of forward movement in the story. Honestly if you just removed the story and just had a ton of side missions I might have liked it better. The game overall though is over-hated and just because you don't play as an assassin by title doesn't mean the whole game is garbage.;7/10;20 February 2024;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;It keeps getting bigger and better.;Rainbow six siege is a tactical and methodical first person shooter developed by Ubisoft. Currently 1.6 million people play this game everyday, and it's vastly growing. As you first enter the game, you will feel the urge to rush into a heavily barricaded room and kill everyone to feel like a bad ass. Although this may sound fun, this is no call of duty. This game requires communication between teammates, searching for you enemy and having the will to be patient. You must be patient. For anyone who has ever played overwatch, this game will feel slightly similar with it's 'operator' system. Meaning each playable character has their own unique ability, varying from toxic smoke grenades to a stim pistol that can revive your teammates. You may play as an attacker or defender, on attack you must use your drones to locate either a hostage, a bomb or a bio-hazard container. Once the objective is located you must plan an attack to infiltrate the building and secure one of these three unique modes. On defense, well you guessed it, you have to defend. This means scouting the area on cameras, planting booby traps and reinforcing walls to stop the attackers from breaching in easily. But siege provides something more than just shooting and searching. It creates a large intense atmosphere that no game I have played has ever managed to capture before. It uses gritty and realistic game play mechanics to really make the player feel as if they are breaching a building. Once you're dead, you're dead, you can't respawn until the nest round, this may be off putting to some, but this means more communicating and tactical teamwork. I have had rainbow for a few months now, and haven't got bored once. This game is a definitely must buy and is totally different to anything I've played before. Pick this game up next time you have the chance, you won't regret it.;8/10;25 September 2016;8 out of 10 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Ubisoft did a GOOD?!;This is a great multiplayer game, I come back to it every couple of months for a couple of months because of how good it is. It's one of the most tactical games I've ever played which means you have to not be an absolute dough ball when playing the game, you have to strategies and work well with your team mates to win which can create feuds very quickly between players and makes the game extremely sweaty. The operators each having unique abilities also adds a lot to the game, you have to gain not be a complete dough ball and pick the right character for a given situation. Overall for a game that is constantly on deals to lower the price,mot is worth a cheeky purchase. One thing I will say and that I have noticed with some of my friends is that new players struggle a lot, it is a difficult game to start but if you keep playing it is satisfying and it can be enjoyed.;7/10;19 February 2021;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Really good multiplayer tactical shooter;I've play this game since 2016 operation health and i enjoy this game so much. This is not a game that encourage you to run and gun like a superhero, this game encourage you to be tactical. Played with my friends thinking about a good strategy to defeat the opposing team, though laugh at time when doing something stupid. The monetization is okay for me because almost everything is unlock if you play the game and not forced to buy anything because all items is just outfits for your operator. But the game drawback for me is the connection to the server is quite bad, at times suddenly disconnect from match for no reason and the sound bug is annoying me. I recommend this game if you're like tactical shooters.;9/10;1 October 2020;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Rainbow Six Siege is the greatest Home Alone simulator;After reaching level 99 in this game I can say it is the peak of Ubisoft Shooters. Fast paced, heart pounding and break-neck moments are what make up most of Six Siege. Mastering the operators, the maps and the mechanics are what make this a stand out game. It's almost a puzzle game, finding a hole in the defence with the right operator for the right situation. Each operator has their niche, be it Thermite at making an entrance or Montagne with his supporting capabilities. They all have their place in a match and learning that is key. The thrill of mastering Pulse, stalking the hallways of the map using cover to hide and then, when they least expect it, flanking them with a semi-automatic shotgun is the highlight of my time with this game. This game has made me enjoy Ubisoft once again, which is quite an accomplishment considering the disappointment of Watch_Dogs.;10/10;28 April 2016;11 out of 14 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Amazing and brilliant;This game is so good not just because it's a fun shooter but it's also very tactical you have to actually think you can't just go guns blazing all the time it's probably my favorite game of 2017-2018;10/10;11 March 2018;6 out of 8 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;How Games Should Make You Feel;Edge of your seat tactical first person shooter done to perfection.

Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Best FPS if I do say so my self. Way to go Ubisoft;I love this game so much. The amount of tactics put into this game and all the other stuff like breaking walls, shooting through them. And how much your aim matters is just awesome. So many operators and surely more to come.;10/10;31 October 2019;3 out of 4 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;A great potential ruined by toxic community and bad PC gamepad controls;After having played so many Call of Duty games, CS:GO and Team Fortress 2, this game feels like a step back, especially when you play it with a controller in which case the aiming is almost impossible. It feels like it has really clunky controls. The aiming is very hard with players like Clash and Montagne. We cannot pick up the weapons dropped by dead enemies (this made sense in Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch since they are class-based characters but there's no reason here). There are a lot of smurf accounts that abuse us for not playing on their level (even though we are in the Newcomers level), and there is no way to report such players.In terms of visual appeal this game is great. There are also a large number of maps to choose from, which makes this game look like it had a lot more potential. There are also plenty of characters to choose from. Though it lacks a campaign mode, it makes up for it with Challenges (which are also very difficult for new players). So overall I'd say it's a gorgeous looking game ruined by its bad controls and community.;6/10;24 March 2021;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;AMAZING GAME !!!;Its Better than Fortnite!Way more action based and way more fun playstyle then battle royal games like fortnite;10/10;28 October 2018;5 out of 9 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Was fun at the start but the novelty starts to wear thin.;I liked the Rainbow Six novel, and I thoroughly enjoyed the original Rainbow Six games, particularly the very first game released in 1998 and on of my favourite games of all time Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield (2003). The best thing about it was the playability of the single player campaign, which Rainbow Six: Siege sorely lacks, instead has a huge emphasis on multiplayer following in the footsteps of such games as Call of Duty and Battlefield.Although Rainbow Six: Siege is what you make of it, I find the game to be mostly repetitive and multiplayer missions is a different experience. If you fail the mission or don't perform up to standard you can expect a backlash from other players online. The game has its moments but it's hardly addictive gameplay.As a Rainbow Six fan, it is such a shame considering I was eagerly looking forward to a new Rainbow Six game. If Rainbow Six sticks with what previously attracted many players to the game I would consider staying faithful to the series, but seeing as I feel that Rainbow Six: Siege felt like a average experience, I am not so sure.Unless you enjoy strategic multiplayer games you may enjoy it, otherwise if you are a fan of shoot em up games you won't get much enjoyment out of it.6/10.;6/10;11 December 2015;6 out of 23 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Simple, but Great and Highly Re-Playable;In just one sentence: Rainbow Six: Siege is a great shooter that is a lot of fun to play.There isn't really much of a story. There are terrorists and different CTUs from around the world need to stop them. So, don't go in expecting a story. As there really isn't one.The graphics for the game are quite good and passable for a late 2015 game. The weapons look sleek and well designed. The sounds they make are incredible.The gameplay is where Siege shines. Simple, but intense, every moment mattering games that change every round. Each round, a group of attackers seek out the defenders and try to eliminate them. The defenders have time to prepare by setting up reinforced walls, dropping body armor for your teammates, and placing trip mines. Every second that goes by matters, and any second something can happen. Ranging from a drone entering a room to mark players, to a wall exploding, to a flash bang going off and blinding everyone, to a bullet coming through a window and killing your teammate. This is before getting into how important sound is. Listening to your surroundings can save your life and help you achieve victory.If you are looking for a shooter that will keep you playing for weeks and even months, Rainbow Six: Siege is the game for you!;10/10;14 May 2016;3 out of 5 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;A bare bones SWAT with great mechanics;I don't mind the exclusion of a campaign, even if these are what the series is known for, but it is still unfortunate due to the quality of the sole such co-op mission after the string of alibi tutorials. The sequel will certainly have one and this sub-series should be renamed to S.W.A.T. due to the similar nature of this game to that dead franchise. The multiplayer mode is pretty fascinating and the unique gameplay is rock solid but the lack of content and customization is noticeable. The game thus feels somewhat uncompleted for a full price game yet i will come back for the sequel and will stick around longer if it will feature more content. 7,5/10;7/10;15 April 2016;2 out of 7 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Ending the journey that started with Velvet Shell;When I first played Siege, I admired the Ubisoft's take on modern tactical combat, which was like the SWAT games, it was also one of the best perks of Siege. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, two major problems have been already slowly growing. Community and money.When Ubisoft went to the sci-fi world and added futuristic gadgets and powers for the operators, it was a matter of time when the game would lose its perk of great realistic tactical combat and turn into another new Black Ops game. With constant map changes and new flashy skins, I couldn't recognize the Siege I was playing. You don't need to regularly release new maps and ops, just work on the ops you already have and optimize the gameplay towards balance. Releasing new stuff won't fix the problems.Community has gotten bigger and surely it brought new ways to make the game more unenjoyable. Cheaters are roaming through the servers without instant consequences, it takes days and months to finally ban them but that would be already too late for the damages they caused. Intentional teamkill is still not fixed properly and it's even worse when you meet a bad group of teammates.A company hungry for money but not happiness of players. They would rather release new 50 sets of cosmetic items than fixing a single problem.;4/10;26 August 2021;5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Very addictive;I love this game, it's a fantastic online game with so many operators and weapons to choose from, it's definitely one of the best online tactical multiplayer games ever made. My only downfall to this game is the online servers, my connection is very good to play this game but it always disconnects me to play it and I have to keep restarting the game to get it connected. If the servers where a bit better I would have definitely have given this game a 10/10, but besides the server issue I still think it's an amazing game I would recommend people to try it out.;6/10;12 August 2021;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Great but coulda been perfect;Back in the day this around I'd say season 1-12 this game was a 9.7/10 but with all the new updates and toxic community the game got worse and worse every season sadly. Though, this game is a great fps shooter, personally my favorite of all time, they have good dlcs, great characters which you can choose from like 60 of them maybe even more. Lastly, But after the seasons kept going the gameplay went down because the recent updates that jus aren't good and no where near as good as the first 4 seasons.I think rainbow six siege should make a remastered version of the old rainbow six siege do y'all agree ?;8/10;11 June 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Unlimited Potential, Limited Developers.;Rainbow Six: Siege is a first person shooter unlike any other. With gunplay that is innovative, responsive, tactical, and most importantly, unique. Siege offers gameplay on quite literally every dimension, from the floorboards to the skylight on top of a bank. Everything in this game is able to be modified by the player. Cosmetics are slightly limited to a paywall, yet you can still customize each operator to your personal liking over time. Every attachment changes how each gun feels, and it almost never gets boring using the same gun. Speaking of never getting boring, each kill feels satisfying, as if you look the other player in the eye and assert that you are the better player on each kill. Nothing in Rainbow Six: Siege gets stale, and the 5 on 5 bomb defusing style has never been adapted better. Siege is a clear sign of innovation in a genre that had seemingly been ran dry.;7/10;12 April 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Amazing Villain;An amazing game with various mechanics,a good progression system and amazing story with well written villains especially Joseph Seed.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Tons of Choas and an Interesting Characters Trade Off for a Thin Plot and a Disappointing Ending;The concept of Far Cry 5 was the primary reason I picked up Far Cry 5 but a friend of mine recommended highly as well. I wasn't familiar with the Far Cry series but having played Far Cry 5, I loved the open world mechanics of it. I think it stacks up to the best in the genre (Rockstar's titles, Ubisoft's other franchises etc.). There's a chaotic nature to it that's a lot fun and there's always something going on. This is true of other open-world games, but I also loved the setting. Setting it in Montana, the lush forests and American Midwest setting offer a lot of unique wildlife and creative environments to travel through. It added to a different feel than other sandbox games I've played.The plot of Far Cry 5 is best looked at one of two ways. The plot has a good setup, you're trying to dismantle the cult piece by piece (even if you have to ignore the plot hole that your character should be high-tailing it out of the state for help the first chance he/she gets) and take care of the villainous Joseph Seed and his lieutenants John, Jacob and Faith. You get the choice of which area to go to (its divided into 5 areas, each of the lieutenants controls a portion of the map then Dutch's island and the actual compound for Eden's Gate cult) and the game plays out in the same way no matter where you go. Other than taking these people out and saving your friends, there is no progression until you hit the ending conflict. This is too bad, but I think the game compensates by giving you interesting friends (my favourites being Cheesburger the bear, Peaches the cougar and Boomer the dog) and interesting villains. John, Jacob and Faith are all vile in different ways but they all suffered from various forms of abuse and Joseph preyed on that to indoctrinate them into his twisted way of thinking. You fight them, but I did find that I could either relate to them or sympathize with them even if it was just for fleeting moments. Joseph is a monster, but he was formed to be that as opposed to just being born that way. This is a trade off, but it was more than enough to keep me going.The reactions to Far Cry 5 have been mixed and while some of that can be chalked up to the "politically" charged nature of it, I have to agree that the criticism of the ending is valid. The game offers 2 endings depending on a final choice (there's also a hidden ending that you can get at the beginning) and I picked the "true" ending. They leave you some bread crumbs to hint at it if you're listening to the radio, but I found it to be such a shock. I thought about it for a while and I do like the dark nature of it, but it doesn't seem to fit the rest of the game. It nullifies most of the story and while it didn't wreck the total experience, I didn't enjoy it and I agree with the negative reviews on this point. My final reaction was: "Did they really think this was the best way to end it?"This is one of those games that comes down to a simple calculation for me. The pros outweigh the cons by a decent margin, even if it wasn't everything I wanted it to be. As someone who hadn't played any of the previous Far Cry games, this was fairly easy to pick up, it played in a different environment and gave me interesting friends and foes to bounce off of. The variation in the missions helped keep things fresh and I liked how I could do anything I wanted at any time. The trade off for the characters is that there isn't much progression in the plot and while I thought the ending is unique and very dark, it didn't work for me and I felt like I got sucker punched by it. I would still recommend this game, I'm going to be playing it again and while it wasn't the whole package, I'd grade it at around an 8.5/10. I'm rounding down because of the sour note it ended on.;8/10;30 May 2018;17 out of 22 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Wow;I'm still playing the campaign, but so far this game is breathtaking. The darkest Far Cry out of all of them. It's very disturbing and it will give chills by the opening introduction. This game is a winner.;9/10;28 March 2018;30 out of 50 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Yep;Five years down the road , and it's still a very good and fun game to play.I had my doubts at first, but with gamepass on the XboxX we all can play this nice game .Graphics hold up very well, after 5 years in the market it still looks very nice.Voices are pretty good, some funny comments as well.Characters are great, water looks like water, nice done.Big open world with a lot of things do, secret doors, hidden chests etc I like it.What wasn't that good is the Ai, sometimes the enemies run by or don't know what to do.Also a few bugs, at some point I couldn't open the door, you have to do it all over again at the last savepoint.But overall a great game, worth your time and money.;8/10;5 May 2023;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Epic!;This is a great, deep and dark story with awesome voice acting! The Father character is ingeniously created.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Great game but if you are religious I strongly suggest avoiding it;Yes if you do happen to be religious this game may hit a little too close to home or even offend you but boy I gotta say I'm having so much fun with it, I may be playing as someone who's going on a full blown rampage but that just adds to the thrill, the action is the best part and if you do happen to like open-world games or first person shooters I highly recommend checking this one out. A rather disturbing story behind it too and funny enough this has better graphics than 6 but I have a feeling that 6 was meant to look more arcadey compared to this. Nonetheless the Far Cry games are great, this one though has to be my personal favorite.;10/10;12 September 2022;4 out of 5 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;By the dawn's early light.;'Far Cry 5 (2018)' marks the first time that a game in the series has been set in the USA. As such, it has come under fire for its politics. However, the game isn't saying anything particularly controversial. whatever political musings there may be, they're entirely perfunctory. The story puts you in the shoes of a rookie police officer tasked with bringing in the leader of a notorious local cult. When all hell breaks loose, you must rally your allies and, essentially, enforce a form of home-grown martial law to bring things back to the way they used to be. The narrative is delivered in a less straightforward way this time around, with the majority of the game taking place within three distinct districts that can be played in any order. The occasional cut-scene will move things along without you having any input, but for the most part you are in control of the story's progression. This incidental kind of vibe is appropriate for the game-loop, as it allows you to undertake your own mini adventures while you progress towards the greater overall goal. That goal is, as usual, to reclaim the map. This time, though, there are no towers to climb. Instead, the world simply reveals itself as you move through it, meeting all manner of quirky character and delirious foe as you go. The map is chock full of content, most of which is driven by specific characters and, therefore, feels more important than the busywork it actually is. The 'buddy' system does a great job of making you feel like you're really having an impact. when you save certain people, they become available as AI co-op partners. Though the thing has a good sense of progression, the actual plot is segmented and ultimately unfulfilling - thanks, in no small part, to a cheap, supposedly 'clever' rug-pull of an ending. The sections which remove your control are clearly the worst parts of the entire affair, feeling frustrating and jarring, to boot. It takes a while to for the game to get into its own groove, but once it does it's an entertaining time. It feels like a slight step down for the franchise, but it's an enjoyable open-world experience nevertheless. 7/10;7/10;27 March 2020;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Great gameplay, awful story.;The game is a blast to play. Exploring the wilderness and taking outposts with your followers is insane fun. You can have a pilot bomb your enemies from above, a sniper take them out from a nice vantage point, or have them all slapped to death by a diabetic grizzly. The worst part of the game is the story and having to listen to any of the main characters talk about their "deep dark philosophical principal" The ending is absolute trash writing.;7/10;7 May 2018;32 out of 50 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Amazing story with beautiful gameplay;Has a compelling story that keeps you sucked into the game from the jaw dropping start to the insane ending.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Cutscene Incompetence;Let me introduce you to the plot device cutscene incompetence.The Protagonist is amazing. They can defeat hordes of monsters, perform feats of superhuman strength, solve complex puzzles no one else can, answer the most baffling riddles, and is always just in time for the action... that is, as long as they are being controlled by the player.Once a cutscene starts, or the player otherwise loses even the tiniest bit of control over their character, however, things tend to go south quick.That is Farcry 5 in a nutshell. Need to move the story on? Cue the mind control music into cutscene! Walking into a church to confront a big enemy? Cutscene and you're knocked out! Played for a few hours and enjoying yourself? Bliss cutscene!It's bad storytelling. You don't need to be forced into capture each time you want to progress the story with the main bad guys of the game. Such a bad trope, IN MY 2018? It's happening more than you would like to admit.Like all next-gen Farcry games, the best story ending is to stay still at the start of the game and let the credits roll.;6/10;14 October 2018;26 out of 44 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;As good as a video game can get.;The campaign is amazing and offers hours of addicting and thrilling gameplay. The story is gripping and there are so many amazing characters you meet throughout your adventures. Even without the amazing campaign the hundreds of things you can do in the open world also help solidify this game as an all time great. The villain is compelling the missions are extremely fun and the Guns for Hire system is a really good addition for the far cry series. The vehicle mechanics and controls are perfect. The game as stunning graphics and any console and the open landscape is simply beautiful.;10/10;26 September 2018;6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Mediocre game with some highlights.;Let's start with the positive things:Hope County is an interesting place to discover The AI companions are fun Joseph Seed is a good character conceptionally, as is the story of a cult taking control of almost everythingBut that is basically it. Everything else is either mediocre or annoyed me.Gameplay, weapons, travelling and collecting things are all fine, really. Nothing to complain about, but nothing special either.Things that were really bad were the amount of glitches. Some were minor and just an inconvenience like button prompts not being correct, mission markers not working properly, ammo not displayed correctly and such. Every now and then I had to restart the game though.But the thing that really makes this game less than a good game for me (which would be an 8 on my scale) is the horrible disconnect. The protagonist is mute and I am not allowed to react in any way to basically anything. Basically there are two actual story choices in the game, everything else boils down to play or not play (a mission, but the game as well of course). Worse and making me angry is the fact that the plot allows my character to be captured without any chance to avoid it. It happens a dozen times. For one story arc, I get it, although it still annoys me, for two others there is a certain explanation, which theoretically makes sense, but is still kinda flimsy and so very frustrating and lazy. It is basically a way to have the enemies getting away with their monologues. But even when you are the one in control they are allowed to spew their nonsense.It is a frustrating game, but if you buy it for around 30 bucks it may be worth it. I don't begrudge giving them my money, although the trajectory since FC3 is barely going upwards.;6/10;30 July 2019;7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Still a Fun Game.. but..;I usually give the FC games a 10/10 (except for Primal - sorry, I gave up on that after about 2 hours). This one was seriously ambitious, with beautiful scenery and all the usual crazy violent stuff that makes a Far Cry game. However, I gotta take three points off for this one. Every game on this scale has glitches of course, but the AI in this (on single-player) is just plain stupid, especially when you have a partner (even worse with two) assigned to your squad. First, they don't shut up - and when there's two of them and you're piloting a vehicle (car, boat, plane, etc), the convo-glitch between them is in full effect - repeating the same lines over and over. Second, they'll see a "Peggi" (bad guy) or hostile animal seemingly long before the hostile indicator lights up on your HUD and go ballistic. Same issue happens when talking to a character that you're trying to get a mission from. They'll be talking to you and suddenly see a bear just grazing in the grass 500 yards away and go into "conflict" mode and start running around being stupid - or worse, they'll jump into the vehicle you drove/flew up in and disappear into the void - leaving you to go seek another mission, by foot. Third, you waste plenty of time trying to get the AI partner(s) to get into your vehicle with you, especially a helicopter. They'll stand there or run around in circles forever before suddenly clicking and running into the seat. Like I said, every game has glitches, but these particular ones slow the flow of the game and make it frustrating - like continuously having to get out of your vehicle and back in it before the AI realizes it's time to go. And whatever you do, don't let your AI partners fly anything you're in. You'll never be able to get back into the plane or helicopter once you get out of it. no matter how many times you instruct them to land. As soon as your feet hit the ground, they'll immediately take off and just hover above you and you're stuck walking.Another point mark down for the 20+ minute unskippable and barely playable intro (every few minutes or so, you might get to push a button or slowly walk around during the opening sequence). The story-line really isn't that deep to force you to have to sit that long through the intro. It's Far Cry man.. I get it.. bad bosses got armies of bad dudes doing bad things.. let's get to slaying!And finally a point mark down for those stupid "Capture Squad" sequences, especially the "bliss" ones when in the female boss' territory. As you continue to wreak havoc in a boss' territory, eventually the boss gets pissed and sends his whole army to not kill you, but capture you so you can do some drug-induced shoot-em-up sequence, only to let you go to do more damage to their sanctioned area. This makes no sense.. if the boss has this capability, why not just end you 10 seconds after you cross into their territory? I know, a 5-minute game wouldn't sell that well, but still.But on good notes, fun, funny, and over-the-top violent as usual, sans the boring fishing missions. It's worth your dime and I'm sure some DLCs are yet to come. The final boss showdown is not as climatic as the sequence that happens after you do prevail - once you are able to save four or five of your people, it's not that hard to get through, but what happens afterwards is eyebrow raising. But the story-telling, main missions, graphics, and weapon-play are the usual Far Cry fun-time madness.Two notes: Gone are the radio-tower climbs. After the intro, there's one mission to climb a radio tower which is needed to open the full map, but that's the only required climb. There's some side missions that involve radio tower climbs, but not necessary to further the story line. Weapon variety is good, but really no need to load up/spend on all of them. Once I was able to afford the .50 cal sniper rifle and the high-powered scope, silencer, and extended mag, I was pretty much set. Taking down outposts hidden on a hill or rock-top was a breeze with that thing. You will need a good machine gun or rocket launcher to take down planes attacking you from the sky.;7/10;26 April 2018;10 out of 20 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;The best antagonist I ever seen;Far Cry is known for its antagonist and Far Cry 5 has given the best villain you can hope.Joseph Seed! I can't appreciate much, he don't need to act he can make you fear with his words. The best villain you will ever see in the game.The storyline and graphics are good enough to make you lost in the game for hours.The only thing I would criticize that Far cry5 should have given some backstory some presence for the deputy, It just feels like we have no part in the game. Deputy is only a moving camera no interaction to the world. And similarly to other Joseph seed should have been given more time to fight against him, after defeating his 3 siblings we have to directly fight against him in small and easy battle.Overall the game is good enough but should have improved much giving more depth to its villain and the protagonist.;8/10;21 October 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Superb fun;Greetings from Lithuania.I loved "Watch Dogs" 2 (2016). That said, this game offered for me even more then i expected. And i did not expected very much knowing (but not playing) how disappointing 1st game was considering how hyped it was by Ubisoft by its fake trailers at E3 back in the day. "Watch Dogs" 2 is a superb open world game, aka GTA 5 style but with a twist - instead of gun blazing every mission you must relay on your hacking skills - sure you can also go gun blazing here as well, but its more fun to use environment to create distractions, traps, or even a gang wars (and i used a lot of those) to achieve your objective. There are also a tons of fun activities in this world. You can play co-op - which is very fun, but there isn't that much of variety in co-op. Dialog were clever and also funny - this game is funny and its approach is very lighthearted. Overall, "Watch Dogs 2" is a very fun game. It has great and involving open world with fun activities, good story and superb game play. Hacking itself was very creative and overall experience felt like a breath of fresh air. Highly fun and addictive game overall.;10/10;25 July 2018;16 out of 19 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Gameplay vs story;The 1st game had a slightly slugging first half but I ended up liking it a lot overall. The often ridiculed and deliberately unlikable Aiden Pearce and the near nihilistic story stood out to me. The game had an identity, plain and simple. I only need a bit more gameplay variety for a sequel and I certainly got that but at what cost! The admittedly more involved hacking is now suddenly Pipe Mania and the overall game fully transformed into Ubi-Collect-a-Thon No.X. It work fine, most Ubi-games do, but what makes this one special? I am willing to praise the variety of ways missions can occasionally be solved and the involved multiplayer component is downright fascinating. What can't get my blessing are the story and characters. This is basically Lizard Squad "The Video-Game" and a Best Memes of 2015/16 collection. A rarely skip cutscenes but I ended up being physically incapable of watch this rubbish. The tone is quite broken too. The game is about these oh so "diverse" 20-something hackers and their PC Culture enforcement adventures but multiple trophies demand to kill, despite most enemies being simple security guards. The protagonist even carries a gun on the cover and his stealth attacks only kills too. Again, nothing makes sense and diversity ain 't a checkbox dear developers. I myself am half black and the well done San Francisco setting is appropriately chosen but I abide no pandering, which this 100% is. I ultimately finished the campaign, these Ubi-games tend to work well after all, but the devs need to go back to the drawing board. They made 2 steps forward and 4 steps back. 7,5/10;7/10;13 April 2017;10 out of 15 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Not worth it;To be fair i only played for maybe 4 hours. So maybe its getting better later in the game. But its really just the same stuff over and over again. Gameplay is like in the first game. So far so good. But even the first game was very repetitive. You walk around and hack NPC phones and pretty much anything that has ctOS installed. You follow the instructions of your mission to hack something and then you do it again for hours. And its not really fun. The characters are not interesting. Storywise there is not much going on so far. Very early you get a mission to steal 10M! You dontate that money, sounds fine... but why not fund your "operation"? I still have to steal little sums by phone from normal people to buy stuff? Also i'm supposed to be a hacker. But i have a gun! I can pretty much shoot every NPC and go through all levels no problem. So you are actually just a villain who thinks he is above the law? I think a lot is wrong with the game in this form. Overall it doesn't pull me into the game and there are so many other better games out there so don't worry if you skip that one.;5/10;1 April 2023;2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;A sequel with improvements and flaws;Watch Dogs 2 decides to go far a more light hearted and humorous route rather than the dark tone of the first game. Most of the time I would be fine with this if the humour in the game wasn't so bad. Most of the jokes fall flat and the characters seem to be forgettable excluding Wrench. The game has many improvements over the first. The Driving for one is greatly improved and hacking has much more importance unlike the first WD. Though due to Watch Dogs 2 being an online game even when playing single player has its problems. Due to this, slow mo shooting has been completely taken out. This was a pretty essential gameplay feature that was very fun to use in the 1st WD. Watch Dogs 2 seems to be a downgrade in gunplay which is sort of a problem but at the same time not, as watch Dogs 2 makes u rely more on hacking then shooting but it's still an obvious downgrade. I have a problem with the story line as the characters will kill countless innocent people/guards for their cause which is not major enough to excuse their actions. In the game you'll go from murdering 20 innocent guards at a corporate office to making jokes and laughing with your buddies in the next cutscene. It just doesn't work for me. Depends on how much you care for stories in games. But if you play games solely for the gameplay aspect this probably won't bother you.;6/10;29 April 2019;4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Incredible but the story is kind of bad;B tier, 7/10. I hate dead sec and their edgy hacker theme. They are memorable but definitely are really over the top and trying to be edgy. The main character isn't that Interesting or memerable either, I don't even remember his name. The story was really basic and just a typical bad big business guy.Despite these major flaws I stole enjoyed the game. The shear over the top chaos you can cause by hacking is really fun. You can get the police to arrest strangers, blow up has vents, control cars, controll a drone and all kinds of robotic equipment I remember simply modifying the traffic lights to cause chaos.Just experimenting with this stuff is really fun. The world of San Francisco in the game is really detailed, It looks incredible and just exploring it was enjoyable to me. I love the sightseeing things where you had to take a photo of a landmark.The customisation is very limited, with clothes feeling like they were very pre set, some outfits looked really cool and the suits were great, I just wish you could have more freedom in choosing what you wear. I distinctly remember the guns in this game being really realistic, shooting a civilian felt awful, a bit to realistic. The customisation for them was just ok but the noise and how everyone reacts to them was shockingly real.Honestly I really did enjoy the game, despite a weak story I found it really fun. Just messing around and exploring the city was great. The story was basic but was serviceable and I didn't mind completing it to unlock more things. One of the first games I got on PS4 and I just think it gets a bad rep.

Ubisoft;For Honor;I wish I could give this 1 star a 100 times;While the idea was nice, this game is fundamentally unfair. Half the game is loaded with cheaters and they get away with it. A game only doesn't count as a loss if you leave if all your teammates left, while it's a guaranteed loss after 2 leave (and even more definite if opponents cheat). Ubisoft should REALLY get on top of this cheating problem, it ruins the game, which already had a super toxic fanbase to begin with. The characters and rules for revenge are incredibly unbalanced and thus unfair. If playing this game fills you with rage and gives you high blood pressure, bless your heart.

Ubisoft;For Honor;Good Game, still has its problems;I have been playing For honor since the open beta. after that point it has consistently been one of my favorite games of the year. The main reason why it is so fun to play is the fact that is so rewarding to do well in online matches. There is a great amount of customization with many colors, Paint types, and ornaments. tough the game requires a learning curb it is really amusing to play and with friends the game is amazing. I firmly believe that this is a great game for people who like fighting games due to the combos and chains. there are three main factions to choose from The Knights of Ashfeld, The Vikings of Valkenheim, and the Samurai of The Myre. one major problem with the game is balance. many characters aren't as strong as others, however it is my belief that ever character can kill any other character.;8/10;27 February 2018;4 out of 6 found this helpful.

You either invest a frustrating few months into this game to get all the millisecond reactions and reads, or act like a punching bag to toxic emote spamming kids 7. Did I mention light spam?Conclusion: Find something less frustrating and more rewarding to do.;2/10;10 September 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;For Honor;Fails in all aspects;Probably the worst title I have laid my hands on. From recurring bugs and just plain balancing issues this title has everything to show you that it simply isn't worth your time. The developers have obviously jumped ship quite a while ago to work on other way more successful titles such as Assassins Creed etc. And the remaining few that stuck it out have so little game knowledge that they destroy the game unintentionally. Heros whos sole purpose it is just to annoy you is the norm and the entire games premise of "fighting for honor" becomes quite ironic considering how toxic the entire environment is. I would usually critique the players who "destroy" the fun but in this case it is the game which is entirely designed to be annoying and infuriating.;1/10;22 May 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;For Honor;11+;This game is very mild for a title with the "M" rating. Sure, it has blood, but it can be turned off. The main concern to parents are the assassinations. Although they are optional, they can be pretty intense. One features a samurai decapitating they opponent. Keep in mind though, that you have to be trying during the fight to get an assassination. If your kid plays Sky rim, Dark Souls, or any first person shooter, than this should be fine. In the campaign, there is problem solving and no objectives located on the map, so you have to figure this out yourself. The multiplayer is more strategy than problem solving. Over all I think this game is for fairly mature 11 year old people and up.;9/10;14 February 2017;4 out of 9 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;For Honor;Okay for 11 year olds to play;The game is rated m for mature but I would say is okay do eleven and up. There is executions but they don't depict very much. There is also not a lot of blood. I have watch my son play the game and I actually think it is an awesome game. The game is just wonderful and delightful. It is no worse then the knife combat in battle field one.;10/10;25 February 2017;4 out of 10 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;For Honor;Greatest video game yet;I like everything great content, events, heroes, seasons, maps, user interface & gameplay.The hero customisation exceptionally.You can get nearly everything with steel. (Except. Marching fire, steel packs & the battle pass) Everything else is available for free, if you put in the time and effort by playing the game.I highly recommend For Honor it's a very good experience. Have fun on your journey warrior!;10/10;25 October 2021;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
