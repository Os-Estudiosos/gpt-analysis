Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game!;Really enjoyed playing AC Odyssey! If not for the fun of playing a great game but it's also feel good to just roam in the beautiful Mediterranean setting!;9/10;31 December 2020;11 out of 12 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Good gameplay, awful story.;It's enjoyable to play ACO if you will ignore story and especially dialogs. Amazing level design, good gameplay, nice graphics, not bad voices. But man, that story so flat, it sucked almost like Justice league. And the dialog even more, absolutely horrible and very poorly written. The idea with cultist very good. And dialogs and choices are horrible and useless. Too many historical persons with flat personality, would be better to have one two but more interesting and deeper character.;7/10;26 June 2019;34 out of 57 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Beautiful game with the storytelling of a 4-year old;Well-designed game, but the dialogues and story arc make you wish it was over sooner rather than later. Nothing is missed by skipping them.;7/10;19 April 2020;26 out of 43 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;This Game Is Everything and More;I am not a pro gamer, nor do I play video games on a regular basis but I could not help but appreciate all the hard work and care the developers and actors of AC: Odyssey put into this creation. For someone who had been enjoying reading about Ancient Greece and all the myths and legends surrounding that period, this game delivers an unforgettable immersive experience. I am grateful to everyone at Ubisoft who helped bring (in my case) Alexios's story to life. I loved every minute of 200+ hours I spent playing the game and its DLCs to the point that I did not want it to end. The ease of movements, engaging weapon and gear system, cool abilities, gorgeous locations, truly all-climbable obstacles and the seamless interconnectivity of it all throughout the progression of the game deserve the utmost recognition. I am grateful for all the choices I was given a chance to make, for the moments of awe, laughter and tears I have experienced. Keep up the great work, Ubisoft Quebec!;10/10;6 February 2021;19 out of 22 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;8 hours in, haven't gotten bored once.;I haven't played an Assassins Creed game since Black Flag, so I saw Odyssey was on sale for cheap and decided to get it. It hasn't let me down once. I love the story, it's easy to keep track of and lets you explore the open world between tasks, building up the in game world just that much more. The combat system is nicely done, if you get down the timing on dodging or blocking then you should have no problem with most of the enemy's. It never forces you into a difficulty and you can turn it higher or lower whenever you like. Happy playing!;10/10;9 December 2020;12 out of 16 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;What happened?;This game is a masterpiece, massively awesome. Less than a month ago, this game had a 9.1 rating on this site, now it has an 8.3, what happened? Did Red Dead fans want to hate on it because they didn't win Game if the year? Or people just hating on it?;10/10;16 December 2018;67 out of 121 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Awesome;What an awesome and amazing game! Massive open world with no end of exploring and interactions. Great game design and attention to detail. And when you set game difficulty to hard they deliver. And the mercs are a great challenge and very rewarding when defeated. Now one of my favs. Strongly recommended.;10/10;16 December 2018;30 out of 50 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Perfect;No complaints game was better than expected. Story was entertaining, gameplay was fun, and game was long which i enjoyed.;10/10;8 October 2021;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game;Great story line and game play. You almost forget that you're playing Assassins Creed, it' more of an adventure quest (depending on the mode you pick) from start to finish. The fighting style is smoother than the last and the abilities list is very dynamic to fit your fighting style. This is the number one game of the year as of right now. Red Dead Redemption has it's hands full.;10/10;5 October 2018;47 out of 91 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Good game;I enjoyed the gameplay and the world is vast and pretty. The soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are nice. However, the story and characters lack development, voice acting and animations were bad compared to Origins and other AC game and the ending was disappointing.;6/10;11 April 2019;15 out of 32 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Back to its best.;Assassin's creed odyssey is the assertion and the reformation of a stale franchise, that in the break of a year and a release later, stands as one of the best RPG's out there and certainty rivalling assassin's creed 2 in this particular franchise.From the stunning world, to the brilliant combat, to the incredible performance of Kassandra, this game is one of the best of the generation (certainly top 10). Ubisoft have really revitalised a franchise that was on the verge of collapse. Assassin's creed odyssey is stunning. The games fundamentals and basic elements far exceed that of any other assassin's creed game. The performance of Melissa Mahut as Kassandra is incredible as she manages to nail so many different emotions and feelings the character may feel through the awesome new choices made throughout and does it in some style, hence her being nominated at the game awards for it. Ancient Greece is one of the best looking worlds I've ever seen with incredible amounts of detail as ubisoft continued this after the wonderful world of Origins (Egypt). The Gameplay is fun and keeps you changing up styles frequently, a thing that many games struggle with. The choices aid this also as you never know how the game will come back at you, if you lie, romance or kill someone.All in all this game is one of the best and ignore that moron that complains that it isn't assassin's creed anymore. This is the best assassin's creed has ever been (except 2). Ubisoft have really outdone themselves and despite the 50-80 hours of play through this game is not to be missed. I encourage anyone that hasn't, to buy this game. This truly is one of the best this generation.;10/10;13 June 2019;19 out of 34 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Overwhelming.;Too big. As soon as started I'm having so much overwhelming missions thrown my way half of which mean nothing just an excuse to get xp up.Sync points.No a lot of quick travel points for something so big.Dead eyes. Once again assasins creed characters have no emotions In their face it's like talking to someone when both eyes are lazy.(I don't who their talking too)Making choices through dialogue. Nothing you decide really has that much of an affect they don't even have a karma metre to judge weather you've done good things or not.Overall graphics are pretty, the sword play is average and the story is predictable.;6/10;21 July 2019;10 out of 26 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;As large as an ocean but as deep as a puddle;Quality>quantity, for such a big game,it surely disappointed, its just copy and paste over and over, no originality or uniqueness;1/10;5 June 2020;23 out of 42 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Positively excellent;Graphics, everything looks stunning. Story starts off slow but it does pick up. Massive map to explore with plenty to do.;10/10;3 March 2019;18 out of 34 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game play and combat, weak story and characters;Okay let me start this review with it is AMAZING. I, personally chose Alexios for my first play through but playing it for a second time I chose what I think is the better option, Kassandra. So far I've played about 20 hours with Kassandra and 150 with Alexios and this game is pure gold. The game play was flowed with action, (I like to use the bows) whether your using a sword, ax, or bow its so much fun. There are no glitches I've come across so far but I must say that in the beginning, I hated the game. I picked it up at gamestop and said hey lets give it a go but It just didn't seem that great. But I thought this game has good reviews so lets play some more. That was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. Personally, I don't enjoy Assassin's Creed games to much. I played Origins, It blew me a way so I knew I HAD to try Odyssey out, I also played Unity which I thought was great and its graphics were way ahead for a 2014 game, but this game felt different. It didn't feel like an Assassin's Creed game, which maybe was the reason I liked it so much and that's the reason why maybe some don't like it as much. It still focuses on game play which is good, but I feel it has a weak story. There good characters and all, but It seems that the side characters have more depth and the developers put more thought into them like Myrrine, than the main protagonist themselves. For the full experience I think you should chose Kassandra because of the dialogue and just overall more natural character, but if you chose Alexios, be my guest because he's just as good. Overall Odyssey is great game with great graphics and content, but has a weak story and characters that just ruin the experience.;10/10;2 February 2022;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Great game, but short from being perfect;Greetings from Lithuania.So after finishing all the DLC's for the game as well as main game and platinum it, i can safely say that "Assassin's Creed Odyssey" (2018) is a really great game, overall. More then a few times during my first 50 hours of game play (it took me eventually almost 125 hours to do it fully, but without rushing it), i stopped and simply looked around and was amazed of how amazingly the game simply looks. The graphics are out of this world beautiful. The world itself looks amazing and feels amazing. Colors are gorgeous. Combat system was very good for me personally. I liked the main story and found it interesting. The open world side quests were hit and miss because there really interesting ones and very boring ones. Exploration was another thing that i enjoyed it very much. But then when DLC came, they were pretty boring for me personally, and all i wanted is just to finish the game and move forward.Overall, i really enjoyed "Assassin's Creed Odyssey". I will be looking forward for next installments. Its not perfect, but its a damn great stuff.;9/10;27 August 2019;11 out of 20 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Quite possibly the best Assassin's Creed game since Part 2;I got this game when it was on sale along with another Ubisoft game, For Honor. After playing the first level, which is kinda like Dynasty Warriors before you enter the main game and exploring the island as a man or woman, it gets interesting. The graphics sound and controls are pretty good despite having frame rate being the same speed as other games of this generation like Red Dead which is still the best game of last year. Like most Ubisoft games, it has Uplay as well as the Ubisoft Club rewards program and you'll get lots of achievements too as you progress through the game. Highly recommended if you love history and stealth.;10/10;19 May 2019;11 out of 21 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;Amazing Game;Wow.. this game was incredible! From combat to climbing to overall story. This game accomplished all of it. The players choice between alexios and kassandra is a great aspect of the game where most games don't give the player the option to pick which story you want to pursue(after playing I highly suggest playing as kassandra). I won't bore you too much but I absolutely loved this game and would highly suggest for others to play it.;10/10;30 March 2020;9 out of 17 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Assassin's Creed Odyssey;One of the best words ever.;Out of all the Assasins creed games this is the most unfairly hated on. It has an unbelievably detailed and vibrant world that you can explore for hours. The gameplay is pretty good and some side quests are fantastic. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone but it does come with several issues. First of all the story is extremely forgettable, it's not bad but I can't even remember everything that happens. Another problem which in my opinion is the biggest is the pacing. The game forces you to do side quests to level up and it kills any sense of forward movement in the story. Honestly if you just removed the story and just had a ton of side missions I might have liked it better. The game overall though is over-hated and just because you don't play as an assassin by title doesn't mean the whole game is garbage.;7/10;20 February 2024;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;It keeps getting bigger and better.;Rainbow six siege is a tactical and methodical first person shooter developed by Ubisoft. Currently 1.6 million people play this game everyday, and it's vastly growing. As you first enter the game, you will feel the urge to rush into a heavily barricaded room and kill everyone to feel like a bad ass. Although this may sound fun, this is no call of duty. This game requires communication between teammates, searching for you enemy and having the will to be patient. You must be patient. For anyone who has ever played overwatch, this game will feel slightly similar with it's 'operator' system. Meaning each playable character has their own unique ability, varying from toxic smoke grenades to a stim pistol that can revive your teammates. You may play as an attacker or defender, on attack you must use your drones to locate either a hostage, a bomb or a bio-hazard container. Once the objective is located you must plan an attack to infiltrate the building and secure one of these three unique modes. On defense, well you guessed it, you have to defend. This means scouting the area on cameras, planting booby traps and reinforcing walls to stop the attackers from breaching in easily. But siege provides something more than just shooting and searching. It creates a large intense atmosphere that no game I have played has ever managed to capture before. It uses gritty and realistic game play mechanics to really make the player feel as if they are breaching a building. Once you're dead, you're dead, you can't respawn until the nest round, this may be off putting to some, but this means more communicating and tactical teamwork. I have had rainbow for a few months now, and haven't got bored once. This game is a definitely must buy and is totally different to anything I've played before. Pick this game up next time you have the chance, you won't regret it.;8/10;25 September 2016;8 out of 10 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Ubisoft did a GOOD?!;This is a great multiplayer game, I come back to it every couple of months for a couple of months because of how good it is. It's one of the most tactical games I've ever played which means you have to not be an absolute dough ball when playing the game, you have to strategies and work well with your team mates to win which can create feuds very quickly between players and makes the game extremely sweaty. The operators each having unique abilities also adds a lot to the game, you have to gain not be a complete dough ball and pick the right character for a given situation. Overall for a game that is constantly on deals to lower the price,mot is worth a cheeky purchase. One thing I will say and that I have noticed with some of my friends is that new players struggle a lot, it is a difficult game to start but if you keep playing it is satisfying and it can be enjoyed.;7/10;19 February 2021;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Really good multiplayer tactical shooter;I've play this game since 2016 operation health and i enjoy this game so much. This is not a game that encourage you to run and gun like a superhero, this game encourage you to be tactical. Played with my friends thinking about a good strategy to defeat the opposing team, though laugh at time when doing something stupid. The monetization is okay for me because almost everything is unlock if you play the game and not forced to buy anything because all items is just outfits for your operator. But the game drawback for me is the connection to the server is quite bad, at times suddenly disconnect from match for no reason and the sound bug is annoying me. I recommend this game if you're like tactical shooters.;9/10;1 October 2020;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Rainbow Six Siege is the greatest Home Alone simulator;After reaching level 99 in this game I can say it is the peak of Ubisoft Shooters. Fast paced, heart pounding and break-neck moments are what make up most of Six Siege. Mastering the operators, the maps and the mechanics are what make this a stand out game. It's almost a puzzle game, finding a hole in the defence with the right operator for the right situation. Each operator has their niche, be it Thermite at making an entrance or Montagne with his supporting capabilities. They all have their place in a match and learning that is key. The thrill of mastering Pulse, stalking the hallways of the map using cover to hide and then, when they least expect it, flanking them with a semi-automatic shotgun is the highlight of my time with this game. This game has made me enjoy Ubisoft once again, which is quite an accomplishment considering the disappointment of Watch_Dogs.;10/10;28 April 2016;11 out of 14 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Amazing and brilliant;This game is so good not just because it's a fun shooter but it's also very tactical you have to actually think you can't just go guns blazing all the time it's probably my favorite game of 2017-2018;10/10;11 March 2018;6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Best FPS if I do say so my self. Way to go Ubisoft;I love this game so much. The amount of tactics put into this game and all the other stuff like breaking walls, shooting through them. And how much your aim matters is just awesome. So many operators and surely more to come.;10/10;31 October 2019;3 out of 4 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;A great potential ruined by toxic community and bad PC gamepad controls;After having played so many Call of Duty games, CS:GO and Team Fortress 2, this game feels like a step back, especially when you play it with a controller in which case the aiming is almost impossible. It feels like it has really clunky controls. The aiming is very hard with players like Clash and Montagne. We cannot pick up the weapons dropped by dead enemies (this made sense in Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch since they are class-based characters but there's no reason here). There are a lot of smurf accounts that abuse us for not playing on their level (even though we are in the Newcomers level), and there is no way to report such players.In terms of visual appeal this game is great. There are also a large number of maps to choose from, which makes this game look like it had a lot more potential. There are also plenty of characters to choose from. Though it lacks a campaign mode, it makes up for it with Challenges (which are also very difficult for new players). So overall I'd say it's a gorgeous looking game ruined by its bad controls and community.;6/10;24 March 2021;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;AMAZING GAME !!!;Its Better than Fortnite!Way more action based and way more fun playstyle then battle royal games like fortnite;10/10;28 October 2018;5 out of 9 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Was fun at the start but the novelty starts to wear thin.;I liked the Rainbow Six novel, and I thoroughly enjoyed the original Rainbow Six games, particularly the very first game released in 1998 and on of my favourite games of all time Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield (2003). The best thing about it was the playability of the single player campaign, which Rainbow Six: Siege sorely lacks, instead has a huge emphasis on multiplayer following in the footsteps of such games as Call of Duty and Battlefield.Although Rainbow Six: Siege is what you make of it, I find the game to be mostly repetitive and multiplayer missions is a different experience. If you fail the mission or don't perform up to standard you can expect a backlash from other players online. The game has its moments but it's hardly addictive gameplay.As a Rainbow Six fan, it is such a shame considering I was eagerly looking forward to a new Rainbow Six game. If Rainbow Six sticks with what previously attracted many players to the game I would consider staying faithful to the series, but seeing as I feel that Rainbow Six: Siege felt like a average experience, I am not so sure.Unless you enjoy strategic multiplayer games you may enjoy it, otherwise if you are a fan of shoot em up games you won't get much enjoyment out of it.6/10.;6/10;11 December 2015;6 out of 23 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Simple, but Great and Highly Re-Playable;In just one sentence: Rainbow Six: Siege is a great shooter that is a lot of fun to play.There isn't really much of a story. There are terrorists and different CTUs from around the world need to stop them. So, don't go in expecting a story. As there really isn't one.The graphics for the game are quite good and passable for a late 2015 game. The weapons look sleek and well designed. The sounds they make are incredible.The gameplay is where Siege shines. Simple, but intense, every moment mattering games that change every round. Each round, a group of attackers seek out the defenders and try to eliminate them. The defenders have time to prepare by setting up reinforced walls, dropping body armor for your teammates, and placing trip mines. Every second that goes by matters, and any second something can happen. Ranging from a drone entering a room to mark players, to a wall exploding, to a flash bang going off and blinding everyone, to a bullet coming through a window and killing your teammate. This is before getting into how important sound is. Listening to your surroundings can save your life and help you achieve victory.If you are looking for a shooter that will keep you playing for weeks and even months, Rainbow Six: Siege is the game for you!;10/10;14 May 2016;3 out of 5 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;A bare bones SWAT with great mechanics;I don't mind the exclusion of a campaign, even if these are what the series is known for, but it is still unfortunate due to the quality of the sole such co-op mission after the string of alibi tutorials. The sequel will certainly have one and this sub-series should be renamed to S.W.A.T. due to the similar nature of this game to that dead franchise. The multiplayer mode is pretty fascinating and the unique gameplay is rock solid but the lack of content and customization is noticeable. The game thus feels somewhat uncompleted for a full price game yet i will come back for the sequel and will stick around longer if it will feature more content. 7,5/10;7/10;15 April 2016;2 out of 7 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Ending the journey that started with Velvet Shell;When I first played Siege, I admired the Ubisoft's take on modern tactical combat, which was like the SWAT games, it was also one of the best perks of Siege. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, two major problems have been already slowly growing. Community and money.When Ubisoft went to the sci-fi world and added futuristic gadgets and powers for the operators, it was a matter of time when the game would lose its perk of great realistic tactical combat and turn into another new Black Ops game. With constant map changes and new flashy skins, I couldn't recognize the Siege I was playing. You don't need to regularly release new maps and ops, just work on the ops you already have and optimize the gameplay towards balance. Releasing new stuff won't fix the problems.Community has gotten bigger and surely it brought new ways to make the game more unenjoyable. Cheaters are roaming through the servers without instant consequences, it takes days and months to finally ban them but that would be already too late for the damages they caused. Intentional teamkill is still not fixed properly and it's even worse when you meet a bad group of teammates.A company hungry for money but not happiness of players. They would rather release new 50 sets of cosmetic items than fixing a single problem.;4/10;26 August 2021;5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Very addictive;I love this game, it's a fantastic online game with so many operators and weapons to choose from, it's definitely one of the best online tactical multiplayer games ever made. My only downfall to this game is the online servers, my connection is very good to play this game but it always disconnects me to play it and I have to keep restarting the game to get it connected. If the servers where a bit better I would have definitely have given this game a 10/10, but besides the server issue I still think it's an amazing game I would recommend people to try it out.;6/10;12 August 2021;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Great but coulda been perfect;Back in the day this around I'd say season 1-12 this game was a 9.7/10 but with all the new updates and toxic community the game got worse and worse every season sadly. Though, this game is a great fps shooter, personally my favorite of all time, they have good dlcs, great characters which you can choose from like 60 of them maybe even more.

Ubisoft;Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege;Unlimited Potential, Limited Developers.;Rainbow Six: Siege is a first person shooter unlike any other. With gunplay that is innovative, responsive, tactical, and most importantly, unique. Siege offers gameplay on quite literally every dimension, from the floorboards to the skylight on top of a bank. Everything in this game is able to be modified by the player. Cosmetics are slightly limited to a paywall, yet you can still customize each operator to your personal liking over time. Every attachment changes how each gun feels, and it almost never gets boring using the same gun. Speaking of never getting boring, each kill feels satisfying, as if you look the other player in the eye and assert that you are the better player on each kill. Nothing in Rainbow Six: Siege gets stale, and the 5 on 5 bomb defusing style has never been adapted better. Siege is a clear sign of innovation in a genre that had seemingly been ran dry.;7/10;12 April 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Amazing Villain;An amazing game with various mechanics,a good progression system and amazing story with well written villains especially Joseph Seed. With beautiful graphics and its first person Open World it really immerses you in the gameplay.;9/10;12 October 2021;16 out of 16 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Tons of Choas and an Interesting Characters Trade Off for a Thin Plot and a Disappointing Ending;The concept of Far Cry 5 was the primary reason I picked up Far Cry 5 but a friend of mine recommended highly as well. I wasn't familiar with the Far Cry series but having played Far Cry 5, I loved the open world mechanics of it. I think it stacks up to the best in the genre (Rockstar's titles, Ubisoft's other franchises etc.). There's a chaotic nature to it that's a lot fun and there's always something going on. This is true of other open-world games, but I also loved the setting. Setting it in Montana, the lush forests and American Midwest setting offer a lot of unique wildlife and creative environments to travel through. It added to a different feel than other sandbox games I've played.The plot of Far Cry 5 is best looked at one of two ways. The plot has a good setup, you're trying to dismantle the cult piece by piece (even if you have to ignore the plot hole that your character should be high-tailing it out of the state for help the first chance he/she gets) and take care of the villainous Joseph Seed and his lieutenants John, Jacob and Faith. You get the choice of which area to go to (its divided into 5 areas, each of the lieutenants controls a portion of the map then Dutch's island and the actual compound for Eden's Gate cult) and the game plays out in the same way no matter where you go. Other than taking these people out and saving your friends, there is no progression until you hit the ending conflict. This is too bad, but I think the game compensates by giving you interesting friends (my favourites being Cheesburger the bear, Peaches the cougar and Boomer the dog) and interesting villains. John, Jacob and Faith are all vile in different ways but they all suffered from various forms of abuse and Joseph preyed on that to indoctrinate them into his twisted way of thinking. You fight them, but I did find that I could either relate to them or sympathize with them even if it was just for fleeting moments. Joseph is a monster, but he was formed to be that as opposed to just being born that way. This is a trade off, but it was more than enough to keep me going.The reactions to Far Cry 5 have been mixed and while some of that can be chalked up to the "politically" charged nature of it, I have to agree that the criticism of the ending is valid. The game offers 2 endings depending on a final choice (there's also a hidden ending that you can get at the beginning) and I picked the "true" ending. They leave you some bread crumbs to hint at it if you're listening to the radio, but I found it to be such a shock. I thought about it for a while and I do like the dark nature of it, but it doesn't seem to fit the rest of the game. It nullifies most of the story and while it didn't wreck the total experience, I didn't enjoy it and I agree with the negative reviews on this point. My final reaction was: "Did they really think this was the best way to end it?"This is one of those games that comes down to a simple calculation for me. The pros outweigh the cons by a decent margin, even if it wasn't everything I wanted it to be. As someone who hadn't played any of the previous Far Cry games, this was fairly easy to pick up, it played in a different environment and gave me interesting friends and foes to bounce off of. The variation in the missions helped keep things fresh and I liked how I could do anything I wanted at any time. The trade off for the characters is that there isn't much progression in the plot and while I thought the ending is unique and very dark, it didn't work for me and I felt like I got sucker punched by it. I would still recommend this game, I'm going to be playing it again and while it wasn't the whole package, I'd grade it at around an 8.5/10. I'm rounding down because of the sour note it ended on.;8/10;30 May 2018;17 out of 22 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Wow;I'm still playing the campaign, but so far this game is breathtaking. The darkest Far Cry out of all of them. It's very disturbing and it will give chills by the opening introduction. This game is a winner.;9/10;28 March 2018;30 out of 50 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Yep;Five years down the road , and it's still a very good and fun game to play.I had my doubts at first, but with gamepass on the XboxX we all can play this nice game .Graphics hold up very well, after 5 years in the market it still looks very nice.Voices are pretty good, some funny comments as well.Characters are great, water looks like water, nice done.Big open world with a lot of things do, secret doors, hidden chests etc I like it.What wasn't that good is the Ai, sometimes the enemies run by or don't know what to do.Also a few bugs, at some point I couldn't open the door, you have to do it all over again at the last savepoint.But overall a great game, worth your time and money.;8/10;5 May 2023;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Epic!;This is a great, deep and dark story with awesome voice acting! The Father character is ingeniously created.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Great game but if you are religious I strongly suggest avoiding it;Yes if you do happen to be religious this game may hit a little too close to home or even offend you but boy I gotta say I'm having so much fun with it, I may be playing as someone who's going on a full blown rampage but that just adds to the thrill, the action is the best part and if you do happen to like open-world games or first person shooters I highly recommend checking this one out. A rather disturbing story behind it too and funny enough this has better graphics than 6 but I have a feeling that 6 was meant to look more arcadey compared to this. Nonetheless the Far Cry games are great, this one though has to be my personal favorite.;10/10;12 September 2022;4 out of 5 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;By the dawn's early light.;'Far Cry 5 (2018)' marks the first time that a game in the series has been set in the USA. As such, it has come under fire for its politics. However, the game isn't saying anything particularly controversial. whatever political musings there may be, they're entirely perfunctory. The story puts you in the shoes of a rookie police officer tasked with bringing in the leader of a notorious local cult. When all hell breaks loose, you must rally your allies and, essentially, enforce a form of home-grown martial law to bring things back to the way they used to be. The narrative is delivered in a less straightforward way this time around, with the majority of the game taking place within three distinct districts that can be played in any order. The occasional cut-scene will move things along without you having any input, but for the most part you are in control of the story's progression. This incidental kind of vibe is appropriate for the game-loop, as it allows you to undertake your own mini adventures while you progress towards the greater overall goal. That goal is, as usual, to reclaim the map. This time, though, there are no towers to climb. Instead, the world simply reveals itself as you move through it, meeting all manner of quirky character and delirious foe as you go. The map is chock full of content, most of which is driven by specific characters and, therefore, feels more important than the busywork it actually is. The 'buddy' system does a great job of making you feel like you're really having an impact. when you save certain people, they become available as AI co-op partners. Though the thing has a good sense of progression, the actual plot is segmented and ultimately unfulfilling - thanks, in no small part, to a cheap, supposedly 'clever' rug-pull of an ending. The sections which remove your control are clearly the worst parts of the entire affair, feeling frustrating and jarring, to boot. It takes a while to for the game to get into its own groove, but once it does it's an entertaining time. It feels like a slight step down for the franchise, but it's an enjoyable open-world experience nevertheless. 7/10;7/10;27 March 2020;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Great gameplay, awful story.;The game is a blast to play. Exploring the wilderness and taking outposts with your followers is insane fun. You can have a pilot bomb your enemies from above, a sniper take them out from a nice vantage point, or have them all slapped to death by a diabetic grizzly. The worst part of the game is the story and having to listen to any of the main characters talk about their "deep dark philosophical principal" The ending is absolute trash writing.;7/10;7 May 2018;32 out of 50 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Amazing story with beautiful gameplay;Has a compelling story that keeps you sucked into the game from the jaw dropping start to the insane ending.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Cutscene Incompetence;Let me introduce you to the plot device cutscene incompetence.The Protagonist is amazing. They can defeat hordes of monsters, perform feats of superhuman strength, solve complex puzzles no one else can, answer the most baffling riddles, and is always just in time for the action... that is, as long as they are being controlled by the player.Once a cutscene starts, or the player otherwise loses even the tiniest bit of control over their character, however, things tend to go south quick.That is Farcry 5 in a nutshell. Need to move the story on? Cue the mind control music into cutscene! Walking into a church to confront a big enemy? Cutscene and you're knocked out! Played for a few hours and enjoying yourself? Bliss cutscene!It's bad storytelling. You don't need to be forced into capture each time you want to progress the story with the main bad guys of the game. Such a bad trope, IN MY 2018? It's happening more than you would like to admit.Like all next-gen Farcry games, the best story ending is to stay still at the start of the game and let the credits roll.;6/10;14 October 2018;26 out of 44 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;As good as a video game can get.;The campaign is amazing and offers hours of addicting and thrilling gameplay. The story is gripping and there are so many amazing characters you meet throughout your adventures. Even without the amazing campaign the hundreds of things you can do in the open world also help solidify this game as an all time great. The villain is compelling the missions are extremely fun and the Guns for Hire system is a really good addition for the far cry series. The vehicle mechanics and controls are perfect. The game as stunning graphics and any console and the open landscape is simply beautiful.;10/10;26 September 2018;6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Mediocre game with some highlights.;Let's start with the positive things:Hope County is an interesting place to discover The AI companions are fun Joseph Seed is a good character conceptionally, as is the story of a cult taking control of almost everythingBut that is basically it. Everything else is either mediocre or annoyed me.Gameplay, weapons, travelling and collecting things are all fine, really. Nothing to complain about, but nothing special either.Things that were really bad were the amount of glitches. Some were minor and just an inconvenience like button prompts not being correct, mission markers not working properly, ammo not displayed correctly and such. Every now and then I had to restart the game though.But the thing that really makes this game less than a good game for me (which would be an 8 on my scale) is the horrible disconnect. The protagonist is mute and I am not allowed to react in any way to basically anything. Basically there are two actual story choices in the game, everything else boils down to play or not play (a mission, but the game as well of course). Worse and making me angry is the fact that the plot allows my character to be captured without any chance to avoid it. It happens a dozen times. For one story arc, I get it, although it still annoys me, for two others there is a certain explanation, which theoretically makes sense, but is still kinda flimsy and so very frustrating and lazy. It is basically a way to have the enemies getting away with their monologues. But even when you are the one in control they are allowed to spew their nonsense.It is a frustrating game, but if you buy it for around 30 bucks it may be worth it. I don't begrudge giving them my money, although the trajectory since FC3 is barely going upwards.;6/10;30 July 2019;7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;Still a Fun Game.. but..;I usually give the FC games a 10/10 (except for Primal - sorry, I gave up on that after about 2 hours). This one was seriously ambitious, with beautiful scenery and all the usual crazy violent stuff that makes a Far Cry game. However, I gotta take three points off for this one. Every game on this scale has glitches of course, but the AI in this (on single-player) is just plain stupid, especially when you have a partner (even worse with two) assigned to your squad. First, they don't shut up - and when there's two of them and you're piloting a vehicle (car, boat, plane, etc), the convo-glitch between them is in full effect - repeating the same lines over and over. Second, they'll see a "Peggi" (bad guy) or hostile animal seemingly long before the hostile indicator lights up on your HUD and go ballistic. Same issue happens when talking to a character that you're trying to get a mission from. They'll be talking to you and suddenly see a bear just grazing in the grass 500 yards away and go into "conflict" mode and start running around being stupid - or worse, they'll jump into the vehicle you drove/flew up in and disappear into the void - leaving you to go seek another mission, by foot. Third, you waste plenty of time trying to get the AI partner(s) to get into your vehicle with you, especially a helicopter. They'll stand there or run around in circles forever before suddenly clicking and running into the seat. Like I said, every game has glitches, but these particular ones slow the flow of the game and make it frustrating - like continuously having to get out of your vehicle and back in it before the AI realizes it's time to go. And whatever you do, don't let your AI partners fly anything you're in. You'll never be able to get back into the plane or helicopter once you get out of it. no matter how many times you instruct them to land. As soon as your feet hit the ground, they'll immediately take off and just hover above you and you're stuck walking.Another point mark down for the 20+ minute unskippable and barely playable intro (every few minutes or so, you might get to push a button or slowly walk around during the opening sequence). The story-line really isn't that deep to force you to have to sit that long through the intro. It's Far Cry man.. I get it.. bad bosses got armies of bad dudes doing bad things.. let's get to slaying!And finally a point mark down for those stupid "Capture Squad" sequences, especially the "bliss" ones when in the female boss' territory. As you continue to wreak havoc in a boss' territory, eventually the boss gets pissed and sends his whole army to not kill you, but capture you so you can do some drug-induced shoot-em-up sequence, only to let you go to do more damage to their sanctioned area. This makes no sense.. if the boss has this capability, why not just end you 10 seconds after you cross into their territory? I know, a 5-minute game wouldn't sell that well, but still.But on good notes, fun, funny, and over-the-top violent as usual, sans the boring fishing missions. It's worth your dime and I'm sure some DLCs are yet to come. The final boss showdown is not as climatic as the sequence that happens after you do prevail - once you are able to save four or five of your people, it's not that hard to get through, but what happens afterwards is eyebrow raising. But the story-telling, main missions, graphics, and weapon-play are the usual Far Cry fun-time madness.Two notes: Gone are the radio-tower climbs. After the intro, there's one mission to climb a radio tower which is needed to open the full map, but that's the only required climb. There's some side missions that involve radio tower climbs, but not necessary to further the story line. Weapon variety is good, but really no need to load up/spend on all of them. Once I was able to afford the .50 cal sniper rifle and the high-powered scope, silencer, and extended mag, I was pretty much set. Taking down outposts hidden on a hill or rock-top was a breeze with that thing. You will need a good machine gun or rocket launcher to take down planes attacking you from the sky.;7/10;26 April 2018;10 out of 20 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;Far Cry 5;The best antagonist I ever seen;Far Cry is known for its antagonist and Far Cry 5 has given the best villain you can hope.Joseph Seed! I can't appreciate much, he don't need to act he can make you fear with his words. The best villain you will ever see in the game.The storyline and graphics are good enough to make you lost in the game for hours.The only thing I would criticize that Far cry5 should have given some backstory some presence for the deputy, It just feels like we have no part in the game. Deputy is only a moving camera no interaction to the world. And similarly to other Joseph seed should have been given more time to fight against him, after defeating his 3 siblings we have to directly fight against him in small and easy battle.Overall the game is good enough but should have improved much giving more depth to its villain and the protagonist.;8/10;21 October 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Superb fun;Greetings from Lithuania.I loved "Watch Dogs" 2 (2016). That said, this game offered for me even more then i expected. And i did not expected very much knowing (but not playing) how disappointing 1st game was considering how hyped it was by Ubisoft by its fake trailers at E3 back in the day. "Watch Dogs" 2 is a superb open world game, aka GTA 5 style but with a twist - instead of gun blazing every mission you must relay on your hacking skills - sure you can also go gun blazing here as well, but its more fun to use environment to create distractions, traps, or even a gang wars (and i used a lot of those) to achieve your objective. There are also a tons of fun activities in this world. You can play co-op - which is very fun, but there isn't that much of variety in co-op. Dialog were clever and also funny - this game is funny and its approach is very lighthearted. Overall, "Watch Dogs 2" is a very fun game. It has great and involving open world with fun activities, good story and superb game play. Hacking itself was very creative and overall experience felt like a breath of fresh air. Highly fun and addictive game overall.;10/10;25 July 2018;16 out of 19 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Gameplay vs story;The 1st game had a slightly slugging first half but I ended up liking it a lot overall. The often ridiculed and deliberately unlikable Aiden Pearce and the near nihilistic story stood out to me. The game had an identity, plain and simple. I only need a bit more gameplay variety for a sequel and I certainly got that but at what cost! The admittedly more involved hacking is now suddenly Pipe Mania and the overall game fully transformed into Ubi-Collect-a-Thon No.X. It work fine, most Ubi-games do, but what makes this one special? I am willing to praise the variety of ways missions can occasionally be solved and the involved multiplayer component is downright fascinating. What can't get my blessing are the story and characters. This is basically Lizard Squad "The Video-Game" and a Best Memes of 2015/16 collection. A rarely skip cutscenes but I ended up being physically incapable of watch this rubbish. The tone is quite broken too. The game is about these oh so "diverse" 20-something hackers and their PC Culture enforcement adventures but multiple trophies demand to kill, despite most enemies being simple security guards. The protagonist even carries a gun on the cover and his stealth attacks only kills too. Again, nothing makes sense and diversity ain 't a checkbox dear developers. I myself am half black and the well done San Francisco setting is appropriately chosen but I abide no pandering, which this 100% is. I ultimately finished the campaign, these Ubi-games tend to work well after all, but the devs need to go back to the drawing board. They made 2 steps forward and 4 steps back. 7,5/10;7/10;13 April 2017;10 out of 15 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Not worth it;To be fair i only played for maybe 4 hours. So maybe its getting better later in the game. But its really just the same stuff over and over again. Gameplay is like in the first game. So far so good. But even the first game was very repetitive. You walk around and hack NPC phones and pretty much anything that has ctOS installed. You follow the instructions of your mission to hack something and then you do it again for hours. And its not really fun. The characters are not interesting. Storywise there is not much going on so far. Very early you get a mission to steal 10M! You dontate that money, sounds fine... but why not fund your "operation"? I still have to steal little sums by phone from normal people to buy stuff? Also i'm supposed to be a hacker. But i have a gun! I can pretty much shoot every NPC and go through all levels no problem. So you are actually just a villain who thinks he is above the law? I think a lot is wrong with the game in this form. Overall it doesn't pull me into the game and there are so many other better games out there so don't worry if you skip that one.;5/10;1 April 2023;2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;A sequel with improvements and flaws;Watch Dogs 2 decides to go far a more light hearted and humorous route rather than the dark tone of the first game. Most of the time I would be fine with this if the humour in the game wasn't so bad. Most of the jokes fall flat and the characters seem to be forgettable excluding Wrench. The game has many improvements over the first. The Driving for one is greatly improved and hacking has much more importance unlike the first WD. Though due to Watch Dogs 2 being an online game even when playing single player has its problems. Due to this, slow mo shooting has been completely taken out. This was a pretty essential gameplay feature that was very fun to use in the 1st WD. Watch Dogs 2 seems to be a downgrade in gunplay which is sort of a problem but at the same time not, as watch Dogs 2 makes u rely more on hacking then shooting but it's still an obvious downgrade. I have a problem with the story line as the characters will kill countless innocent people/guards for their cause which is not major enough to excuse their actions. In the game you'll go from murdering 20 innocent guards at a corporate office to making jokes and laughing with your buddies in the next cutscene. It just doesn't work for me. Depends on how much you care for stories in games. But if you play games solely for the gameplay aspect this probably won't bother you.;6/10;29 April 2019;4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;Watch Dogs 2;Incredible but the story is kind of bad;B tier, 7/10. I hate dead sec and their edgy hacker theme. They are memorable but definitely are really over the top and trying to be edgy. The main character isn't that Interesting or memerable either, I don't even remember his name. The story was really basic and just a typical bad big business guy.Despite these major flaws I stole enjoyed the game. The shear over the top chaos you can cause by hacking is really fun. You can get the police to arrest strangers, blow up has vents, control cars, controll a drone and all kinds of robotic equipment I remember simply modifying the traffic lights to cause chaos.Just experimenting with this stuff is really fun. The world of San Francisco in the game is really detailed, It looks incredible and just exploring it was enjoyable to me. I love the sightseeing things where you had to take a photo of a landmark.The customisation is very limited, with clothes feeling like they were very pre set, some outfits looked really cool and the suits were great, I just wish you could have more freedom in choosing what you wear. I distinctly remember the guns in this game being really realistic, shooting a civilian felt awful, a bit to realistic. The customisation for them was just ok but the noise and how everyone reacts to them was shockingly real.Honestly I really did enjoy the game, despite a weak story I found it really fun. Just messing around and exploring the city was great. The story was basic but was serviceable and I didn't mind completing it to unlock more things. One of the first games I got on PS4 and I just think it gets a bad rep.

Ubisoft;For Honor;I wish I could give this 1 star a 100 times;While the idea was nice, this game is fundamentally unfair. Half the game is loaded with cheaters and they get away with it. A game only doesn't count as a loss if you leave if all your teammates left, while it's a guaranteed loss after 2 leave (and even more definite if opponents cheat). Ubisoft should REALLY get on top of this cheating problem, it ruins the game, which already had a super toxic fanbase to begin with. The characters and rules for revenge are incredibly unbalanced and thus unfair. If playing this game fills you with rage and gives you high blood pressure, bless your heart.

Ubisoft;For Honor;Good Game, still has its problems;I have been playing For honor since the open beta. after that point it has consistently been one of my favorite games of the year. The main reason why it is so fun to play is the fact that is so rewarding to do well in online matches. There is a great amount of customization with many colors, Paint types, and ornaments. tough the game requires a learning curb it is really amusing to play and with friends the game is amazing. I firmly believe that this is a great game for people who like fighting games due to the combos and chains. there are three main factions to choose from The Knights of Ashfeld, The Vikings of Valkenheim, and the Samurai of The Myre. one major problem with the game is balance. many characters aren't as strong as others, however it is my belief that ever character can kill any other character.;8/10;27 February 2018;4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Ubisoft;For Honor;Fails in all aspects;Probably the worst title I have laid my hands on. From recurring bugs and just plain balancing issues this title has everything to show you that it simply isn't worth your time. The developers have obviously jumped ship quite a while ago to work on other way more successful titles such as Assassins Creed etc. And the remaining few that stuck it out have so little game knowledge that they destroy the game unintentionally. Heros whos sole purpose it is just to annoy you is the norm and the entire games premise of "fighting for honor" becomes quite ironic considering how toxic the entire environment is. I would usually critique the players who "destroy" the fun but in this case it is the game which is entirely designed to be annoying and infuriating.;1/10;22 May 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;For Honor;11+;This game is very mild for a title with the "M" rating. Sure, it has blood, but it can be turned off. The main concern to parents are the assassinations. Although they are optional, they can be pretty intense. One features a samurai decapitating they opponent. Keep in mind though, that you have to be trying during the fight to get an assassination. If your kid plays Sky rim, Dark Souls, or any first person shooter, than this should be fine. In the campaign, there is problem solving and no objectives located on the map, so you have to figure this out yourself. The multiplayer is more strategy than problem solving. Over all I think this game is for fairly mature 11 year old people and up.;9/10;14 February 2017;4 out of 9 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;For Honor;Okay for 11 year olds to play;The game is rated m for mature but I would say is okay do eleven and up. There is executions but they don't depict very much. There is also not a lot of blood. I have watch my son play the game and I actually think it is an awesome game. The game is just wonderful and delightful. It is no worse then the knife combat in battle field one.;10/10;25 February 2017;4 out of 10 found this helpful.
Ubisoft;For Honor;Greatest video game yet;I like everything great content, events, heroes, seasons, maps, user interface & gameplay.The hero customisation exceptionally.You can get nearly everything with steel. (Except. Marching fire, steel packs & the battle pass) Everything else is available for free, if you put in the time and effort by playing the game.I highly recommend For Honor it's a very good experience. Have fun on your journey warrior!;10/10;25 October 2021;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;A Milestone in Gaming History;I have been playing video games for almost 20 years now. I have played games in every category imaginable and have had countless favorites over the years.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim surpasses all of these with flying colors.It is a giant play place. A beautifully crafted sandbox filled to the brim with HUNDREDS of hours of action, dialogue and epic quests. You will climb the highest mountains, crawl the deepest dungeons, wield the greatest weapons and fight the mightiest creatures.The game is gorgeous. It's landscapes, cities and towns are lush and vibrant with detail.Skyrim features professional voice acting talent by greats such as Michael Hogan, Joan Allen and Max von Sydow.Skyrim's main storyline is but a mere fraction of its content and you will easily find yourself enraptured in it's fantastical world. unable to break away as you pour your time into it almost unwillingly.It is simply marvelous. Words do not do it justice.;10/10;21 November 2011;115 out of 126 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Enter the World. And say goodbye to a real life.;Greetings from Lithuania.I'm writing this review, while meantime on the other PC i'm playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. WHAT a game! Can't remember the last time i was SO ADDICTED to a virtual game before. I'm playing for almost 80 hours already (!), and i'm not even in the middle of it yet! The graphics are gorgeous. Writing is top notch. But the game play, the open world, the hundreds of interesting quests, dungeons, dragons, bandits, magic, armors, castles, battles, wars, vampires, werewolves, mags, warriors, ... and so on and so on - it's just UNBELIEVABLE, how in the world creators have put all this stuff in one game! My favorite game before Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was "Fallout 3" but i thing it's time to say that i have a new king of games - SKYRIM. Buy it, play it, LIVE IT - because this is the game for the ages.Hands down, this a Milestone in Gaming History!;10/10;26 November 2011;87 out of 97 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;...a kind freedom that you cannot possibly experience in real life...;Long have I wanted to write a review for this game, but it's such a great game and it deserves such an in-depth review that I've been avoiding the task. Finally, I decided to write a review in two different aspects of the game. first what it represents as a video game and secondly its gameplay.Video games, in the past, had been something that were not taken seriously by the general public. Although some people still ridicule video games, they are now a new form of art and a giant industry. People who are not interested in video games will often tell you that ''it's not real'' and they'd rather experience something real. And I can relate to that. I'd rather have a ride on a real roller coaster than experiencing it on VR. But that doesn't apply to everything. It is really so much fun operating a battle tank in a video game, but you would s**t yourself in real life if you were in a tank and a shell hits your tank and makes a sound like a thunder! And reality comes with its limitations. There are no dragons in real life! And human body is so boringly fragile. Video games liberate us from these chains of reality. I remember reading a story in which there was this character who sits on a log or something in the wild and watches the scenery and wishes he was free from human needs like eating, sheltering, etc. So he could enjoy that scenery as long as he wanted. Video games do that, removes the limitations of reality so you can do whatever you want. If you are a non-gamer, think of games as dreams. While you are dreaming, it feels so real and intense, in fact, as far as the person who is dreaming is concerned, it is very much real at that moment. Then you wake up and you go on with your life. That's exactly how my relationship with games is. As long as you have your priorities straight and maintain a healthy balance, video games could be a most rewarding thing in your life and on some occasions, they may even make some improvements in your life! The only reason I can type this review in English right now is the video games. That's how I learned English, by playing games. I can clearly pinpoint some critical milestones in the past that have helped greatly advance my English. One of them was a meticulously detailed and thorough walkthrough of Fallout 2 which I had to refer to hundreds of times, obsessively, I'll admit. And the other one was reading unit descriptions in various games' wikis, as a sort of ASMR, the most notable of these was Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, I'd go to the wiki page and pick a unit from the 'complete unit list' and read about them. I digress, the point is video games are not that bad and they are about a kind freedom that you cannot possibly experience in real life...Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the pinnacle of the sort of freedom that I was talking about. Right at the very beginning of the game, like a doctor might put his patient under hypnosis just in a second, you awake in this new world. Aptly named and beautiful 'Awake' from the soundtrack starts playing, then you first hear horses walking and slowly open your eyes, you realize you are a prisoner being taken to somewhere. Soon, you create your character race and physical appearance and after a short series of scripted events, which also serve as the tutorial of the game, you emerge from a cave and you are amazed by the world in which you are now. Jeremy Soule's(composer) music is just perfect and I can't even describe it, I'm not eloquent enough, all I'll say about his music is that thousands of people, including myself, go to sleep every night, while still listening to this game's soundtrack, after all these years, even if not playing actively at the time. It's magical... You are now free to do any quest in the game, in any way you'd like, in any time you'd like and in any order you'd like. except the main quest line, you need to do those in their order, but even those give you a lot of freedom in terms of your pace and choices and they are independent from the many side quests of the game and they won't intercept or interrupt with each other and you can delay or pause and continue whenever you want. You can now slowly become a warrior or a mage or an assassin or something in between, and with enough time, you can be all of these things at the same time, while going from one place to another in one of the most beautiful open maps of any game. Really, you'll love this open world so much that you'll travel on foot most of the time, even though you have an option to fast-travel there, even more freedom... The open world is so detailed and full of surprises and easter eggs and stories that do not necessarily effect anything in the game, but they are just there to make the world more real and interesting. You'll come across a skeleton in some cave and there is a letter or journal next to it, so you can read his/her story. I don't want to put a spoiler warning on this review, so, I'll not talk about these things specifically, there are so many of them anyway, nor will I detail any of the quests. All you need to know is that you can slay dragons and only you can absorb their powers. And if games intimidate you because of how much other people are good at them, you are not in competition with anyone, do whatever you want on your own pace and difficulty setting, for example I turn the early game into hell by playing at the legendary difficulty from the very start, but you can start at 'easy' and you'll be a bully. Sorry I had to brag there for a second, it's a thing gamers do. But seriously, play however you want. You are gonna start over a lot of times anyway, so, don't be afraid to make some ''mistakes'' in your initial character. There are no rules. I always play as a noble hero, I don't steal, I don't attack some poor peasant for no reason, etc. But if you want to do that, you can! You can sneak around and assassinate poor innocent people, you can steal and bribe the guards if you get caught or even intimidate them! Play the game as a true role-playing game and be whatever you want to be and enjoy and explore that beautiful world...The gameplay of Skyrim, just like its quests and story, gives you a lot of freedom, to the point of breaking the balance. But in a game like this, it's not necessarily a bad thing. In most similar games, you choose a class such as a wizard or a warrior. in Skyrim you can be both and more at the same time. There is no level limit, so you can continue picking perks in all masteries and eventually excel at everything! This ''lack of balance'' is really not an issue in my opinion, for several reasons: It fits the story of the game, you are the mighty Dragonborn after all, it gives you freedom and it takes time and effort to get there anyway. The controls might be confusing at first. activating spells, equipping swords in both hands or equipping a spell in one hand and a melee weapon on the other, accessing your consumables, etc. But once you get used to it, it becomes alright. Now, here in 'gameplay' section, I'll have some slight criticism of the game. Even though I've talked about how much I love the open world, it is not big enough(I can't get enough of it). I don't know why I had not realized it initially, but after some time, one realizes how ridiculously small Skyrim is. You go from one village to another in mere minutes, and I don't mean fast travel, I mean on foot. You climb the highest mountain in Skyrim in a few minutes. This is actually a general thing about video games and most of the time for a good reason. For example, you can't make your tanks shoot at a few kilometers or miles in a strategy game, gameplay would have become so impractical, to the point of unplayable. But in a game like Skyrim, making a mountain really big would be to the benefit of the game, everything would have felt more epic. Imagine a High Hrothgar, the mountain I was talking about earlier, at the size of Mount Everest! Instead, you have something so tiny... It might not look so, but you realize it when it took you 5 minutes to climb to its summit. I'd rather have a real size mountain that would take real life hours to climb. This same criticism about the size also applies to the other games by Bethesda, namely Fallout games... Everything's so tightly packed, there are no spaces in between. Although it may be a good thing in the short term for a more active gameplay, I think it's to the detriment of the game eventually. And even though the game has a lot of replay value, I think that mostly comes from things that are not related to the size of the map. like people's choices, different races, etc. I would love to have a Skyrim in which I could discover some new things and places after years because of the size of it. Imagine if it was the size of Siberia or something like that. But I guess it would be technically too difficult to have such a big map and attention to detail at the same time. Maybe someday... I haven't talked about the mods because I never use any mods in my games, but that's an OCD thing of mine, I'm pretty sure there are a lot of good stuff in mods that I am missing out on. And because it is one of the most popular games of all time, there are plenty of people making mods for it. But still, the vanilla game alone is rich enough and it has several good DLCs on top. Good enough for me anyway.Despite this has been somewhat of a lengthy review, it cannot possibly cover everything about Skyrim. Buy it and play it. By the way, it is really a timeless game, if you are thinking that it's a thing of past or something, they have just released a 10th anniversary edition. And people still play and make YouTube videos about Skyrim and even the previous Elder Scrolls game Oblivion. Escape from reality's chains for a moment, it's not a bad thing...;10/10;14 November 2021;17 out of 17 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Greatest Open World RPG Made;Presentation: An elegant menu system and a huge amount of story content to dig into.Graphics: Stunning environmental detail make exploring Skyrim all the more rewarding. Some character models and animations look unnatural.Sound: An incredible soundtrack and great sound design help make Skyrim feel like a real place.Gameplay: Though the up-close weapon combat is still a little awkward, customizing your character and conquering all Skyrim's challenges is consistently satisfying.Lasting Appeal: A game of staggering size and filled with content, so there's always a reason to return.The game is amazing and you will spend hours upon hours finding every mystery of Skyrim, the guys behind the Elder Scrolls series are the true masters of open world RPGs, so you can't go wrong when you buy one of their games.;10/10;14 November 2011;62 out of 72 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;A must try game, for any person;It's been the better part of a year since they first announced that 'Skyrim', the sequel to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, was in production. I was pretty darned hyped, because I absolutely loved Oblivion and thought it was a great game, despite some problems it had.But as the release date for Skyrim neared I grew a bit apprehensive... I've played enough games from Bethesda that I knew it was gonna be great, but I started to worry it wouldn't live up to the massive expectations I(and many others, it seems) had for the game. Everything I had seen, from trailers to game play snippets to early reviews from those lucky enough to try the early demos all fueled my expectations, and I know from experience that even if a game turns out to be pretty darned good you can end up somewhat disappointed if it's not the masterpiece you envisioned it would be.Well my friends, three and a half weeks after launch, and some 109+ hours of time spent playing it I can safely say my fears were unfounded. Skyrim is easily one of if not THE best games I've ever played, and I've played hundreds.I will note that it is not without fault.. like pretty much all massive sandbox games from Bethesda it does have some bugs and glitches, but so far in my experience they are few and far between, and nothing that has distracted me much from the immersiveness and incredible scope that the game has to offer. I debated whether to give it a '9' rather than a '10' because of the very minor issues that have arisen, but I finally decided that the problems with the game are so tiny compared to the positives, that I would be nitpicking if I deducted a whole point. But to be fair, if I could score it out of 100 I'd give it a very solid 98.Todd Howard may be a genius, but he has some serious work ahead of him if he plans on eclipsing his own high water mark with this work of art. I for one wish him the best of luck. .) In my 25 years of gaming I've found that it's easy for a well made video game to keep your interest level high enough to be more enjoyable in hour ten than it was in the first hour of playtime, but it's a very rare game indeed that is more fun and more engrossing in hour 100+ than it was in hour 50. Skyrim is that game.;10/10;5 December 2011;37 out of 43 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Does this game ever end?;And I'm not talking about the quests, but the atmosphere, the feeling it gives, the sheer joy of being there. Skyrim takes what is great from both Morrowind and Oblivion, improving on it tremendously, becoming in itself a huge epic. Nevermind the bugs, the glitches. It is simply breathtaking. I must admit, I am what one would call a hardcore fan of the series, and very pretentious about my fantasies... This is a game in which the hero is a Hero in everything he does. As a player, you will never stop fulfilling prophecies. It is rewarding every step of the way, like no game before it. I have been playing Skyrim since November, finished it in December. Fan or not... I ask you... Why can't I stop (July the following year)? I have my own supposition. Maybe it's because this game never ceases to amaze me. It never ends. Just like the world.;10/10;5 July 2012;26 out of 30 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;the greatest game ever made;This game changed my life. I have probably played through it at least 15 times. I got this for my 8th birthday when it came out expecting nothing from it and here I am in 2019 after platinuming it twice on two different accounts and no game has yet topped it. I recommend this to anyone who is even alive;10/10;19 August 2019;14 out of 15 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Accessible, huge, addictive, attractive and great value for money in terms of £ per hour!;"I'm not really into all that wizards and dwarfs nonsense" I told a friend when he talked about the new Elder Scrolls game, a series I had no interest in and even less knowledge of. The connection to the Fallout games though meant that I knew the basic gameplay would appeal to me since I like the idea of RPG but not the incredibly detailed stats packages that most come with – selecting equipment, taking notes and digging in menus I'm fine with, but too much detail I'm not. As a result I picked this game up, still not totally sure that I would like the loss of guns and dark comedy that I got with Fallout 3 and NV.Very quickly I was into the game because I love getting caught up in the exploration, getting quests, finding stuff, building up my character and so on, all to the point where I really didn't progress the story very much until I had already played about 100 hours. The amount of quests is ridiculous and most of them do actually give you something to do other than just travel somewhere and come back. There are quests like that (the Thieves Guild "job" quests get tedious before you complete them) but they are the minority. The actual story is probably too short (ironic complaint for a game that I put down after filling the last few months and eating well over 100 hours). I left it at the end of Act 1 and when I returned to it I was surprised by how quickly I moved through the remainder of it to the end. I was also a little bit disappointed that the story did seem to stand alone and that it was easy to lose the plot if I spend ages doing lots of side-quests which rarely seemed to connection. Fallout NV got the mix better in terms of the storyline as so many side quests supported the story. It still engaged me because the vast majority of the quests were really enjoyable and provided lots to do and experience, just that they did fragment the story a little for me.In terms of the gameplay, it is accessible to the majority, which means lots of fringe players will be upset. So, for example, I would have liked the dungeon puzzles to have been harder, but I know they were still OK so as to be fun for me but not frustratingly hateful for those that don't like puzzles! The levelling up system makes a lot of sense to be – if you keep doing something, you'll get better at it – works really well as an idea and in practice. I know it upsets "proper" RPG players who prefer limits on who you can be and lots more stats, but I felt it worked – I didn't pick who I was at the start, my character grew based on how I played – so my magic stayed weak because I never used it, unlike other games where you just assign points to a skill to make it better. The gameplay is varied but well balanced – so yes there is trading and making potions, but there is exploring, battles, talking to others, puzzle-solving etc – nobody seeking just one thing to be perfect will be happy, but again this is why the game is accessible and enjoyable to more players.Graphically the game is beautiful. The load screens when entering a new area are fine until you're doing lots of rapid travelling, but in the open world of Skyrim you can walk for hours and hours and hours without ever seeing a loadscreen. The world ranges from snowy mountains to open green pastures and it all looks great. I did miss the humour of Fallout with this and the rather worthy talk of gods and kings didn't always win me over, but it still worked. The voice work is good and I accepted things like "all guards have the same voice" because such compromises makes room for more detail in other more important ways.Overall Skyrim has good variation in gameplay and is engaging. The world is full of quests and experiences, with so much to do and explore that you will be playing this for days, not hours. Perhaps not for everyone and perhaps not as perfect as the hype suggests, but this is still a very good and very engaging and once you get into it, you'll be playing it for a good long time.;Not Informed;23 January 2012;23 out of 27 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;The best game of the 21st century?;This game, really is one of the best games you'll ever play, a massive open end world, hundreds of quests, complete character customization, amazing story lines, you'll have trouble putting your pad down, I genuinely get excited every time I play this game, because of how massive the world is, every play through brings new adventures, new characters, new places, new stories and new rewards, you could play this game for months and find new things you previously never knew about, the graphics are out standing, immense game play, challenging boss fights, amusing dialogue, and a beautiful soundtrack really makes Skyrim stand out from all the rest, all I can really say is, if you're and RPG fan, and a fan of sandbox games, and want a game that's actually worth the price tag stuck to it, buy this you will not be disappointed!

Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Favorite game I've played. Ever.;I mean, how did they do this? I'm playing though for the 6th time now and with all of the mods there are it's interesting every time. I own about 300 video games and the only one I MIGHT like more is San Andreas. Only complaint I have is that because there are so many character combinations, your character doesn't have a voice. If you are looking for hours of fun-I've probably put 2000+ in-look no further.;10/10;27 March 2019;5 out of 5 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Endless stories to be told;While there is a main quest, Skyrim is unique in the fashion that you create your character and choose how they live their life. You create your own narrative, backstory, morals, and skills. Once you play through the game once you can play through many times and yet, you will never have the same story told twice unless you choose it to be. Want to play as a ex convict that found their way in life, fell in love, started a family and got a job fighting dragons? Or would you rather play as a mercenary just in it for the money and loot? Or maybe somewhere in between? Skyrim is a breakthrough in gaming. While there are glitches, they add to the the enjoyment of the game and will make you laugh. If you have it on PC I recommend getting some of the goofy mods to have more fun. This game is a must play.;10/10;4 July 2020;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Yes its good, but mostly quantity over quality.;Huge amounts of content and freedom, but more quantity than quality at times. Other than the main quest, most things feel a bit bland, repetitive and uninspired.Most places feel a bit lifeless, like the taverns, which are nearly empty and where next to nothing happens. Compare that to the taverns in, say, The Witcher games, which are bustling with activity. The terrible interface is built around the limits of consoles and their controllers. Level design is linear & restricted due to console hardware limitations. There is after all only so much you can get out of the Xbox 360's 500mb of system RAM! Most characters are still so 2-dimensional and a lot of voice acting is not convincing. There is also the usual lack of voice actors (kill a villain, then talk to quest giver who has same voice and tone).If you liked Oblivion, or just about any other Bethesda open world game, you will like this too, but in many ways this game is not a big step up from Oblivion. That is, the devs are resting on their laurels. I hope 2015's The Witcher 3 will be better than Skyrim, as that might kick Bethesda into trying harder to innovate and make the next game even better.The mod scene is very vibrant and there is a mod to improve on just about every weak aspect of the base game, but sadly, there are no huge seamless total-overhaul mod compilations, and getting lots of small mods to work together seamlessly is time consuming, and can be a total pain.Don't get me wrong, this is a decent game, and you could easily sink 100s of hours into it even if you don't like it that much, but it is certainly not worthy of most of the hype. While I would recommend buying this in a sale, it is still arguably worth the full price.;6/10;16 September 2015;8 out of 18 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;*EDITED* The latest Creation Club patch has killed Skyrim for good (consoles);Vanilla Skyrim was decent. It was always a beautiful world, with fantastic music, and very interesting lore and story-- even if told through an immersion-breakingly small amount of voice actors.But then there was bad level-up world scaling, where you level too quickly and attain gear upgrades before you even get a chance to enjoy the last bit of gear you earnt. EG, if you purchase/craft a full set of iron/hide and then go and do Bleak Falls Barrow, the first major quest, you will come back either wearing an entirely new set of gear, or it'll be available for purchase when you get back to town.Clunky difficulty modes, where novice = Godmode, Legendary = Enemies will 1 shot you via execution cam, and you will take unrealistic/boring amounts of time to kill them.Woefully balanced skill trees. Become a God with broken alchemy/enchanting, enjoy a reasonably balanced playstyle as a warrior, 1 shot everything as a stealth archer, or cast 30 fireballs at every opponent as a mage.And most importantly, there were SO many glitches. Some just comical, some game-breaking, locking you out of entire quest chains and stories.All of these factors made Skyrim an extremely enjoyable experience for a good chunk of time, but it becomes very obviously mediocre if you dedicated a lot of time to it.But mods fixed these issues. The modding community turned a game that was a solid 7, patched all of its weak parts, and strengthed the parts that were already good. A well-modded Skyrim could very easily be called a 10/10 game.The latest patch, by Bethesda, which has put a lot of mods behind a paywall on Console, has completely broken the game. A good 2/3rds of the mods I was using in my games no longer work, and nearly all of them won't be updated because they are several years old. I have saved files which have a few hundred hours of playtime, completely corrupted and unplayable. All because of Bethesda's greed.PC gamers can at least avoid this issue by reverting to an older patch of the game, but console users are just screwed. What was once a beloved game is now unplayable.Bethesda, you should be utterly ashamed of yourselves. I will never purchase another Bethesda game, even if they fix this mess.;1/10;19 December 2019;10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Whether it was a nord,or any of the other races and 2 handed, 1 handed 1 magic, mage, all of it. It is still my favorite game I've ever played. Im 30. Grew up with nes,snes,sega, e.t.c.

ALOT of my friends play it as well, so its not only therapeutic to play, but to watch. I've watched game play on YouTube to see others play as well. Needless to say, one of the best games ever made.

Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;My favorite game ever;I swear I most have replayed the story on this game at least 20 times. This game is a true masterpiece, from the story to open world this game is definitely one of the best games ever made. One of the main things I love about this game is that there is so much to explore, it's a huge open world game with so many things to find and so many collectables to collect. Bethesda really knew what they were doing when they were making this game, the graphics and scenery in this game are brilliant especially in the remastered version. The DLC were also good, one of them being a new location were the player can explore and do more missions. I would highly recommend people to try this game out, it's just a true masterpiece and one of the GOATS.;10/10;22 August 2021;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;An epic fantasy within an epic game!;Normally I do a Good, Bad and Verdict on my written reviews but in the case of this game, aside from a few minor bugs and nitpicks, I can't think of any complaints about this game. This is pretty much my perfect game!There are so many stories in this game, all of them really work well and in no way conflict with one-another, and with a game this big with so many stories within it, that must have been really tough. The main quest is very intriguing and builds to an awesome finish. Even the side quests and the downloadable content is very good, my personal favourite of these being the Dawnguard questline, though that is largely due to the new characters but will mention that in a bit.The world is absolutely beautiful, from the snowy environments and forests to the dungeons and caves. The detail in the world is immense and you could tell the team behind the game put everything they had into it, creating a unique land and filling it with unique characters and creatures. The Dawnguard expansion had some of the best environments not just in this game but in any game. The Forgotten Vale is unbelievably beautiful and it's extenuated by the musical score. I've heard that Jeremy Soule is the John Williams of video games and before this game I didn't think much of him. But in this game I'm completely sold on him and it feels like the timing and mixing is spot on. When you see something beautiful or threatening you get the perfect musical accompaniment for it. Obviously the main theme is epic, one of my favourite pieces of music of all time. As for the characters, despite having a lot of the same voices, they make up for in creating distinct personalities, including Lydia, the character everyone remembers. Though there are very unique characters with big name voice artists, like Christopher Plummer as Arngier, Joan Allen as Delphine and my favourite character Serana played by Laura Bailey. She has one of the best (if not THE best) back stories in the entire game, she has a great conflict and I love her interactions and reactions in the world. The enemies are awesome too, I love Alduin as the main villain, I love the Daedric Princes (Sheogorath and Clavicus Vile are my favs), I love Miraak and the other dragon priests, and even the dragons you fight can provide a major challenge.As for the character you control, he's anything you want him or her to be. You can just ignore the main questline and do your own thing. You don't even have to kill things, you can just go around and help people out and build your own house (with Hearthfire). Or you can even go around and literally do everything in the game and that's what a great sandbox game should do in my opinion. I love the enormous variety of weapons and armours and general clothing you can get in the game, my favourite combo being Ebony Mail, ebony gauntlets and boots, Zahkriisos the dragon priest mask, Nordic arrows and either the Ebony Bow or Ebony Blade. Kickass dark assassin look!I only have two issues with the game. One is the bugs and there are quite a few of them but with such a huge game there's bound to be a few. The other is the dragon riding mechanics they introduced in Dragonborn. It doesn't give you the freedom I wanted, and it's something that another one of my favourite games, Drakan the Ancient's Gates, trumps Skyrim. I desperately wanted something like that in the game but for what I got I liked it fine, especially seeing the world from that height.My verdict: It's my all time favourite game, I can't praise this game enough. I love it so much I'm actually gonna buy the Legendary Edition on PC so I can have everything for the game plus the Creation Kit so I can put my personal mark on the game. I haven't stopped playing it since I got it and I ain't slowing down now!;10/10;7 June 2013;10 out of 13 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim;Best Fantasy Game In Video Game History.;I wasn't really into magical, mystic, fantasy that much. I been wanting to try Skyrim ever since it became a meme and now 7 or 8 years later, I finally got my hands on it. I heard from people it's the best video game in history, it's overrated, too many bugs, it makes the game more fun. I decided to get into it for myself.While playing the game, I was very addicted to it and it would be the only game I played on the Xbox One from December to April. I finally beaten the story in July or August and decided to keep it for awhile and I stop. This game made me fall in love with the fantasy genre and it got me into watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The story was pretty simple, the music was heavy and inspiring, the combat felt strong and hard, and the journey takes the spotlights in this game.I was very glad that I actually played this game and want to try other Elder Scrolls games, mostly Oblivion. With The Elder Scrolls VI coming soon ( and hopefully make a new engine), I'm onboard with The Elder Scrolls series and its fans.;10/10;21 September 2019;5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Great, But Not Perfect;This game is fantastic, make no mistake. Music, graphics, world, characters (with some exceptions), story, choice and exploration are all huge improvements from 'Fallout 3', and if you're at all interested in Bethesda Game Studios' latest offering then I highly recommend you check it out.However, some flaws hold it back from surpassing the heights seen in previous games. The removal of karma and skill points greatly reduces the customisability of your character's stats, and the lack of a level cap means the need to replay the game is severely restricted, as a patient player could unlock every perk in one playthrough. The new dialogue system is a joke, and coupled with the voiced protagonist results in less choice or role-playing capability seen in other Fallout titles. It's painfully clear that 'Fallout 4' fell victim to the streamlining Bethesda implemented into 'TESV: Skyrim', which doesn't take away from the sheer fun factor but is disappointing to some RPG fans such as myself.Had Bethesda not begun development so soon after 'Fallout 3', vital lessons could have been learned from Obsidian Entertainment's 'Fallout: New Vegas', which features greater mechanical depth than either of Bethesda's Fallout releases and made huge improvements on the formula created in 'Fallout 3' that seem lacking in 'Fallout 4' or were left out entirely. For example, the factions system in New Vegas resulted in diverse endings and game worlds where in 4 there is little impact had on the world. The developments made in New Vegas' conversation system are curiously absent, making dialogue much less diverse in terms of impacts and outcome (likely due to the inherent restrictions of a voiced protagonist).In conclusion, this game is ****ing great, I can't stress that enough, but is held back (in my opinion) by simplified mechanics and a story and player character that restricts player choice and customization. But for sheer fun and value, this game is worth your time.;8/10;21 November 2015;32 out of 39 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;It took me 3 years to actually play this, and I regret that I didn't do I sooner.;Fallout 4 is probably one of the best games I've played. While it may have let down some, I think that it's great. The combat system isn't awful like some of the previous fallout games, the world is great and full of substance, items are great and NPCs are great (some are better than others). One thing that isn't as good a previous fallout games is dialogue. It's pretty 2 dimensional. There are situations where there's really only one direction to go in, even though there are 4 options. I would have liked there to be a way out of a conflict through dialogue instead of having to confront it. Overall great game.;9/10;24 December 2018;15 out of 18 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Sharp around the edges but ultimately a great game;Greetings from Lithuania.To think that i have invested around 100 hours of my life time into "Fallout 4" (2015), done the main story, made A LOT of side quests and the there is still A LOT to explore encourages me to safely say - "Fallout 4" is a great game.I had big expectations for "Fallout 4" because 3rd game was probably one of my all time favorites. And although 4th part did not improve on graphics - for this date and age, the game looks OK / good but nothing more, it did improve on almost everything else. I loved the story of "Fallout 4" - it was better then 3rd games. There is also a good twist in a main story which kinda makes you later guessing your actions. The open world to explore is amazing in this game. Literally when you walk to make one quest, you come back with 3 or 4 more to do. Later some of them were more like "fetch" quests, but there are plenty of interesting one. I loved weapon / armor crafting, house building stuff was OK but nothing more. There are tons upon a tons of places to discover, things to find or to kill. I played this game on hard more from the beginning and by the end i was like a bad ass / Rambo type character - the game is pretty easy even on hard mode. Overall, while "Fallout 4" isn't as brilliantly fresh as "Fallout 3" was, still this is an excellent game. Hope in a future they do make another one but this time with new game engine.;10/10;14 September 2017;16 out of 20 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;A vast world full of substance;From the moment the menu screen emerges and the familiar theme of fallout delicately plays in the background, there was no doubt in my mind I was in for a wild ride. Bethesda did not disappoint. The one thing that is most impressive about the game is its sheer ability to retain substance while simultaneously introducing a new atmosphere, full of varying and vast expanses that each hold their own character. The game continues to surprise me at each and every turn as almost every person I begin a conversation with has a deep back story, unique quest, or an occasional homage to the previous games in the fallout series. Bethesda has managed not only to maintain the high level of engrossment that the previous fallout games provided, but has built on their accomplishments. By including new features such as customising not just your own settlements but also your own weapons, and breathing new life into other factors such as the VATS and perk systems, the game has reached a level above and beyond any game I have played before. With the added factor of a mesmerisingly beautiful soundtrack that your character can change depending on their situation and stepping up a level with next generation graphics that make each area you visit a truly unique experience, the game deserves no less than a 10/10. Yes there are some bugs here and there but with a game as large and dense as this, they really don't take away from the experience whatsoever (and can sometimes be hilarious). Fans of the genre and the series should not hesitate to get this game, just be prepared for it to take up a large chunk of your life!;10/10;15 November 2015;28 out of 41 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Fallout forever! 💙;Fallout 4 is a wonderfulgame. First in 2015 still without the DLCs and bugged. I joined until 2018 and fortunately didn't have to go through this ordeal and got on straight away with the much-patched goty edition. It's now a mature game with incredible potential and various design options (e.g. Also but not necessarily first-person shooters or with a focus on SimCity/Sims/Settlement Development). It's running flawlessly for me now. But you always have to be careful, especially with mods and other changes. The strength of the game isn't the narrow or detailed story, but an open world worthy of the name! Almost everything is possible. You can follow the story, but you don't have to. The decisions are very important when you have to decide for/against one of the four factions (Institute, Brotherhood, Railroad, Minutemen). This should be carefully considered or delayed. It is its own (open) world in which there is always something new to discover. Due to the large number of mods and extensions, the game never gets boring and can be expanded or changed endlessly according to your own ideas. Because it uses the DX11 graphics interface, you have to pay attention to certain restrictions when modding in order not to "break" the game. I can fully recommend it and you can easily "sink" a lot of time.;10/10;7 May 2022;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;10 out of 10, and here's why;I, personally, love Bethesda games. I love Fallout, Elderscrolls, Doom, and Dishonered. My favorite game ever for awhile was the Elderscrolls: Oblivion. All of Bethesda's titles are jam packed with content that will keep you busy for hours. After seeing Todd Howard announce the next game, Fallout 4, I was pretty excited. I had loved Fallout 3. And after it came out, i avoided learning and spoiling anything about it. I finally bought it and put it in and was greeted with cool and funny cartoon shorts as my game downloaded. After it was done downloading, i was thrown right in. And let me say, I was not disappointed. I was thrown into a pre-war intro where you could build your own character and witness, in game, the world go to hell. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the story is great!Game play is great! There's improved gun play, new slow motion VATS, power armor customization, weapons customization, armor customization, Legendary enemies, great companion and romance systems, and a new great perk system.The game is set in Boston and is almost twice the size of Skyrim. The Main and side quests are all compelling and exciting. You are never at a lack of things to do. The setting is comfortable and brightly colored and there are many different areas with different kinds of enemies.Its a great game and I highly recommend it.;10/10;11 June 2016;10 out of 14 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;An Awesome if not Disappointing Game;Fallout 4 is the latest entry in the post-apocalyptic, role-playing franchise, Fallout. The trailer for this game generated loads of hype, and I, for one, was anticipating its release. This game was the first I purchased for the Xbox One and has managed to suck me in for tons of hours. While it is certainly not the strongest Bethesda game I have ever played, as that honor belongs to the Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, it is still a very good installment to the Fallout franchise. There are several noticeable changes that have been implemented to the game- some good and some bad. Several positive aspects of the game are the improved character creator, weapons and armor customization, an abundance of companions, lots of content and quests, and finally, power armor, which has been altered to support a tank-based, combat role. However, the changes to dialogue and a lack of varying endings neuter an otherwise solid RPG.;8/10;2 August 2016;6 out of 8 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Initially Loved It. But the More I Think About It, I Like it Less.;Fallout 4's gunplay and (some of the) gameplay are the best of the series. Hands down.However... pretty much everything else? Let's talk about it.The story is nothing to write home about. It takes a gigantic step back from F:NV in regards to that. There's literally two endings and that's it, whereas compared to F:NV there are several. choices actually matter in F:NV. And the actual "threat" in Fallout 4 isn't really that interesting nor intimidating.The companions are fine. base building isn't necessary and is incredibly tacky, so I'd honestly not do it at all because it makes no difference. Mr. Preston Garvey (one of the first guys you interact with) is annoying as hell, hence why he's a meme.The voice acted protagonist wasn't asked for. wasn't needed (clearly trying to be games like Mass Effect. the difference being a voice acted protagonist was there from the beginning...)The crafting system is fine and somewhat welcomed, although you can go without it. I did pretty much for my first playthrough.Overall, it's a fun game purely from a gameplay standpoint, but is overshadowed by many things that make it a bad Fallout game. It's a good game, but as a Fallout game? No.;6/10;17 April 2021;7 out of 9 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Loses some of the series' RPG qualities but improves in other areas;I think we may have been holding 'Fallout 4' up to a rather harsh set of expectations. 'Fallout 3' was one of the best games of the decade, and 'New Vegas' was another excellent title. Unless Bethesda pulled off the best game of the year, there'd be a lot of criticism.The introduction was great, and I'd place it leagues above the first scenes of 'Fallout: New Vegas'. Bethesda successfully place this game firmly within the context of a nuclear apocalypse, taking us closer to the initial devastation than ever before. It's also in the earliest moments of the game that you realise that your character can talk! Bethesda's long-awaited decision to give player characters a voice worked rather well, and I hope they expand on it in the future.Whilst I have praise for certain character-related modifications made in this game, there are also some problems. It's very hard to play an evil character in 'Fallout 4'. As many people have pointed out, your choices tend to range from 'very kind' to 'reluctantly kind'. That didn't really inconvenience me as I tend to play do-gooders on my first playthrough, but I do find it disappointing that the range of moral choice available to players in the earlier games has been significantly reduced.Bizarrely, as player choice is restricted where decision-making is concerned, it is expanded tremendously in another area: the workshop. For the first time, we are given the ability to expand a fairly vast number of settlements, giving you the choie to install security, add stores, build homes and - most importantly - attract settlers to populate them. One of the key factions, the Minutemen, also tie in with the settlements feature, as you'll often be called upon to defend them from a variety of Wasteland threats.I quite liked the Minutemen and their quests, but I wasn't so keen on the Institute. They just don't look as authentic as the other factions we've met. A certain degree of sci-fi can be very fitting in an apocalyptic RPG, and I think the contrast of '50s culture and futuristic technology really gave the earlier 'Fallout' games their charm. Around half-way through this latest game, though, I felt that they went a little too far. Given the importance of the Institute, this detracted somewhat from my ability to enjoy the story, but I still acknowledge that it had some very good moments.Do I think it's as good as 'Fallout 3'? No. Do I think it's a good game? Yes. I've logged well over 100 hours on it, so something must have worked!;8/10;22 February 2017;6 out of 8 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;It grew on me;Fallout 4 proved a bit divisive and 1 (the best), 3 and New Vegas are the superior entries but i still put 70 hours into the game and even went for all 3 fraction endings. The crafting system needs a do-over as the necessary items were given an inventory weight and the same applies to a lesser degree for the new conversation system yet i view both as a good addition to the Bethesda stable. The changed skill and armor system though need to revert back and the writer messed up the ultra-bland side quests big time while delivering the best Bethesda campaign and combat yet so i view the games as Fallout 3,5. It even fells like remake of F3 at times so i suggest fellow series veterans who liked that entry to keep at it if the game initially turns you off. It certainly grew on me as the main narrative went on. The developers lastly need to move on to a new engine! The bugs were reduced to a manageable level after the release and the landscapes are downright picturesque at time but the character models and animation are from another decade altogether. 8,5/10;7/10;18 March 2016;4 out of 7 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Underwhelming in relation to Fallout 3 and New Vegas;Just finished the first play through of Fallout 4.... Underwhelmed, it's more a smaller Fallout 3 map with more people/mutants running around everywhere..... Fallout 3 was a bigger map and it was a "wasteland" with large uninhabited areas. The side quests are mainly "go here and kill things". After a few of the side quests you basically end up repeating them over and over again. The encampment building is pointless eventually and just becomes annoying. That's not to say its a bad game, its not its good and I enjoyed it. Just not as wondrous as Fallout 3 or enjoyable as Fallout: New Vegas. Kinda seems like step sideways for Bethesda after the brilliance of Skyrim... Lets hope the promised expansion packs make up for the currently uninspired and occasionally repetitive game play.;5/10;8 January 2016;13 out of 23 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;I Love Parts of This Game but I Can't Deny All the Criticism Either;One of the biggest criticisms that gets lobbed at Fallout is the overall plot and the story of the Sole Survivor. I have to add that I haven't played any of the other Fallout games but I actually disagree. I like the overall arc of the Sole Survivor in Fallout 4 and his quest to find/avenge his family, I admit that it would be boring/too familiar of a revenge quest without the inclusion of the other factions but having played through the campaign twice, I was still caught up in it. I also really like the choose-your-own-adventure aspect of it, getting to pick which faction you support and seeing how it impacts the story is a lot of fun. I'm a bit of a sucker for when that mechanic is done well and this is one of the better games I've played that gives the player that kind of freedom (I'd also recommend the Far Harbor DLC for the same reason).While Fallout 4 is defined as an RPG, I agree with the fans that its more of a FPS with RPG elements. The positive side of this is that the gun play is well designed and tons of fun. If this kind of game isn't your specialty, the inclusion of VATS (its a targeting system that helps the player play percentages of where to strike at an enemy) helps keep the game play fresh. There is a lot of variety with the enemies you can fight against, the ability to upgrade your weapons and your armour to buff against certain types of foes and damage. It was ahead of its time and it holds up pretty well.I'd be remiss to not talk about my other favourite aspects of this game which is characters. The Sole Survivor is the audience avatar, he's got a driving force but you choose who he/she is or how they impact the Commonwealth. But the side characters are a colourful, vibrant and interesting group that I could continue to just gush about. They're alp distinct and grab your attention. The companions would be enough for me to recommend Fallout 4 alone and while your ability to interact with them properly falls short (more on that later), I couldn't help but be transfixed by their depth and their backstories at points in the game.I wish it was all just praise but this game does become more of a mixed bag upon revisiting it. Firstly, while the game features an ample campaign with many missions, the pacing does drag, especially in the introductory missions for the factions. You get a lot of the standard fetch/ eliminate the target quests and while that is to be expected, that can be tiresome. The next is the dialogue system. To be fair, this isn't easy to do, to create natural sounding dialogue while giving the player choice. But the summation of the option in the dialogue wheel isn't always accurate and when you step back, the cadence of the responses becomes easier to discern. A lot of the dialogue is clunky because of this and picking one option could lead to a different result than you desired because of the inaccurate summary. Lastly, the RPG mechanics aren't as finely tuned as they could be. It was clear when I was playing this that the previous games were more focused on this and that in an effort to modernize the franchise, it got pushed to the side. I didn't think they were as awful as some do but underwhelming isn't a bad way to describe it.Players of the classic Fallout games spit venom at this game and at Bethesda for diverting the the franchise. But coincidentally, most of the people who played this game first before other entries in the franchise (like me), really enjoy it for what it is. I haven't even touched on how big the map is and all the areas that can be explored (conversely, there's not as much aesthetic variety to the post-apocalyptic environment, another mixed element in 4). This game is the definition of a mixed bag with some strong virtues and some glaring weaknesses but its a memorable experience and even after playing the campaign twice, I'll probably revisit it again someday. If you're interested and willing to put the time in, I'd still recommend it. I'll play 76 someday but while that game was panned, at least this one had a mixed response overall?;8/10;6 September 2021;4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Two words: DAMAGE TRESHOLD (how to fix power armor);Since the franchise is so popular right now, I'll take advantage of this and point out some things that bother me about this otherwise very good game.I hope this review somehow gets the attention of a developer or something and they do something about this issue.The game has a major flaw, that can be easily solved with a patch: POWER ARMOR! One of the most appealing things about this game is of course the concept of power armor. However, they made it so wrong in this game, in my opinion. When you put a power armor, you need to start feeling like a demigod, but that's not the case in this game. It doesn't work as it should and you immediately need to repair your armor after taking a couple of petty shots from a raider or something. So, how should power armor be? There is a very good example, I don't even need to come up with my own idea, Fallout 2 did it perfect! Two words: DAMAGE THRESHOLD. In Fallout 4, the armor only acts as a damage reduction. This means, even in your power armor, a mere cockroach can still damage you, albeit in very small numbers. But that's not how armor works in real life, nor should it be like that in every video game. Again, Fallout 2 did it perfect, when you put the power armor, on top of damage reduction, you get something called 'damage threshold' this means, if the point of damage is below a certain number, that damage gets completely blocked. Which makes you feel the power of power armor. From that point on, a bullet from a pistol from a raider will do nothing to you, you'll only have to worry about real, serious weapons. If you think that this might cause balance issues, well, then you don't know much about Bethesda games. There is not a real balance in the first place, but if the developers want to balance the game, they can still do it with a power armor that I have described above.That's it! That's the whole review, I just wanted to point out this huge flaw of the game and hopefully get it fixed.;7/10;27 April 2024;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;It's good but they changed too much.;Fallout 4 takes place in a post apocalyptic world in Boston. You play a character as he tries to find his kidnapped son. Fallout 4 has the best graphics the game looks amazing. The combat has improved what times of new weapons being introduced in this game. Fallout 4 has a big open world with new lore and tons of places to explore. And like very other fallout game it's gives you so many choices for you to complete the main quest line and all the side quests! The game does change how the perks work and I think that is what I don't like. Overall the game is good but could have been way better.;8/10;13 July 2022;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Fallout 4;Expansive Sandbox With the Post-Nuclear Charm;I have not played any other Fallout game, so this game will be judged by me as a game overall instead of what it is supposed to be. Because I know that many said it feels less of a Fallout game. But it is still worth your time and money if you ask me.The open world is big. And I mean BIG. It might not have the widest area, but it is dense, with countless places to explore and fond loot. And while this game looks more sunny compared to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, it nails the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.The main quest starts on an interesting note, but there will be so much to do that you could get lost in other things. The game will easily give you over 100 hours of gameplay. And side quests aren't just throw-away side activities. they have their own stories too. But even with the main quest, it was an epic and satisfying ride.The characters are done very well here. While the karma system is gone (as I've heard), it is replaced by pleasing/disappointing companions, so there is still a system where you must be careful about the decisions you make. The writing with that addition is done very well, and I genuinely felt the emotion between your character and the companion, both in the positive and negative lights.Combat is just as you expect in the Fallout series, gunplay that isn't like any other shooter, with the iconic VATS system that allows you to target a specific bodypart of your enemies. And there will be a lot of nasty enemies in the wasteland. Also, if you are not into (literal) eye-popping gore, you've been warned.This games scores a 9.5 out of 10, with the only flaws being that it is midly repetitive and requiring some of the workshop building in the main quest probably wasn't a good idea. But this game will occupy a lot your time, and if you are looking for that, Fallout 4 will grant that.;10/10;14 May 2019;3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;An Instant Classic, Leaving Its Mark On The FPS Genre For Years To Come;This game for me is a top 5 greatest FPS games ever made. It is so much fun I can't even describe it. It adds more weapons from the previous doom while bring back old ones making the experience still feel fresh. New demons to slaughter some of them being super challenging and boss battles galore, however the bosses are at bit weak compared to the last doom but still fun in its own way. The progression is also perfect, it doesn't make you completely overpowered too soon, the weapons are earned at a steady pace and armor and weapon upgrades are split up well between levels.The few negatives I can think of are the fact that the mid can get really easy, mainly when you get the super shotgun and its story is weak,but are you really buying a Doom game for its story. Didn't think so. If you enjoy FPS games this is a must buy and so far a front runner for game of the year.;9/10;5 April 2020;17 out of 18 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Brutal fun;If this had a competitive Deathmatch game mode for online it would be an easy 10/10. While i appreciate what it's doing and I applaud the developers for trying something new I feel like a Deathmatch mode would be perfect for this game. The competitiveness between top players would be insane and it's a game mode every FPS player loves. That said, it's great to see the creativity when it comes to the game modes it actually does have for online.The Colours, the sound design, the soundtrack, the animations and in game mechanics are beautiful. The plot is engaging enough to carry us along nicely enough but we're here for the action, its DOOM. The plot is definitely secondary with a DOOM game and i'm so glad they decided to focus on the entertainment value of the gameplay. From an outside perspective it seems like the gameplay is quite manic and it will definitely seem that way for a while at first, but as you progress you'll find that if you want to succeed you're going to need to strategise. Lots of upgrades and add ons and abilities allow you to customise your character to your play style and enemies that used to feel like mini bosses are now just guys in the way. Some stages will overwhelm you for a while but once you figure the strategy out things become a lot more tolerable and you feel as if you've done more than just gone in there and mashed the shoot button. Very rewarding and great for re-play value.Interesting ideas that work very well. If you've never played a DOOM game before I think you'll still love this and if you're already familiar with the franchise you know what to expect and this is definitely going meet those expectations. It's Brutal, it's super fun, and its also self aware. It knows it's a goofy over the top gory shooter. Theres loads of secret items that give a nod to some of the earlier games. Theres a platforming element to it as well. Some people think it drains the momentum of the gameplay sometimes. I can see their point but I think it works well. If you find yourself at one of those sections of the game there's a good chance there are some collectables or an extra life to acquire and its fun figuring out how to get to secret areas of the map.Definitely recommend and be careful it's addictive!;9/10;22 March 2020;12 out of 14 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Razing hell will raise your heartbeat;Doom eternal is one of the best shooters of all time.

Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Fun, fast paced, and it'll make you feel like a badass !;If you enjoyed doom 2016, then you'll love this game. DOOM eternal surprisingly ended up being better than the previous doom game, being more challenging and more ways to kill demons.All around, amazing game. 10/10.;10/10;8 April 2021;8 out of 9 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Masterclass in FPS design.;Doom Eternal knocks it out of the park in pretty much every category from a gameplay perspective. Adjectives that describe it: FAST, FLUID, CHALLENGING, SMART, STRATIEGIC.Every weapon, mod, ability, and piece of equipment is both powerful and purposeful, and FUN! Glory kills replenish health, chainsaw supplies ammo, flame belch adds armour. There are AOE weapons, precision weapons, and strategic weapons that all have their place when battling the game's outstanding enemy variety. All this combines to improve the players skill over the course of the game and stay challenging throughout, with never a dull moment nor difficulty spike.Eternal's story answers questions left by it's predecessor while telling a pretty good one on its own, all while never taking away from the action. It's epic, well paced, and easy to follow.The game also includes a creative multiplayer mode that has surprising levels of depth and strategy. Battle Mode has two demons against one slayer and gives players lots of gadgets, tools, and abilities. It's well balanced and can rise to the same level of intensity as single player and even further sometimes! Unfortunately, it seems to be using peer to peer servers which can cause some nasty rubber banding and connection issues. I hope they can smooth these out soon. But when it's working well it's f--king awesome.This is an easy game of the year contender and cements DOOM as the most ledgendary and iconic FPS franchise ever. 30 years ago it put FPS's on the map, and now it's back on top. Buy it now!!!;9/10;1 April 2020;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Best Doom Game Yet!;If you thought Doom 2016 was fantastic, Doom Eternal is just like it but perfected. 2016 got us back to where Doom should be and helped it evolved, but Eternal took everything what 2016 did well and added to it and perfected it. The game mechanics from the get-go are familiar and feel more slick.Just like it's predecessor, it's a horror game. But YOU are the horror! While I did enjoy Doom 3 way back, playing the modern renditions is incredibly satisfying and feels like how Doom should feel. Whether you're wiping out entire hordes of demons through the incredibly satisfying gun play or beating a demon round the head with it's own arm through the glory kills, Doom Eternal offers gameplay that is as challenging and punishing as it is rewarding.I've yet to complete it and, as a HUGE Doom fan, I've done myself a disservice in not playing it sooner.If you're a Doom fan and you haven't played it yet, play it!THIS. IS. DOOM!;10/10;16 February 2021;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;The best game ever.;I've played 1000+ games and this is by far the best one ever.;Not Informed;31 March 2020;9 out of 12 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Average and weak at times;Despite being the first Doom game to be more narrative driven than just shooting and killing, other than Doom RPG, it's one of the worst Doom games, neck and neck with 3. The game features uninspired level designs where every city other than the metropolis' you go to have the same pseudo futuristic renaissance era cathedral like buildings which makes this journey fall flat for me. The narrative, which ties back to the classic Doom games I know and love, was what kept me going, but it got to the point where everyone does the talking, be it the Makyrs, Vega or Samuel Hayden and the gameplay wasn't complementing it, nor was the Slayer himself. It was a simple shoot em up game where they'd make a big deal about a certain boss fight and then chucking that same boss to cap off every other fight, making it all feel so repetitive. Not to mention, every level feels like you go up a flight of stairs and go into combat, go up more stairs and have some more combat, repeat and repeat and repeat until oh we're at the end. This style of gaming would have been good 20 years ago but not here. The gameplay itself, while fun, grows stale quickly. The demons now have weak points which make it a sort of dance to kill them, one that you repeat every time you meet them. Hell, all you have to use is the combat shotgun grenade launcher on the demons weak spots and you're sorted more or less.The game also features dated cinematics mid game where the screen fades black to show a weird angle of some gate being opened or fading away or a building blowing up to then fade back to the gameplay, something you'd find in a Ratchet & Clank or a movie tie in game, something that feels cheap and dated to me.The music as well is hugely annoying as I find myself quitting to my home screen so as to not subject myself to that noise any longer. It's as repetitive as the gameplay itself.It's a shame really as I really love the storyline but the execution of the gameplay is repetitive and really weak. The Fortress of Doom is a nice addition I will say. The deathmatch feels like it was put in there to keep 2016 online alive and to make use of their demon controlling system so as for it not to go to waste.All in all, the game is mediocre. A step down from 2016s gameplay but a win for s good story, especially in the Doom canonocity. Worth a buy if you want more Doom just don't expect too much from it and then you might enjoy it.;6/10;26 April 2020;5 out of 20 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Slaying Demons at Breakneck Speed;This game. This was the one I was most excited for this year. And it did not disappoint. It has become my favorite FPS, and one of my top 5 video games ever. Doom 2016 was already an amazing title that never got old, with an action packed and brutal campaign and a decent multiplayer component. Now, everything is back and cranked up to 11!The campaign is nice and meaty, longer than the previous game despite having the same number of chapters (13). There is so much more to explore and everything you collect has merit. Get all the cheat codes, you unlock classic Doom on a computer in your awesome Fortress of Doom. Get all the Praetor suit tokens, you unlock the final cheat code. Clear all the Slayer Gates, and you unlock something that will take you back to Doom 64. The amount of fan service in this gane is astounding, something vastly refreshing these days.How about the main game, as in combat? Superb. There a couple flaws, however. The purple sludge that you sometimes walk on, which slows you down quite a bit, can ruin the flow of combat. The punch without the Blood Punch filled up does close to zero damage, which can be a problem if you're swarmed by enemies. In the previous game, you can defeat some enemies with punches alone. And finally, using the chainsaw by pressing one button in front of an enemy can be a nuisance if it's not right on the spot. I preferred how in the previous game, you press one button to pull out the chainsaw, and then the attack control to saw the enemy. Besides, it also shows you how much fuel is remaining. But on the flip side, Eternal improves on the chainsaw by recharging the last fuel can indefinitely, meaning you can always use it on weaker demons and have an endless supply of ammo.The rest of the changes enhance the experience apart from Doom 2016. The dash is a welcome change. No longer having the unnecessary crouch, the dash now allows for traversing the area quicker, dodge deadly attacks, and rushing for an execution. No more missing glory kills. Which, by the way, are even better and more brutal with the Doomblade on the left arm, making demon sushi to go. Getting armor on the spot by burning enemies is one of the best changes as well. Gone are the days where you only have your health to live off of, as there was no way to replenish your armor without pickups. And for the weapons, they are the same weapons as the last game (minus the pistol), but they got quite the upgrade with better mods to wreak more havoc. And there are more demon types to to test your arsenal, including the new bosses. What changed is that you no longer shoot enemies until they die. You can, but there are strategies involved now with targeting weak points and exploiting certain move sets (Marauder). While I miss having only solo bosses back in the previous, I still felt the bosses were awesome and challenging, and the final boss is probably my favorite boss of this generation of gaming.Battlemode, the new multiplayer mode, is in my opinion the best mode id Software has created. While it has it's flaws, it focuses more on what Doom is about. A 2v1 mode between the Slayer and two player-controlled demons is quite the chaos. And it is hard as hell to learn, needing lots of strategy for the demons, and skill for the Slayer. A couple things I would like to change, however, would be for the demons to have limited respawns, as having to kill both players within 22 seconds can be frustrating, and I feel the player demons can use a damage buff while having there frequency of summoning other demons be reduced, so that the battles can be more focused for the players. As of now, it leans more towards PvE. And I hope other modes will be added (besides Invasion) so that this mode does not get stale. I would hate for this mode to die out because I still think it is great.Overall, Doom Eternal has set a new standard for FPS games. It is how a sequel is properly made, and I loved every minute of it. It is clear that id Software made this for the fans, to enjoy adrenaline-pumping gameplay while listening to Mick Gordon's master-class heavy metal. I cannot recommend this game enough to fans of the FPS genres, especially with this game dating back to FPS origins. An easy 10/10 for me.;10/10;11 May 2020;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;A breath of fresh air in a crowded genre.;There's so much to talk about in this game, but I gotta say that this game takes everything that made Doom 2016 great and improves on it. This is a game that's aimed more at FPS enthusiasts, but it's definitely worth it. If you're more casual and have played Doom 2016, I'd recommend playing at the lowest difficulty level the first time around to get used to the mechanics and gameplay elements.Pros:Awesome weapon selection. Guns all have a use. You can't just use the super shotgun and the ballista. You have to use weapons for different enemy types (I.e. Use the plasma rifle to burst enemy shields)Enemies all have distinct designs and attacks. The only enemy I loathe is the Marauder.When you're playing the game, it's like there's a "flow". You have to master this flow in order to win the game. Forget Dark Souls, you have split seconds to react and think. It makes the game uniquely intense.The level design is fantastic. I enjoyed some of the platforming. It felt cartoony yet fun.This game really doesn't hold your hand. There isn't really any scripted events of quick time events. Don't go in here expecting Call of Duty style missions.When you die, it feels fair.Cons:The Marauders.Platforming can be annoying at first. Minor complaint.Difficultly spike from Doom 2016 may be annoying for some. Again, you can change the difficulty to your liking.Solid 9/10. Tired of boring FPS games like Call of Duty? Here's something to truly test your skills.;9/10;27 March 2021;4 out of 5 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Hell Hath No Fury;Doom Eternal is quite possibly one of the greatest games ever. The sheer rage and masculinity of gameplay first discovered in Doom 2016 are amped up to unholy levels in Doom Eternal. The Doomslayer is an unstoppable force sent by the heavens themselves to vanquish the fires of Hell, and you feel every bit the part as you rip and tear through level after level. The weapons are amazing. The enemies are vicious. The glory kills are brutal. The boss battles are visceral. Not a single flaw comes to mind. This is FPS evolved. This is Doom.;10/10;1 April 2020;6 out of 9 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Amazing;The game creates a very interesting gameplay. When you have to kill, in order to stay alive. This tactic is also a thing that keeps the intensity high and the game exiting. It is true that the story is not all that great, and the cast of characters are way too big, but the game more than makes up for it with crazy fight sequences, epic boss fights, great narrative of the game and a great game.At the end: if you enjoyed the previous one, than you will enjoy this one too. Doom eternal is a slight improvement from the first game. With great action, crazy battle, creative weapons and Easter eggs, epic gameplay style and an almost perfect game after all.;9/10;12 November 2020;2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Another rock em shoot it up sequel but nothing new to the series.;3 out of 5 stars.Doom Eternal continues were the last game left off. The Doom slayer battling through dimensional demons and this time trying to stop them from destroying earth. The plot has always been thin on these games. Which kind of sucks. The story has always been forgettable. This sequel does not add anything fresh to the series. If you played the last game. This one is no different but adding different levels. Every room you go too it is all about how many enemies can we throw at you. It is only fun for a couple of chapters in the campaign. Until it gets very repetitive once you continue further. It gets boring after awhile. Enter a room. Shoot through many demons as you can. Try to restock on ammo. Go to a different room and repeat. Game play is only fun for a few chapters until the last half of the game gets boring. Nothing but a heavy rock blasting and a lot of big guns and demons you got to shoot through. It's very gory and bloody. It's Doom. What can you expect.The graphics are decent. Nothing lifelike or realistic. I am still a fan of Doom 3 when it came out for the Xbox. Which delivered a fun and horrifying first person shooter. The graphics is nothing special.The controls is simple but confusing when you have to remember the buttons to use the special in guns or have to go in the options menu to change the gun special.The gameplay is decent. It's all action packed and first person shooter in blasting through levels of demons and sawing through them. It's very repetitive and gets old halfway through. Then there are some boring moments where you have to jump on ledges to another to get across which is frustrating and boring. One of the boss fights is annoying and dumb. The final boss fight is bloody fun.Overall, Doom Eternal is a fair game. It was fun for a while until the game is repetitive with the gameplay which is boring. Shooting through demons is fun for so long until every chapter is the same. The story sucks. The gameplay is eh. The replay value i will not be playing through 12 chapters again. Playing it once was enough and not as enjoyable.;6/10;16 April 2020;6 out of 31 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;DOOM Eternal;Herd Mentality- Don't believe the hype...;Before you read this review , please note that I played the game on PS4.I was really excited to get my hands on this title. I played all originals in my youth and the 2016 Doom. I really enjoyed all the previous versions. From the reviews one could assume that this is a more polished version, that the makers listened to the fans. What you actually get is a rushed product that spoils the game and leaves you disappointed if not upset. After all, this is not just any game...I was not expecting much from the story so was fine with the plot. Minute cosmetic changes to graphics and weapon modification would be liked by some and disliked by others but they do not change the gameplay significantly, compared to the previous title. The shoulder cannon, borrowed from Predator franchise, does its job. The demon slayer is now jumping and climbing a lot more, turning into a squirrel, hopping from one column onto another in a rather similar fashion. I found it rather comical but not to the point that would spoil the enjoyment of butchering all evil.What became a very apparent let down was the glitching. You will often find your character falling into lava and then through it... The opponents will fall or get trapped in walls or doorways, shaking and juddering. I ignored it once, twice and then realised that this game was probably not ready for release. You will find overlapping textures and rocks with perfect, polished angles as you look for secrets in far corners of each map. Sadly, these are not the only let downs...I started the game on 'hurt me plenty', being realistic about my skills, and had to change it to 'I don't want to die' during the last fight of the first level as it was simply impossible to get through. I found this spike in difficulty followed by a very easy chapter two, where I switched the difficulty up and then some, even before I upgraded my character. Such uneven difficulty progression, as you shoot your way through the game, is another evidence of neglect in order to cash on the success of the previous title. And the soundtrack is just awful, imagine Trent Reznor giving his keyboard to a toddler- you get the idea... All in all, the game is playable. I would probably put up with all the shortfalls if I spent half the money on some less known title but this is Doom. You should not do this to Doom.;3/10;27 April 2020;4 out of 23 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Action man.;'Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (2017)' is the sequel to 'Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014)', a franchise revival that took the series back to its roots. This game carries on where the previous left off, introducing extra elements to its gameplay and generally refining things even more than before. However, it is an inferior experience for a couple of key reasons. Firstly, the game doesn't strike a great balance between plot and gameplay, with long cut-scenes constantly interrupting the flow of play. Secondly, it doesn't have a very good tonal balance, which makes the story difficult to become engaged with. Finally, it takes a long time to get fully underway and feels like it's stopped short because of it. The story really is quite silly, told mainly by over-the-top characters spouting long, uninteresting speeches. It isn't compelling in the way you'd expect, especially since its predecessor's narrative really is quite good. Having said all that, the game still is a really fun time when it gets out of its own way. The best aspects of it are actually optional side-tasks that see you returning to previously explored locations in order to assassinate a Nazi official. These segments focus wholly on gameplay and are all the better for it. On the higher difficulty settings, the piece becomes decidedly less enjoyable than it ought to be because you simply aren't afforded the health or ammo to 'run and gun' the way it wants you to. It can be really challenging at times - frustrating, even. Ultimately, though, the game is still an entertaining time. Its shooting is refined and its extra mechanics are typically successful. Its flaws don't prevent you from playing or, even, massively reduce its overall effect. Hopefully, the developers manage to find a balance between the gameplay of this title and the storytelling of its predecessors. 8/10;8/10;22 April 2020;6 out of 8 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Incredibly Well Designed Short Film;Wolfenstein II is a game about executing Nazis with a hatchet and talking to yourself after performing literally any action. It has great gameplay, graphic / character design, story writing, and (usually) gameplay. It does however suffer from relatively bland gameplay at times, (I thought the first level being played entirely in a slow wheelchair was a stupid idea) and a playtime shorter than that of an indie RPG. Cutscenes drag on for a loooooooong time and skipping them could leave you confused. The humor also feels a bit off and writing isn't always the best. The worst thing though is probably the repetition of the level design, with it basically always boiling down to "find commander, execute, kill soldiers, move to next area, repeat" which usually leaves you wondering when the game's gonna end.TL.DR game good, suffers from short runtime and bland gameplay;7/10;25 October 2019;8 out of 12 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Great graphics and story but to linear;Greetings from Lithuania."Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus" (2017) is a better game then its predecessors, and those where pretty good. This one has better story and storytelling but hey, you don't play "Wolfenstein" for great storytelling - you do it for shooting and some more shooting. And on that this game is very good. There are plenty of guns, and even more plenty perks for you to unlock them all. But for my taste this franchise is a bit to linear - i prefer more open worlds and exploration.Overall, "Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus" is a highly solid shooter with cool story and good storytelling. It features great game play and its only downsize is that it was to linear for my taste.;8/10;27 May 2019;10 out of 17 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Slick Gameplay, Innovative Plot;Wolfenstein 2 is the only game like it on the market. It tackles the sickest, ugliest aspects of tyranny while laughing at how stupid tyrants actually are and the pointless, rippling horrors just a few men's insanity metastasizes like a cancer on humanity. The characters and themes may not be for you if you're looking for a more standard CoD soldier plot, but if you love over-the-top characters, alternate history, fresh representation of social movements, and vicious gunplay, then this game is for you. And if you just love killing nazis and watching genocidal tyrants miss pissing in buckets and cry out for their mothers, this game is also for you.The gameplay builds upon and polishes that found in The New Order. It's pretty Doom-like in its fast pace, satisfyingly huge guns, and heaps of ammo, yet still contains stealth and cover mechanics that work well. You're almost always given the option on how to approach an encounter, and on the higher difficulties, skillful cover and memorization of level design are rewarded. The gunplay feels slick and AAA, with variety between combat sections, a few vehicle-ish moments, and a steady trickle of new guns and perks to unlock based on your playstyle.But the plot is where Wolfenstein shines. There are a few places where the pacing feels fast or off (flashback sequences especially), but everything else is dripping with style. Some may not enjoy how quickly it shifts from serious to comedic, but the way in which it does so, with movie-level camerawork, acting, and music, was like candy to me. The situations characters find themselves in push the bar of insanity, with invariably brutal payoffs.The heart of Wolfenstein is still BJ & Anya's story, though, with Anya now a kickass pregnant resistance leader whose lover is still dealing with the events at the end of The New Order. You ache to see BJ survive not only because he's just an endearing character, but a soon-to-be-dad and great partner who has overcome a tragic upbringing. He won't have his kids growing up in a Nazi world, so every stab, headshot, and mindless kill feels personal and righteous.An example of how the plot gets variety right is BJ's birthday party. After several levels of desperate fighting, tensions get relieved via a drunken submaritime bash that leaves Fergus with a missing arm and everyone with hilarious regrets.The characters, although a bit heavy handed at times, offer more variety and fresh takes than I've seen in any game short of, say, GTA5. All nationalities, mental capacities, and body types are celebrated, but not in a preachy sjw way. You're the last bastion of beautiful humanity that the nazis want to crush, so it makes sense that so many types of people would wind up in one place. Watching them form a family is gratifying.The score is fantastic as well, and seamlessly switches from grindy electric battle music (again similar to Doom) to period-appropriate rock and roll with a grungy futuristic twist. Throughout the levels are tons of collectibles, including funny records that imagine what bands like The Beatles would have made under an oppressive fascist regime.So if you're a fan of great single player stories and polished FPS gameplay, Wolfenstein 2 might be just what you're looking for.;10/10;14 September 2018;14 out of 24 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Amazing story;I only just discovered you can review games here! I actually played this one about a year ago.The story in this is really incredible. It's almost like an interactive movie at times. I don't ever remember caring about the game characters as much.I wish it didn't have the venus scene. Everything hung together pretty well until it was suddenly revealed the Nazis have UFOs and can get to Venus in mere hours. What were they thinking? This idea clashes VERY BADLY with the other technology in the game.The gameplay sometimes is boring, a little too predictable. Step A tends to follow Step B. It doesn't take long to learn whatever sequence is required to beat a tough scenario. And a lot of the scenarios just aren't that tough. Unfortunately just running from room to room shooting guards wears pretty thin.The exception, and one of the game highlights is the jury room scene, I felt like I could play that over and over, and it was really challenging.;8/10;17 April 2022;4 out of 6 found this helpful.

You die too quick to play the game fast and hiding behind cover is boring. The game never really picks up either.

Slaughtering Nazis have never ever felt this good before!Thanks to a very good map design and a lot of interesting collectibles (as well as many "readable" newspapers, diaries, letters etc which gives you insight not only into the life of the nazi soldiers but also into the life's of the normal Americans and recently arrived Germans) It took me just about 20 hours from start to end on medium difficulty. The map design and all the collectibles as well as the opportunity to sneak around all enemies to try and take out the officers first (only the officers can raise the alarm and call for reinforcements) makes you actually wanting to find out what happened in the very different cities you're visiting.All in all, this game was a blast! Great gun play with the possibility to upgrade almost every weapon, great level design, very graphically improved from the last game along with new shades and lightning, great character-driven story and a lot of crazy moments that will make you remember this game for a long time makes for an extremely well crafted old school fps in a world filled with multiplayer games and loot boxes. Kudos Machine Games!;9/10;31 October 2017;35 out of 122 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;When you hold back and use some stealth it is so much more enjoyable;Absolutely loved the story and the characters! The combat system was so much fun and I love that it gave you a choice between stealth or just hardcore killing. Believe me when you hold back and use some stealth it is so much more enjoyable.

Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;A step back comparing to previous game;The positives: bad ass story, great acting and music, dual wielded weapons still feel amazing.Negatives: bad level design, bare bones stealth mechanics which game constantly pushes you to use, AI is lazy and unfair.To survive any decent difficulty you have to be constantly on the move but absence of auto pickup makes you stop every time you need to stop and pixel hunt for pickup icon to get any ammo, armor or health.Aiming is quite rubbish. Many levels have terrible flow, most of the time every NPC will gang up on you in the first two rooms and then you run around empty rooms.;4/10;14 May 2021;4 out of 6 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Why?;Do you know why I play video games? Escapism. It's the same reason I watch movies. When the eternal nanny state gets too much for me, I lock myself away and play video games or I watch movies. Nowadays, however, it's no as easy to escape the nanny state via either of these means, because the nanny state sees to it that their politics has to be rammed down our throats via these two mediums, too.I gave the game a 5 for the gameplay - which is as good as I've come to expect from this franchise - but I cannot stand the constant leftist agenda injected into my hobbies!

Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Still buggy and broken years later.;As the title says. On PS4 trophies are glitches badly and generally there's a lot of unacceptable bugs in a game they released with multiple rounds of dlc. Bethesda has completely become a shadow of its former self. Also this game has an obnoxious amount of collectibles. If you include writings, there's nearly 300 collectibles in the game. Further there's areas in the game that are unfairly difficult. Added to this is the extremely sub par stealth system where one guy seeing you alerts the whole area without even hitting an alarm. There's other issues like how stealth takedowns don't mix with stairs, which feels like amateur hour. If you get it free on PS Plus, sure, but don't pay money for this.;2/10;19 May 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus;Deplorable!;I loved Wolfenstein the New Order, but this game was terrible. My biggest complaint was the storyline. by the time The New Order ends BJ should only be like 40 years old, and yet in the beginning of this game they make him like 60, and then he spends the entire first half of the game being just so mopey, and just not cool. Plus the amount of gore, foul language, and sexual immorality in this game was disgusting. The other thing I didn't like was the gameplay combat felt too realistic, and not as smooth and fast as the first games, so unfortunately the gameplay wasn't as fun as the first two games either. Do I still love the Wolfenstein series "yes" but does there definitely need to be a lot of improvement from this game "yes".;3/10;13 June 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;An absolute masterpiece;Prey has got to be one of the best games of this generation, maybe even one of my most favorite games of all time, the story of Prey is about a person, either male or female, named Morgan Yu, who inside a huge station known as Talos I, after an incident at some test, you wake up in your apartment, yet something is up, after escaping, you must pick up the pieces, find out what's going on, and escape, the story is great, there are really interesting twists during the story, characters, and mysteries, the sense of freedom, and exploration is very well done here, while you are in Talos I, you are given the opportunity to explore several open areas, where you can find hidden items, supplies, and side quests, speaking of side quests, there are quite a lot of them to do, they can vary from simply searching for someone to finding maps to a treasure, the quests are quite fun and varied, the gameplay is also amazing, gunplay is smooth, visceral, and intense, and the horror elements add a sense of desperation, intensity, paranoia, and helplessness, which makes the game even more heart-racing, the game is also challenging, this is not a game where you run and gun like in call of duty, you have to think before you act and pick your battles, and the the AI is really good with a few problems, and there are supplies such as ammo, medkits, food, notes, neuromods, key cards, and side quests that will give you an incentive to explore, speaking of neuromods, they can give you the ability to upgrade Morgan Yu, with perks such as Hacking and Repair to increased strength and health, giving more replay value to the game, if you just do the story, it could probably be around 15 hours, but doing all side quests, exploring every nook and cranny around Talos I etc., will bring that up to 40 hours, with massive replayability through different builds and critical choices you make throughout the game, my playthrough was around 30 hours, but I still had several side quests and places that I haven't fully explored, this is a game that must be played and that is absolutely worth your time and money;9/10;10 December 2017;15 out of 17 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;simply awesome;Almost perfect video game. This is a great game for getting scared. Really good horror. I originally played the demo on ps4 & it was so scary. Then did the entire game, with start do-over. It was tons of fun. The only reason I opted for 9 stars is because I felt like the game became too repetitive towards the end and I basically got bored & wanted to finish it quickly. Repetitive meaning especially in regards to creatures -- there were no more new horror creatures to explore! -- which was sad because I was thoroughly enjoying myself. The storyline is great, no complaints there.;9/10;26 November 2017;14 out of 17 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;Great game;Greetings from Lithuania."Prey" (2017) is a very original video game. It has all requirement for it to be a first person shooter (which it kinda is), but its hard to compeer it to any first person shooter. It has great story, and only a kinda disappointing ending was the reason I did not gave it a 10/10. This game has very unique for its genre gameplay mechanics, were you can approach your goal in many ways, the game gives. Also I was constantly surprised of the world this game takes place in, because it really is a very good sci-fi setting.Overall, I highly enjoyed "Prey" until its a bit of a lackluster ending. Other then that, its a very original game.;9/10;3 January 2020;8 out of 10 found this helpful.

Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;Get this game, you'll love it;This is by far one of the most addictive games I have played recently, although at the beginning it seemed slightly disappointing mostly due to the graphics. Things however got better shortly, so don't judge it by the cower. As an RPG it has a lot of space and great maps. The level up system is detailed and fun. Creatures are nicely designed and not easy to kill unless you choose the easiest option. This is no shooter, make no mistake, this is a survival game. Prey can be a little disorienting at times, but if you love exploring, looting, finding hidden passages/shortcuts, you'll love it. The combat is very well done too. I personally got this for a very good price and enjoyed for almost a week. Would love to see a Dlc or even Dlcs.;10/10;27 February 2018;14 out of 16 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;The best game EVER.;When i started to play PREY, I was a bit skeptical. When I finished it I was almost in tears. Weeks past by, but I couldn't stop thinking about this game. This music.. horror like sounds.. Approximately for 1 month after finishing PREY, I couldn't play anything else, because all other games seemed so dum and boring. This game brought me a fantastic experience. Very immerse and with ideal story. Even had issues with my wife, because the only thing I could do when I had a free time, was to play PREY. In my opinion this game is one of the best computer games humanity ever had.;10/10;27 March 2018;12 out of 16 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;Good morning, Morgan.;'Prey (2017)' is a first-person 'immersive sim' set aboard a space station that's been recently overrun by a whole host of otherworldly aliens, including the elusive 'mimick' which can disguise itself as any object on board. The name of the game here is choice, with the player being given free reign to complete their objectives in whatever way they want. Exploration is more than encouraged and, usually, all solutions are valid. That's what's so satisfying about the experience. It gives you a set of systems, which evolve somewhat over the course of the game but always remain consistent, and lets you loose with them. Its heady story, full of twists and turns, is meant to be engaged with on an intellectual level. you're supposed to think about what you're doing and why you're doing it. It's great fun that's incredibly immersive from start to finish. It's also rather unique, despite being obviously inspired by games such as 'System Shock (1994)', 'Bioshock (2007)', 'Deus Ex (2000)' and Arkane Studios' previous 'Dishonoured (2012)'. It's a game you won't want to stop playing. It's absolutely fantastic. I'll almost certainly be returning to it in the future. 9/10;9/10;26 August 2020;7 out of 9 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;A forgotten gem!;Prey is one of those games that somehow got overlooked and almost forgotten. Picked it up by chance and haven't put it down since.

Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;Not talked about enough;If you are a fan of survival horror games and you haven't played this yet, drop everything and get this game IMMEDIATELY.It's challenging in all the right ways, it's innovative in its resource/leveling system. All aspects of the gameplay are infused with the story and setting. It's one of the most cohesive and rewarding game experiences of all time.Nothing shows this better than the map itself. Talos1 is a 1:1 completely fleshed out Space Station/Research Facility and by the end of your playthrough you will begin to see it's grand design and understand it's genius as every area is meticulously placed both inside and outside of the station. Most areas have airlocks that allow you to fly around the station and jump the different locations (some through hull breaches in the stations walls). There is also a grand lift that shoots through the middle taking you to the three main hubs. Then there is the G. U. T. S that allows you to float through the maintenance tunnels of the station and get around that way. It's so creative and well thought out and each zone has its own story and they almost all intermingle in some way.Which brings me to another point, the story is DENSE. Specifically the world building and the personal stories of everyone in the ship's crew. More than any other game I've played the creators spend an incredible attention to detail compared to other games of this genre. When you see a dead body in a hallway or stuffed behind a maintenance shaft, they have names, and usually a specific story as to what they were doing before everything went to hell and how they ended up there. to the point that you can literally look up EVERY crew member of Talos1 by the various security terminals in each zone. This game is DETAILED.So go do yourself a favor and pick up this game and enjoy not wanting to play anything else for the next month or so.;10/10;26 May 2022;1 out of 3 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;Game design at its absolute best;Pros -- The story is amazing. Oozing suspense and intrigue, with plot twists that blow the mind, characters whose motives are unknown, and a constant doubt about who to trust (possibly including yourself). All that while dealing with a mysterious, unnatural enemies. You even get suspicious about how you 'level up' your character, in a way. And you need to make deep, ethical decisions based on the often limited information you have.Collectible texts and audio logs, unlike many other games are not just for history and world building: they provide clues, secret codes, technical tools for unlocking certain areas, and tips for tackling certain enemies. It's integrate well.The 'world design' and degree of openness ve linearity is perfect. It's neither one of those games where you just run from one area into the next battle after battle, nor one of those ones that just dumps you in a sprawling, 'open' world with little guidance. Instead, it starts off with access to a small area, with access to larger and more areas expanding as the storyline progresses. It ultimately does end up entirely open (and is surprisingly massive), but it builds towards that in a semi-structured and guided manner. Again, it integrates well (story and world access).There are two styles of gameplay, depending on which part of the world you're in. I'd spoil it if I was to say exactly how - but what is important os that it adds to the variety, as well as tying into that 'mind blowing' impact the game often has. It never gets monotonous.Weapons and abilities are generally vastly different from each other, and many are unique to the game. Resources gathering (for 'ammo' and for building tools, weapons, and equipment) is almost perfectly balanced. You're constantly on the edge of running out, without being left stranded with nothing for long. Tension without frustration.There are a range of enemies, of very different types, and a certain type of enemy gets more and more impressive/scary at just the right stages in the game. Additionally, the final stages of the game really ramp up the pressure, creating an increasing sense of urgency as the story reaches its climax.To top it all off, it's one of those games where there is often more than one or two ways to do something. You can develop your character in a range of ways. you can gain access to 'locked' areas in a range of ways. you can find secrets all over the place. and you make meaningful plot choices that impact on the final outcome (yet manages a satisfying conclusion no matter what decisions you made).Cons -- The music and atmospheric sounds are fine, but aren't especially impressive.Open-world style bugs, although very rare, do exist. (ie. Some 'quests' or 'characters' can fail to appear if you explore areas in a particularly unexpected order).The art is pretty mediocre - especially human faces. The characters and dialogue are well-developed with human/realistic personalities and relationships, but you can still feel like you're interacting with mannequins due to the plastic-y and emotionless facial expressions.;10/10;7 February 2023;0 out of 1 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;It Took a Little While to Settle in but the Hype and Endless Praise are Justified;The plot for Prey is lengthy and would resemble a small novel as opposed to something that could be well summarized into 2 or 3 bullet points. The quickest I can distill the story is that the game takes place in an alternate version of history, the year is 2032 and the Transtar corporation is conducting research on board the ship Talos 1. The Soviet Union previously discovered a race of dangerous aliens called the Typhon and they co-operated with the United States government to subdue them. The US government helps keep this quiet and eventually takes over the project when tensions rise between the two nations. Study on the Typhon continues until the year 1980 when the Pobeg Incident occurs. Scientists are killed by the Typhon aboard the former Soviet satellite the Kletka. The research project Axiom is abandoned and the satellite is left with the live Typhon aboard. Transtar purchases the satellite in 2025 and re-institutes the research with the goal of creating "Neuromods." These are injections that grant super power like abilities based on what the Typhon can do. We join Morgan Yu (you can choose whether the protagonist is male or female) in 2030 as a high ranking member of Transtar about to travel to Talos 1 (the re-branded Kletka) to join his brother Alex Yu in developing the neuromods. Things go array QUICKLY and in ways that you wouldn't expect (I don't want to spoil it, the opening reveal/twist is something that should be experienced in the moment). Prey's story is surprisingly layered and while it might not spell everything out for you immediately, the reward is in the gradual unveiling. Things are not what they seem aboard the Talos 1 and that's outside the shape-shifting aliens that want to rip you limb-from-limb.It's easy to categorize Prey as a FPS but you'd be shortchanging the game with that assumption. Where other games wall you off from certain parts of the map or rigidly manage where you go, Prey largely lets you traverse Talos 1 unimpeded. There's an amount of freedom in the game that you don't always get in this genre. There are puzzles to solve, resources to manage (the game requires you to recycle junk to give you the raw material to craft things like ammo, health or gun upgrades) and several different ways to arrive at the solution. One weapon specifically plays a large role in this, the GLOO cannon freezes enemies in place and allows you to more easily melee or eliminate them. But the GLOO gun can be used to scale walls, create bridges etc. It's a nice complement to the solid action and it's another way in which the game refuses to just hand it to the player (the effectiveness of this idea is mixed, more on that later).By the time I finished Prey, I had completely gotten on board. There's been some complaints about the effectiveness of the ending but I think it was a bold and inspired choice. Any game can end in a big fight and the world is magically saved, I appreciated that they tried something different. They pay some lip service subtly to a morality system throughout the game and it affects which ending you're presented with. There are also hints that there's a larger game afoot so while the conclusion was surprising, it didn't feel like dirty pool. I really dug it and I'd actually encourage more developers to take a page from Arkane's book.I only have 1 complaint when it comes to Prey and while it may come across as a little petulant, I'm not the only one with this view. Prey is HARD at the beginning, to the point it passes past the point of an enjoyable challenge. Your character is deliberately under-powered and you can run into high level enemies in any given area. Some have argued that it encourages puzzle solving, stealth and exploration to pick up items and gain XP but I found that hard to believe as I was terrified to go anywhere but the waypoint on the main quest because I would die so quickly. Eventually, I levelled up to a point where I could investigate other areas and gain new abilities. But I'm not going to begrudge anyone for getting frustrated when starting this game, it's tough and it takes some fortitude to acclimate to how punishing Prey can be.I didn't love Prey from the beginning, I actually contemplated giving up on it at around the 25% mark. The story was impressive and the mystery of Talos 1 was great (along with the surprisingly stacked voice cast, Benedict Wong's work as Alex is hugely underrated in helping Prey deliver) but I just kept dying over and over again. I stuck with it however and through my stubbornness, I got better at it and finished the game. This game is exceptional in many areas and I now get why it's on everyone's list of criminally underrated games from the previous generation of consoles. I didn't even touch on how scary and varied the Typhon types are (if you don't like jump scares, this game might be a little annoying for you). Prey deserved more attention and bigger sales and if you get the chance to play it, I'd absolutely recommend you to do so.;9/10;14 January 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;Why do enemies one shot on normal?;The game is so unbelievably hard that I believe I have died more in Prey than in Elden Ring and the Demon's Souls remake combined. and I have only played for 4.5 hours or so. Trust me, I like when a game presents a challenge. however, when I say that this game is "hard", I do not mean it as a compliment, but rather a design flaw. For context, I am playing on normal difficulty (blows my mind knowing there are two even harder difficulties). A lot of the enemies just one or two shot you, and it feels like you can't even fight back. The combat is very clunky: there is no dodge button (you can only try dodging enemy attacks by running away or jumping, which feels extremely awkward) and you can't even ads with the guns. I just spent around an hour trying to kill a guy by exploiting his weaknesses but nothing would work and he'd just one shot me. So I quit. Don't think I'll be coming back to the game.;5/10;12 June 2023;0 out of 2 found this helpful.
Bethesda Game Studios;Prey;My go to game.;Very few games will I ever repeat, let alone several times. I absolutely loved this game especially for the one thing that hasn't been commented on. The sound design. Mick Gordon has injected so much atmosphere into this game it's literally scary. Don't be expecting Doom type heavy distorted guitar riffs. This is something more akin to what vangelis did for movies. The music and SFX fit together and with the game so perfectly. The gameplay and story which have already been commented on make this a great game. Mick Gordon's sound design takes this great game to being one of the best of all time. I am yet to find a game that transports my senses to another place like this one does. Playing late at nite took me back to my days of playing doom with lights off. It's been said before but this game truly is a masterpiece and much credit must go to the sound design.;10/10;18 March 2023;0 out of 1 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;Not like other ORIGINAL Counter-Strike games... Not even close...;When year 2000 there was no game like Counter-Strike... With it Graphics, SFX, game style and everything it was a revolution in multiplayer games, not in just FPS games. Imagine a game that actually is a mod of another big game but more popular... (I'm not saying better.) Counter-Strike: Source is also has amazing graphics and SFX. Most of the players don't like CSS weapon system, because it wasn't easy actually. I think Counter-Strike was better but also Source was quite good. Even if the game style doesn't suit you, you need to admit in 2004 this game was revolution too. After many years later this little improved Global Offensive came. Basically there was nothing to tell. Not even avarage graphics, SFXs are old, not even changed. This is basically just the CSS with CS weapon style with rank and online matching system. Before this game came out there was Battlefield 3 look at that, it has amazing graphics, so much better than this crap game. When the real Counter-Strike came there wasn't a Call Of Duty game. Actually 3 years later the first Call Of Duty game released. Some new-born players will say "Graphics not important in online game, you need FPS." so what about gameplay? Gameplay is also the same, not improved it just get easier. Good graphic with good optimization is possible like in CSS. We need a real Counter-Strike. Without Nexon, Hidden Path or something else. Just VALVE need to do it.;8/10;15 July 2020;4 out of 6 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;Roll in peace;This game is quite fun, and has a ton of things to do. You have casual and war games which suck in my opinion but for the competitive or casual there is a competitive mode with highly polished maps. For those looking to have a ton of fun and fool around there are hide and seek mods on the workshop, along with death run, murder, and many more game modes. The guns in the game are usually balanced and it is highly a skill base game. The skins and gloves in this game create an economy like no other game which can allow you to buy and sell skins and knifes while earning them in game.One of my favorite games and a must have for steam players;8/10;6 January 2019;2 out of 5 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;A great online game ruined by cheaters.;Counter Strike: Global Offensive aka CS:GO is a game that is the first game in my Steam Library (second being UNDEFEATED - A superhero game). It was kind of boring as well as being fun at the same time. Here are the pros as well as the cons.PROS - Great guns to use. (My favorites were the IMI Desert Eagle, Heckler & Koch G3SG/1, FN SSR, SIG-Sauer SIG556 and the AWP.) Fun gameplay. Easy possibility to get kills. (sometimes) Okay graphics. Perfect balancing between slow and fast gameplay. Good details. (Such as the movement of the player varying while holding a heavy weapons.) Good optimization. (I have an ASUS laptop with an i7 8th Gen processor and a kinda weak MX110 NVIDIA graphics card and It runs perfectly with a constant 60fps with some framedrops to the 30s or the 40s)CONS - Awful rewards. (aka cosmetic skins.) Cheaters hunting the prey in some servers (A guy in a server some day ago killed me through everything with a rifle and everytime he kills me, He points at the ground.) Possibility to get killed. Terrible and boring Battle Royale mode. Lack of weapon understanding. Boring at some places.Overall, The game is good despite having some issues I encountered. It's a great game for the weekend if you want to play competitive shooters or you are bored. I really recommend it if you like the genre.

Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;not good graphic but still fun;If anyone complains about Counter-Strike's graphics, let them know that not everyone has a high-end gaming PC and good gameplay is always a top priority. As for the shooting mechanics, I think the slightly quirky feel is part of what makes the game so fun. There can be some toxic players in the community at times, but I try to stay positive and remember that most people are just having a good time.Counter-Strike is a unique game that pits you against both enemies and teammates in a fair and balanced way. In-game skins and virtual economies may seem like tricks for Valve's benefit, but they don't affect the actual gameplay itself. When Counter-Strike first came out in the 2000s, it was the complete game that changed the world of multiplayer gaming forever. This was his mod for another popular game, but it quickly became more popular than its predecessor due to its superior graphics, sound effects, and overall gameplay. Even Counter-Strike, the 2004 follow-up, had good visuals and audio, but some players didn't enjoy the new weapon system. This game wasn't published till after a while. The introduction of rankings and the online matchmaking systems is a lovely addition, even though the graphics and sound effects are not considerably better than Counter-Strike. While some new players would think that graphics are unimportant in online games, good graphics, when self-confident, can provide a far more enjoyable experience. In this aspect, I think that Counter-Strik serves as an example of a title with top-notch graphics and responsive gameplay. In conclusion, I believe Valve should continue to make changes to Counter-Strike as it deems fit. Whether it's adding new features or simply tweaking the graphics and sound effects, there's always room for improvement. But what makes Counter-Strike special at the end of the day is that it offers hours of exciting gameplay that keeps players coming back for more.;7/10;10 March 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;80% -- Not up to the standards, but sportive and seriously funny;PROS Welcome to Counter-Strike, a world of Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists constantly at war against each other, where the one side sees bombing places as glorious and the other sees defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, and killing Terrorists as a joyous hobby, but both sides can tolerate losing allies, even if that means losing a game. Now introducing to you the newcomers, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a graphically refreshed sequel to the fan-favorite Counter-Strike: Source and the only game that turns terrorism and counter-terrorism into a tournament and has both sides trying to defeat each other not to further their cause, but as a sport. That's right, folks. Killing and bombing is a sport loved by Team Terrorists and thwarting their plans is loved by Team Counter-Terrorists. And killing each other is absolutely tolerated since both the teams do not really die anyway in the end and they all seem to be one part of a large welcoming family. The gameplay looks and sounds evidently serious, but it is all rather sportive.The basis of the game is to stop the enemy team from preventing one's objectives. Play hero or villain, rescue one of two hostages or destroy a site, but the objectives across the maps are consistent. At the start of every round, with every several-second delay, plan with your teammates and purchase guns, grenades, equipment, and bullet vests ridiculously expensive compared to real-life price tags, and always wonder like a Counter-Strike character, "Why are we always temporarily not allowed to carry out such an important mission?" When the delay is over, commence like a slow but cautious agent aware of all of his surroundings and using whatever tactic to outsmart the enemy or like a suicidal athlete hoping that the enemy is unfortunate enough to be doomed. Regardless, you only know what the enemy is doing when they are seen by a friendly player or you (as indicated on the radar-like minimap) or when they have completed the first step of carrying out an objective, and you and your team may need to change your strategy quickly. In the end, a hostage is either rescued or not, and the targeted site of the terrorists is either saved or destroyed, or more precisely, bombed but not actually damaged, as if structured for an endless number of rounds. Split up and surround, or closely cooperate, but you can always donate your teammates weapons and equipment they need with your surplus of money before or during a round. Fighting by your teammates or alone, you are always doing your side a service - unless you are helping the enemy by foolishly donating to them or constantly injuring your teammates. It is fun if the players on the server are competent and well-behaved, and it is just as fun playing with and against the artificial intelligence bots in place of the human players, which are cooperative and willing to respond to commands and calls for help, as well as give reports such as an enemy sighting and give commands themselves.In case that becomes old too quickly, find yourself in a variant of (Team) Deathmatch, which is gunning opponents for points, with kills with pistols rewarding more points and those with knives rewarding even more. Doing significant damage to enemies in that mode but having them finished off by someone else (a.k.a. assist kill) is also rewarding, albeit less so, and throughout a match, the game encourages players to kill enemies with certain weapons for bonus points each within a 30-second timespan. It stresses proficiency in the use of weapons to prove who is the winner, rather than who has the most powerful weapon. If that also becomes old, you can find yourself playing several variants of Classic Mode such as eliminating the enemy team with sniper rifles and low gravity, or you can play Arms Race, a "race" in which players start with a specified tier of submachine guns, rifles, shotguns, heavy weapons, pistols, and finally the notorious golden knife according to the player's rank and must complete the tier to win. In that mode, players must kill two enemies or one enemy with the most kills to climb up the tier to the next rank's corresponding weapon, but knifing a single enemy steals the enemy player's rank. Another mode is Co-op Strike, which is cooperative mode with all players fighting against terrorists and playing on an official or custom map with a scripted story being told as the players progress by completing a certain objective. That said, numerous stories can be told.As if all of that is not enough, like Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fan of mods - maps, skins, custom game modes - but modding is taken to a higher level with regards to weapon skins. Make your golden, futuristic, rusty, or outright peculiar, and with the numerous maps made rampantly by the community and easily available and designed, play on anything imaginable, from restaurants and starships to underwater and Mars. Add any twist to your experience for your preference, and the result insanely works.CONS The weapon mechanics, simply put, are absolutely wacky. Players can shoot through walls - e.g. wooden, glassy, and almost any material that is thin - and other players to kill their targets. They can even shoot through the head, the upper limbs and torso, the stomach, and the legs (as from above or under) to deal even more damage, all with a single bullet, and all of that is good. However, in terms of gun accuracy, recoil and character movements widen the reticle, meaning that the weapon of the carrier is rendered less accurate. I personally prefer that it be just the recoil "shaking" the screen and not affecting the reticle, but here is what is inexplicable: why does jumping widen the reticle (and thus the damage area within) for my shotguns, why is it that I aim and shoot just as accurately as I write dexterously with my left (non-dominant) hand when grabbing on ladders, and how does moving, jumping, and firing near-fast cause many weapons to have an accuracy swaying from 10° to as high as about 37° off the reticle and others of a similar type and weight to have a much better accuracy? Quite convenient and anti-sharpshooter if you ask me, and I even researched how accurate the weapons under these conditions are. Grenades are a nice aspect, but some of them are underpowered or underutilized, and with a low single-digit limit of grenades to carry to fight, the game seems to emphasize guns more than grenades and does not think much of giving players a decent handful of grenades in hand.For a game late in the series, CS:GO seems to be on the verge of running out of ideas to progress the franchise, as it could have done more than just add more game modes like Deathmatch, Arms Races, and derivatives of Classic Mode and equally rely on modded maps and game modes by the community more than their own creativity, as well as weapon skins, to really attract players of CS:S.While definitely graphically improved over CS:S, for a 2012 game still being curated as of the time of this review and even by 2012's standards, with lower-resolution textures and a slightly more polygonal look based on a 2004 engine, it demonstrates that maybe it is time to rely on newer technology. Additionally, the audio generally ensures the game's serious (yet sportive) tone, but some of it seems to make it sound cartoonish instead. e.g., why does shooting someone produce what sounds like a wooden crate of slime being sliced with an axe?CONCLUSION: CS:GO does too little to truly give Counter-Strike: Source players a reason to shift, let alone the anti-sharpshooter mechanics, but it does enough for newcomers and to turn a serious situation in-game into an e-sports tournament.SCORE: 80%;8/10;27 September 2018;0 out of 6 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;Terrible.;A barebones FPS experience full of cheaters and hackers. I don't recommend it -- go play Battlefield instead, a game that actually has depth to it.;1/10;4 August 2021;4 out of 14 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;Would give 10 if not the lag;I've wasted 6000+ hours playing this game, spent 2k+ eur for skins and stuff related to this game. I would be still playing this and maybe would have 7k+ hours already, and maybe even more money spent, oh and the rating here would be 10/10,if not the one thing - LAG AND TERRIBLE OPTIMIZATION. Well this game has terrible community and alot of cheaters, and all of those problens Valve doesnt care to take care of. Instead they are creating new skins to buy that they could make morey money,and they just dont care about the game. For that, i really wish this game stopped making so much money for them, maybe then they would do something about all those problems or even would create new counter strike game, which it feels now impossible to expect for. But all problems aside, the main thing which killed the whole fun for me was terrible optimization. Ive wasted many hours to find how to fix this outdated old engine game for both my gaming laptop and stacionary pc. Just couldnt. I had fps drops, mouse acceleration problems, mouse sensitivity changing randomly problems, screentearing and stuttering (both computer screens are 144hz,but my laptop screen was more pleasant to look at but still i felt the stuttering anyway, actually 144hz made the stuttering even more obvious). The list of optimization problems is big, i probably would use all the words limit here. So i just stopped playing. Ive sold all my skins. And valve will not get a single penny from me anymore. Exception would be new counter strike or half life (non vr) game, and that's it. Valve wake up, fix your shit and keep it together. 10+ years passed and you are still ignoring all this and making your fans angry. At least could use some anticheat but i guess that would kill even more fps and the game would crash and etc. But faceit somehow works, but i have even less fps in it than in just official matchmaking, and thats just terrible.Im going to miss the simplicity and classical looks and sounds of this game tho. I used to be an awper, sniper player in the team. Im going to miss those crazy awp flickshots i used to do back in the day, even with lags shitting the whole performance and experience.;8/10;19 May 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;CSGO is a good game.;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, also known as CSGO, is a popular first-person shooter game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in 2012, it quickly became a fan favorite and remains one of the most played games on Steam.During CSGO gameplay, two teams-the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists-compete against one another in a variety of game situations. The objectives of each game choice vary, but generally speaking, the terrorists must set off a bomb or kidnap hostages, and the counter-terrorists must prevent them.One of the key features of CSGO is its focus on tactical gameplay. Unlike other shooters, CSGO does not have health regeneration, meaning players must rely on their teammates to heal them. This encourages players to work together and communicate effectively, as well as emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategy.The game also has a steep learning curve and a high skill ceiling, rewarding players who put in the effort to grasp its mechanics. Weapon recoil, movement, and positioning are all important aspects of gameplay, and players who can perfect these abilities have a substantial advantage.Professional players and teams compete in high-stakes tournaments for sizable prize pools in the CSGO's thriving esports industry. The game has a sizable player population and an active community thanks to its popularity in esports.The game's microtransaction system, which enables players to buy cosmetic items and weapon skins, is one of its critiques. Despite the fact that these items have no impact on gaming, they have come under fire for giving the impression of gambling and encouraging addiction in some players.The matchmaking system in CSGO has also come under fire for being unfair and vulnerable to hackers and cheaters. Despite Valve's attempts to enhance the system, many players continue to report matchmaking problems.Despite these criticisms, CSGO remains a popular game with a devoted fan group. Its tactical gameplay, high skill ceiling, and E-sports scene make it a favorite among competitive players, while its community features and regular updates keep it popular.From the last update, CSGO is free to play game (Original game about 300 THB). They made one of the most popular FPS games on Steam free in order to include the PRIME expansion, which enables players to play against no hackers, which is complete nonsense.This only applies to prior CSGO owners. As we all know, prime was necessary for using the smartphone authenticator, so anyone could do it for free. They now charge for that and make the game free, so they didn't make anything free but simply increased the price to appreciate the game more.CSGO is an all-around well-designed, entertaining shooter that provides an unique and satisfying gameplay experience. Serious players love it for its tactical gameplay, high skill ceiling, and competitive element, and its community features and regular updates help it keep a devoted following. Even though it has flaws, CSGO is still a timeless game that any fan of first-person shooters should play.;9/10;9 March 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;One of the best FPS games;Counter Strike is a very good FPS game, and continues to outperform even the latest ones despite being released almost a decade ago. Unlike similar games such as Valorant, Overwatch etc, anyone can get the same enjoyment out of playing CS:GO, regardless of playing ability. For example, there are many game modes available for new players such as training and playing against bots, and you can play LAN games without being restricted to a minimum of 5/6 players. Additionally, there is the ability to play on custom maps created by the community, rather than being tied down to the default maps and the games eventually becoming quite generic.However, CS:GO can sometimes feel quite repetitive, especially after playing for several hours - personally I think there should be more game modes available.Overall CS:GO remains one of the best FPS games and I would recommend it.;9/10;15 April 2022;0 out of 2 found this helpful.
Valve;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;Oh, guys;Worst one on the whole Counter-Strike franchise. This game has a way more aggressive focusing on tricks, like hearing footsteps (cannot be done without headphones which is s little cheating) or shooting physics. Let me explain: there's no special skills needed to play well in Counter-Strike: Source with any type of weapon cause any weapon shoots well. But here the developers thought it's not interesting and they downgraded it so you need to re-learn or even re-understand it. That's stupid especially while nerds are playing with AWP only and there's no chance you could kill them. Here's how the matchmaking works, you always will get similar or lower level players in your team, but the opposite team will be stronger, why? There's no answer! Why VAC cannot spot wallhackers? No answer, again. But there's a lot of wallhackers buying clear accounts with prime to terrorize people. What about drop? No drop on non-prime accounts. And It's not random as everyone thinks! The game just decides to throw a case or a skin to you or not, but it's not random. I hope Hidden Path Entertainment will become bankrupt soon and Valve will never colaborate with similar studios to create games!;1/10;31 January 2022;2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Valve;Dota 2;A game that I have put over 2000+ hours into so far.;A few times a year this game will have a new update or patch that balances out the heroes again so the best heroes aren't always the best at all times so it keeps people on their toes in a sense.This is a game that heavily requires team work. Without map awareness or a decent level of communication, games can easily become frustrating experiences. To help with this however, when you first start off you'll be up against opponents that are hopefully as equally clueless as you are. This is thanks to the MMR or what is known as the ELO system (if you're a chess player) this game has.To battle against this potential issue, I suggest that you start off with the human vs bots game mode first. I'd suggest to try every single hero at least one time before you go into a public match. If you have a slight idea how each hero operates, you won't be totally off guard once you enter a public or what many consider to be a real match of Dota 2.If you encounter toxic team mates, you should mute them and attempt to not let it affect you. If they continue being even more toxic by intentionally throwing the game or getting you killed, then you should use the report function to report them. If they receive enough reports from other players as well, they'll be thrown into low priority match making where they'll have to suffer there until they win between 3 to 5 games.If you find a great group of friends to play with regularly, this game can be very fun and very rewarding. You should be sure to practice each possible role. If you're forced to play hard support all the time for example, you will probably start to grow some resentment towards the role. When you solo queue or find a match alone, that's your main chance to go out of your comfort zone and try out new roles. As long as it's not ranked, it's not a big deal if your decision causes your team to lose because you have to try new things in real world situations anyway at some point. Just please, do not try crazy untested strategies in ranked matches unless you have a good idea what you're trying to do. Your team mates have a good chance to be ultra angry if they lose in ranked due to your actions. Again, it doesn't matter since it is just a game after all. It's just polite to test out questionable strategies outside of ranked match making.So yeah, this was a long review. I love this game. It has issues sometimes but what game doesn't? You start off with all the heroes for free which is over 100+ heroes. The only things that cost money in this game are in game tickets to watch the professional players play and if you want to buy cosmetic items for the game such as hero costume pieces.My rating is a 9/10. Try it!;9/10;19 May 2016;8 out of 9 found this helpful.

Valve;Dota 2;My experience when I started playing Dota 2.;Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually incompetently by millions of enslaved passionate fans Russians worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes carries, forming two teams of five players five feeders. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare raging in an unknown language and team fighting with one RAMPAGE victor.Irresistibly colourful on the surface addictive, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity which requires, no, in fact takes an infinite amount of your life away. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike that allow players to screw with their allies and get their teams killed. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow Dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience Russia, so that the rest of the world can experience the same core game-play, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world.Get a taste of the game that has enthralled millions will happily teach you fluent Russian all for the sweet price of $0.NOTE: Original description by Valve, edited by myself.;10/10;2 February 2015;4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The protagonist is voiced by none other than Sasuke, wielding a sword and dealing justice to some amazingly animated dragons. For the first few episodes, it is epic. Then, a second, mostly unrelated, story takes center stage. It is convoluted, poorly written, and once unfolded, actually seems kind of dumb.

Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;The best VR game on the market.;VR has always felt a bit like a gimmick. Despite being a massive supporter of the platform, most VR exclusives are simple games, even the best ones such as beat saber or blade and sorcery. These are both fantastic games but they don't quite have the drawing factor that something like a call of duty or assassin's creed. Enter Half Life: Alyx. Since 2007 the idea of half life 3 has been a bit of a meme and whilst this may not be that game, it's incredible to finally have a new half life game. And not only is it a new game but it is the next half life game, a full fledged triple A title. On VR. Exclusively. Valve have released an incredible game that really shows that any game can work in VR and that the platform has just as much potential as the PS5.

Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;Novel, unique and groundbreaking...but VR still has a long way to go.;Should you invest in this game? ...will probably be the first question anyone has about "Alyx". The game itself is first rate, very much worth playing, and a worthy addition to the "Half-life" series. But there is only one way to play it, and it requires VR goggles. Consider that even modestly-priced VR (Virtual reality) goggles are at least $500 (Oculus Quest is the one I bought) with Valve's VR goggles offering being almost twice that. And after having played the game, the answer to the question "Is it worth it?" is really yes and no and depends, unfortunately, on how much discretionary income is available to you for buying the goggles since you cannot play "Half-life Alyx" without them.Not to put too fine a point on it, but the most important question really might be this, Is VR c. 2020, really worth the expense? Considering what you pay ($500 and up, although almost certainly we can assume that cheaper used VR goggles will become available before too much longer) vs what you get (the VR experience c. 2020) - my answer would have to be no! My reason for this is because, while VR is certainly novel and new, it is not revolutionary enough to be worth causing yourself financial hardship to get it.And if at all possible, do try VR goggles before you buy a set. The visual effect of VR really needs to be experienced to answer the question for yourself. And I repeat, the truth is VR right now is really nothing revolutionary. It's basically just optical trickery, which is fine, except I'd describe the effect as not too different from the old time 3D movies from the 1950's. These 3d movies required you to wear some paper glasses with red tinted plastic over one eye and blue over the other. And VR goggles are really not too different from old-time 3D. By showing one eye one perspective and your other eye a different one, and your grey matter does the rest. The result is certainly a noticeable visual effect, which makes it different from every other game you've played up to now - but paying the freight to get it may not be worth it to you.There are plenty of images on line that will show you a very good representation of the 3D minus the goggles, and if anything the effect is kind of like watching the game action through a piece of glass a foot away, with more action happening 10 to 20 more feet away, in other words, two perspectives at once. The feeling of actual depth is there at times, it is interesting to see, and it does make gameplay more interesting. But the interface you have with the hand controllers is of necessity very slow. Navigating through this virtual world is awkward and clumsy. You cannot react quickly to anything in the game, and so almost everything that happens gives you plenty of time to react. This removes a lot of the tension from the gameplay but is probably unavoidable.So whether this game + VR goggles is worth it to you, is something only you can answer. By the end of the game I did not feel cheated or disappointed, but just wanting more. It's obvious Valve left out a lot of stuff - landscapes, visual effects, et. al. that will surely be there when they finally come out with "Half life 3" (they have not announced it yet but the mere existence of this prequel game basically confirms HL3 beyond much doubt). I thought about this game for several months before actually getting the Oculus Quest to play it, I had modest expectations that were mostly met by this game. But if you're on the fence about it, and $500 will make a significant hardship for you, I'd tend towards the answer being NO! My reasons for that, beyond the high cost, is that virtual reality still has a very long way to go. Maybe in 5 to 10 years they will finally have something truly groundbreaking instead of 1950's 3D. But as of 2020, they are still a long, long away from anything truly revolutionary in the optics field.;9/10;25 November 2020;6 out of 16 found this helpful.
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;This game takes 2020's VR tech to the maximum-but VR technology is still not ready for primetime!;I thought long and hard before I purchased "Alyx" and that's because it requires a VR headset to play. I did not buy Valve's VR goggles, I bought Oculus Quest for $600, and it works just fine to play this game. But this review is about the GAME, after all, and what a marvelous game it is!Once you get used to your VR headset, plus the clunky hand controllers that work along with it, you're in for some really good gameplay. Being a huge fan of Half life and HL2 + expansions, it didn't take long playing to realize this fits right in with the older versions, and even improves on them in a few ways, naturally. "Alyx" is a worthy addition to the Half-life series, and one can only hope that Valve is well into Half-life 3 (since the mere existence of "Alyx" basically implies that game too, will eventually get made).The game starts you off in a dirty balcony, presumably somewhere in City 17, where you will presumably gain some familiarity with using your goggles and hand controls by doing some easy stuff: moving cans around, picking things up, opening doors etc. Then the tasks get progressively more complex along the way. The game design is quite well thought out, especially since every action requires using the awkward hand controls. And knowing this the devs designed the game to mostly NOT require you to do anything in a hurry. Most actions are done at a leisurely pace because its pretty much required. There are several moments in the game that did require speed of movement, and those are the ones i had to repeat over and over just because I kept getting killed. I never did get truly comfortable with the hand controllers not even by game's end.And that's another thing I have to mention, is the length of the game - it is just too short! It's really not much longer than an HL2 expansion pack. And I could have gone for a lot more game, alas -What I really want to discuss is, VR technology as it exists c. 2023. Considering the relatively large outlay for the game plus the VR goggles, I was rather disappointed. VR tech right now is really not much better than the effect you would get just by watching an old-time 3D movie, using those old cardboard blue/red glasses. The VR effect given by "Alyx" is certainly interesting to see, and it is novel and new.But for the large outlay just buying all the stuff, I felt like it should have been a lot better than it was.I didn't expect to put on the VR goggles and suddenly feel like I was living in "Avatar", but I was hoping it would be a whole lot more realistic than it actually was. perhaps a better sense of depth, being able to see off to the sides a bit, SOME THING mind-blowing...but no, it was just the old "creature from the Black lagoon in 3D" effect from the 1950's updated for the 2020's.Ultimately I did not feel cheated, scammed, or let down too much by this game and I'd play it all over again (in fact it's almost a bit of a waste if you don't replay at least once). But IF you have to put yourself in a financial bind just to play Alyx, I say, DON'T. Save your money until VR improves a whole lot, or at least until the price of all of it comes down!;9/10;28 January 2023;0 out of 1 found this helpful.
Valve;Half-Life: Alyx;VR should be an additional feature not a MUST;The game itself is good and it still does what HL2 did best which is great world design that had great atmosphere with really good sound effects and soundtracks.Graphically it's outdated, but the lightning and level design is so good it makes it look more realistic even though the graphic itself not holding up.Gunplay is nothing special at all. Many games does it a lot better when it comes to gun sounds and the feeling of shooting em.The game does not bring anything revolutionary after all these years. It keeps itself to the original and playing it safe.I'am just honest and telling how it is. No fanboying or anything.All n all its really fun and a great adventure thanks to the world design its really good. I also like old school FPS games with different maps more than openworld like we see today.I give it a 6 mostly because of VR. Not everyone have the money for VR and I had to burrow it from a friend. Also take to account that people with glasses can't wear VR they have to get lenses. They just made the game very hard to be accessed by anyone who owns a PC because of the VR choice.UNACCEPTABLE! Its a slap in the face and a big middle finger to every fan of the series.People should not be giving this game such high score and accepting how dirty valve is.;6/10;5 May 2023;0 out of 4 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Brilliant!;Years ago, when Valve launched Portal as a fun Half-Life 2 mod, everybody was thrilled with the concept of the game. Portal 2 didn't just live up to the expectations I had, it slammed them harder into the ground, than I could have ever imagined. If this is no game of the year, I don't know what is... Portal 2's plot reaches much deeper into the history of Aperture Science, revealing new characters and shining a light on the events of Portal 1. Of course the humor most certainly made it to Portal 2 and I want to say, this game is even funnier than its predecessor. The new characters and the deeper plot make this game a must-buy, but that's not good enough for Aperture Science, I mean Valve: A co-op mode was the only thing missing from Portal 1, and they included it in this gem of video games. Challenging test chambers and hours of brain explosions await you and your partner in the Aperture Science Co-Operative Testing Initiative. If you liked Portal, you'll love Portal 2. And if you've never played Portal... do it now!;10/10;23 April 2011;47 out of 47 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;We are not worthy! We are not worthy!;They have done it again. After Portal, which was more of a fun game teaser really, they have finally made the concept into one hell of a game.First of all, it now has the proper length of a full game (6-8 hours for the single player campaign on your first run). Secondly, the creative puzzle solving from the first part is not only back, but improved with many new gadgets that make you wonder how they come up with that stuff. Find me more creative game play in the industry, I dare you.The single player campaign is now filled with even more hilarious dialog and characters (the old ones are back of course), a better story line and what i thought to be a jaw dropping finale. That's the scale the concept is made for, well done! The game now features a co-op version where you go through a different set of levels which you can only solve through teamwork. Those will puzzle you even more than the single player campaign (in total the game is about 3 times as long as the original by the way). Before they send you out to places where you have to really rely on your partner to, say, not fall into the abyss, they send you through a course of team building exercises so you can get used to how things work now that you're not alone any more. Extremely well thought out. Solving those puzzles is even more gratifying when you do it as a team, or so i have found.Last but not least a little shout out to the group of actors voicing the various characters in the game. Good voice acting is something we have come to expect from Valve games but those guys and gals really know how to deliver comedy. At point I had to stop playing for a minute to wait for the laughing to stop .-) How often do sequels let you down. Not this one. It's longer, bigger, funnier. Now you will see why the people at Valve took so long to make it. Instead of rushing the game and get something half finished *cough* Dragon Age 2 *cough*, they took their time to get it right.Hats off, Valve, hats off.;10/10;26 April 2011;25 out of 28 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Hilarious, engaging, intelligent and brilliantly scripted and cast – just a joy to play;It was only recently that I discovered what has been public knowledge for a long time – that Portal is a great game. I decided to jump into Portal 2 recently on the basis of enjoying the first game so much. True to form, Portal 2 does not disappoint and everything good about the first game is present, polished and improved here – well, pretty much everything.The game begins the same as the first one did, with levels that introduce you to the world of portals gradually so that you get the basics before the puzzles start getting a bit harder. This is normal with sequels because the makers cannot assume players are familiar already but at the same time have to try not to bore old hands who have seen this all before. Here there is no such problem because while I was already familiar with the ideas I was being introduced to, I was not familiar with Wheatley. At first Wheatley (voiced by Stephen Merchant) is your guide and he is hilarious and he makes the introductory levels a lot of fun to play with his comments and advice: this is a game that tells you which button is "jump" by getting you to push in to "speak" and then judging your character for jumping. It is hard to describe but fans of the first game will know the style of humour at play here and indeed fans of Stephen Merchant should also know, since he is doing his usual stuff here (most notably like he did in Extras – the cheerful numpty).The single player game takes you through the same sort of test rooms as before but plot developments see you exploring different areas in the facility as well. These areas tend to be more broken down and the differences in them does serve to rather break you out of autopilot to a point. At times it is too easy to solve puzzles by simply observing the room and recognising the process rather than solving the puzzle, the change in location made me have to pay attention more. Also in addition to the varied locations we also have substances added which have particular properties and play a role in solving puzzles – these also serve to break up the "routine" of knowing where to put the portals and makes for some nice puzzles. There are also laser and other new things but rest assured that the trusty companion cubes remain. I still didn't find it particularly hard but I do think it was a little tougher at times than the first game – the makers said the focus was to make the game bigger but not necessarily harder and they did do that.Of course bigger does make it better and I think the single player game was about 10 hours which, considering it is very similar throughout, it is testament to how engaging it is that it never gets boring. The story helps as we have great characters in GlaDOS, Wheatley and Cave Johnson, all of whom are really well written and hilarious but yet also charm and engage – they can be tragic, threatening, cruel or insane but the player always likes them and is entertained by them – like the turrets, even when they are trying to kill you, you always feel bad about knocking them over! The dialogue is key in making this work and it is really well written. Johnson's dialogue is funny and also informative in terms of back-story, while GlaDOS is as evil as ever harbouring a massive grudge from the last game and constantly making lots of little digs at the player about their weight or about their parents not loving them. Again, it is hard to explain how funny it is but my girlfriend (a hater of video games) loved watching me play – although was always impatient for me to solve the puzzle so she could get the next piece of dialogue from GlaDOS etc. It is hilarious and it is this way throughout – the final song is not quite up to the standards of "Still Alive" but to be fair – what is? The delivery of the lines is near-perfect. McLain returns as GlaDOS and various other voices, while JK Simmons (yes, Schillinger from Oz etc) is really great as Cave Johnson. Standout though is the cheerful little bumbler Wheatley as played by Merchant. A great character and Merchant totally fits, delivering by far the funniest performance I have seen him give.The graphics are not amazingly stepped up from the original game but some of the areas outside of the testing rooms are impressive in their complexity and detail. However those looking to be wowed by technology will not be here but in fairness it isn't what I came for and it did still look good. The addition of the co-op may only add another 4 or 5 hours to the game but they are great addition. The use of four portals and two players means that the dynamics are really well changed and they worked my brain a little harder because I had settled into a rhythm with the main game. It also features a nice little plot and loads of the usual humour.Overall Portal 2 is a brilliant game. The puzzles are good without being really difficult – I still found it a bit too easy to solve but many did give me pause and made me think for a minute before sorting it out. The humour is key though and this game is hilarious and engaging at the same time. The characters are brilliant in the writing, the dialogue and the delivery and I have (and will) replay parts just to hear the lines again. A great game – clever, engaging, funny, exciting and with twists and turns in the plot. Buy it now.;Not Informed;5 June 2011;14 out of 15 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;for science...;"You are now thinking in portals..." - this used to be the tag line for an underdog game-project which completed the Orange Box. While most of the people bought this product because of Half Life 2 - Episode 2 the main feature only had limited playtime. After exploring the game set of the the Orange Box players were stunned by "Portal", an ego-shooter with no shooting and parallels to the Half Life universe.In fact it was only a matter of time until the huge testing facility of Aperture Science got revived for the next run - and story.While Portal 1 was pretty much done within 3 hours its successor waits with 7-8 hours of fun. It appears a little short - that's where the co-op mode comes in, adding almost a new dimension to the game's paradigm. Solving puzzles, mazes and riddles with a partner not only opens up possibilities of creating problems to solve - it also enhances one's horizon of thinking. The co-op mode does not really develop a story, but just for the fact that after solving some puzzles ("tests") the player is left with an unique impression, this games deserves a huge credit.The story picks up where its predecessor left off - but digs way deeper into the history and structures around Aperture Science. It's a delight to move through very different environments solving unique puzzles which are created with a particular love for details. After some rooms the player occasionally feels like a genius because the presentation of problems are extremely unusual. The voices you are accompanied by dramatically raise the level atmosphere as the voice actors do (typical for Valve) an exceptional job. The whole flow of the game grants a fluid game-play and hardly ever comes to halt.To me personally the main point of praise is the fact that Valve manages to send you through approximately 8 hours of the same game-play without making it boring. The story is appealing, unique and weaves in seamlessly into the Half Life universe.Two things that I thought were not quite state of the art: 1. The graphics engine is out of date, no doubt. For this game it isn't THAT important to have the latest graphics, still it's very apparent at some point and very untypical for Valve. 2. Many aspects are almost too familiar from part one. The showdown, the credits, some monologues and game-plays, etc...BUT, some other aspects would receive more than just 10 points and that's why Portal 2 still deserves a solid score of 9 points.Let's face it: Valve produces games which are far more than the average assembly-line-games pumped out every year. The love for detail, interaction, presentation of problems, dialogs, story and game-play clearly stands out in comparison to even major game developer studios. And Portal 2 continues this tradition seamlessly - yes, I may have expected "a little" more but in the end it's still another magnum opus which will be talked about for a long time. No doubt, this game is already one of 2011's highlights and even though other games have way better effects, graphics, models or realism - Valve draws a very clear line: While other studios produce games, they craft art!;9/10;27 April 2011;12 out of 13 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Portal 2 is Still Alive!;Portal 2 is the much anticipated follow-up to 2007's Portal which Valve released as an extra game on their Orange Box compilation. Although short, Portal's innovative game-play and memorable cast captivated players and made it a runaway hit. Calling Portal 2 a sequel would only be partially correct since the first game was more of an appetizer with Portal 2 being the main course. Does Portal 2 live up to the expectations? Let's take a closer look and find out.Portal introduced us to our silent protagonist Chell and her fight to escape the deserted Aperture Science facility controlled by the insane AI GLaDOS armed only with her portal gun. Portal 2 picks up roughly 300 years after the first game where Chell has been recaptured and placed in cryo-storage and is woken up by Personality Core Wheatly so that they can escape the run-down facility before the reactor core melts down. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact. The voice acting in the game remains top-notch. Ellen McLain returns as the voice of GLaDOS and as the voice of the polite and cheerful attack turrets. Joining the cast are Stephen Merchant who gives hilarious life to Wheatley and the always entertaining J. K. Simmons features as the voice of Cave Johnson, the eccentric founder of Aperture Science.The game-play from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers (or Thermal Discouragement Beams if you prefer). Additions to the game-play include the propulsion and repulsion gels (in keeping with the Portal color motif they are orange and blue respectively) which do pretty much as they describe either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyor beams with portals as well. Perhaps one of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 however is the inclusion of co-op game-play. Co-op game-play gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player. Good communication is vital to success however, and the co-op interface has several helpful tools to communicate with your partner including a small pop-up window to see their viewpoint though you may want to use a microphone as well. Portal 2 even features a commentary mode (a returning feature from the first game) where you can play through the game with speech bubbles placed throughout the levels which, when activated, trigger audio files of various production members discussing the creation of the game often relative to where the player happens to be at the time. This feature really shows off the amount of effort that went into creating this game.In general the game-play is challenging, but never really frustrating. The game does a good enough job of teaching players the basic mechanics as new elements are introduced that even newcomers will be able to pick up the nuances of the game fairly quickly but has enough challenge to it that even veteran Portal players won't be able to just breeze through it. Some of the achievements/trophies are centered around players having to solver certain puzzles either in quick fashion or in different ways then they normally would. Exploration and experimentation is highly encouraged in game. In short, there is plenty of content to keep veteran Portal players on their heels and dazzle newcomers with all the possibilities.Visually Portal 2 holds up pretty well considering it's running on Valve's somewhat dated Source engine. The environments are much more expansive and dynamic than in the first Portal and the visuals are much sharper. Some may lament the change from the cold and sterile look of the test chambers from the first game, the change in style suit's the story well. While it may not quite hold up to some contemporary major releases, it is by no stretch of the imagination ugly. The background score does a good job of reinforcing the tension and isolation of the game's story. All this really comes together to bring an enjoyable experience to the player. Portal 2 delivers in all aspects. Fun and challenging game-play, engaging characters, and the ability to play with friends make this a can't miss title, unless your only system is the Wii, in which case you're out of luck.;10/10;24 July 2011;5 out of 5 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Tops Its Predecessor In Every Way;Portal was an already excellent puzzle game. Portal 2 however expands everything from the first game and makes it eleven times better. The puzzles are bigger, the stakes are bigger, the Enrichment Center is bigger. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.Chell has been kept in stasis for a long time since the first game ended and is awoken when a tiny personality core named Wheatley tries to break them out of the facility. Chell and Wheatley pass through a few test chambers before accidentally reawakening GLaDOS, who has many more tests for you. You have to get out of the facility and finally escape GLaDOS and Aperture Laboratories... at least at first.Portal 2 is one of the most fun games I've played all year. The puzzles have the same basic formula of portal shooting as the last game but there's a lot other stuff thrown in as well. New gels that propel you and increase your speed and a lot harder puzzles that will keep you guessing.Not only does Portal 2 increase the puzzles, it also goes deep into character development. When you go deeper into the facility you find out the truth about Aperture's origins and also the origins of GLaDOS. Portal 2 is one of the best games of the year. If you haven't played it, I strongly suggest it. You'll laugh, you'll get frustrated, and you will be heavily engrossed in this amazing game.;10/10;2 January 2012;10 out of 12 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Exceeded my expectations;I never expected a sequel to the first-person puzzle-game Portal to be any good, but they actually managed to create a very well-produced game that relies on great voice-acting and creative level-design. Its clear that Valve is pushing their aging Source-engine to the limits with Portal 2, but they still manage to create some of the best looking levels I've seen in a good while. The game involves a more active story-line then in the first game, but it never distracts too much from the brain-twisting puzzles. And yes, the puzzles are harder then in the first game in my opinion, although they are never near impossible if you know where to look and pay attention to the level. It also features more levels then the original I think. The first Portal took me only a few hours to beat, while Portal 2 took me two days.A couple of new elements are introduced this time around, to keep the game refreshing and preventing the levels of getting too predictable. This is done in the form of different gels (liquid substances that either make you jump high, or run fast on contact). There's also a white gel that allows you to shoot portals on whatever surface it is spilled on. Regular water allows you to wash either one of the gels off. Besides that, there are also light-bridges that allows you to portal a walkable bridge to otherwise unreachable places, and some kind of anti-gravity beam that propels either you or objects like turrets and boxes into the direction it faces (which can sometimes be altered by pressing a button in the room).Last thing I have to mention is the music. The music ingame, as well as the ending-music (which was particularly popular in the first game) called 'Want You Gone' by Jonathan Coulton are great. It all fits the game's robotic atmosphere perfectly as well as the ingame glitch-beats that you can hear mostly when the action intensifies.As you can already make out, Portal 2 allows for some very diverse puzzle-elements, and this together with the already established portal-gun makes it a lot of fun and challenge to play. The story isn't too exciting, but the witty humour and overall superb voice-acting makes it worth while (kudos to Stephen Merchant for providing his voice-talent for such a funny villain). Its a bit early to say with such a long time ahead of us, but I wouldn't be surprised if Portal 2 would end up on many people's lists of best games of 2011. Go play it, you won't be disappointed!Now, if Valve Software would only get some information out the door regarding Half-Life 3, I would be their number one fan!;9/10;7 May 2011;8 out of 10 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Portal's unique puzzle-solving gameplay is remarkably upgraded in Portal 2.;Portal 2 is an unique game, as It's successful predecessor. It's filled with incredibly clever puzzles. And it has a fantastic story, with unforgettable moments. It's cleverly done in singleplayer, but the multiplayer co-op is even better, because, having a partner when you solve puzzles is rewarding, and enjoyable at the same time. Visually is nothing special, but Source Engine did It's job very well, and the soundtrack is great. The voice acting is extremely good. The replay value may not be very high, but with a great plot, enjoyable puzzles, outstanding character and a fantastic co-op, there's probably a reason to come back and to play. I recommend this game to everyone, especially the people who love puzzle games!;10/10;28 October 2012;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Thinking With Portals;"Aha!" that is the word you will be saying most to yourself as you progress through Portal 2's nine chapters in the single player campaign. These test chambers or individual puzzles you progress through are so cleverly designed, that once your about to give up you find the perfect piece of information you were missing in order to solve the puzzle.The game starts off as you awake from suspended animation, several hundred years after the events of the first game. You play as the same silent protagonist "Chell", and are broken out of containment from an artificial personality core named "Wheatley" in an attempt to escape the Aperture Science facility while accidentally awaking GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System), the chief antagonist of the franchise in the process. Eventually your put through another series of test chambers but things take an interesting turn in the second act which I won't spoil.The gameplay from the first installment remains mostly the same with developer Valve adding several new elements to freshen things up. First off, the art style has changed with the setting of the Aperture Science Facility having been dilapidated for so many years. Overgrown vegetation and ruined architecture freshen up the scene as well. Tools such as Repulsion and Propulsion gels, Excursion funnels, Aerial Faith Plates, Thermal Discouragement Beams add a new level of complexity to the puzzles, but the development team does a really great job of introducing you to these new elements, allowing you to master them before they hand you a new thing to play with. It's all great fun!Graphics wise, the eleven year old source engine that the game is powered on continues to be updated with some great lighting effects and animations with a mostly steady frame rate, but the loading zones should definitely be trimmed, especially for a game this late into the console life cycle. The audio work is fantastic helped by the hilarious dialogue voiced by Stephen Merchant, Ellen McLain and J.K. Simmons. This is truly the funniest game I've ever played!The game is well worth its sixty dollar retail price with an equally long two player Co-operative mode (which wasn't available at the time of this review due to PlayStation Network being down) and developer commentary throughout the single player story mode. The PlayStation 3 version (which I recommend over the Xbox 360 version) comes with Valve's SteamWorks support, a popular service on computers which allows for cloud saving and automatic updates not previously available on consoles. Two people are able to play with each other cross-platform from the PS3 over to PC or Mac, which is a fun bonus.The take away from this experience is the atmosphere of the world you are re-introduced to. The game trains you in solving puzzles based on the physics of forward momentum allowing you to walk away from this game feeling smarter than before. The themes of isolation and science as a main priority above all else, are minor messages scrolled into the background, similar to the environmental storytelling you will find written on the wall of the game world, in one of the best games of this year.Rating: A;10/10;9 July 2012;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Challenging, funny, non violent!;After playing Call of Duty, Homefront, and other first person shooters, I got very bored with video games. Portal 2 changes that boringness. First off, Portal 2 has no violence besides a little bit of red when you get shot by a robot. Other than that, no shooting "guns" and no killing. Instead of weapons, you use wits. The puzzles start off easy in the beginning, but as the game progresses, it gets difficult, but without getting you aggravated. You can explore easter eggs, secrets, and other ways to solve puzzles. The story is great, and there are some pretty surprising character developments throughout the story. Graphics are 100% amazing. It gives you a rusty, beaten down feel, which is what the developer's goal was. Add in the non stop humor said by several characters, and you got yourself a game! 10/10 for me, and the best video game in a while!;10/10;26 April 2011;8 out of 11 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Starts high and keeps soaring;Chell wakes up again, albeit in different(yet the same setting, and this time, we get to explore far more of it, and learn its rich and bizarre history, at the hands of Cave Johnson(Simmons as the charming and... let's go with "eccentric", science-enthusiastic and not entirely responsible-minded CEO)) circumstances than last time, and learns that GLaDOS(McLain, with her snarky wit, though not without other emotion or expression) was not completely destroyed. In the time passed, the area has fallen into disrepair, adding "color" to the neat, Spartan look of the original, and with plant-life having spread. With the... help(?) of your new buddy Wheatley(Merchant as a nervous, not-too-bright Hugh Grant-ish British Personality Core that you carry, insert into machines, etc.), she is accidentally re-awakened, ready to attack you with petty insults. Oh, and, y'know, by forcing you through brand new Test Chambers. Those, too. She also starts bringing the facility back to its prime, and we get to see how vast it is. How will you take her down?Thus, this directly follows the first one, retells what happened in it and also trains you in the mechanics again. You can start with this one, and some will favor that. It can be, and has been, said that the first was a prototype, not a "full game". Due to its success, the decision was made to give it the treatment of such, with this full-scale sequel. More happens, the "behind the scenes" areas are expanded upon(those can get confusing and harder to find your way through, with their, shall we say, "outside of the box" design), there are characters(all with separate personalities to them, they're explored by being placed in different situations, and it's usually one-on-one relationships), dialog, plot twists, everything is properly set up and paid off on, it all moves fast and it's tremendously well-written and, yes, hilarious(without losing drama and threat). From the few aspects, such as "no safety" and "personal remarks", they come up with a ton of inspired material(and the occasional bit that falls flat). With these additions, the isolation and loneliness is no longer so present. One wouldn't have thought they could accomplish it from the 2007 one, and this is more than a little impressive.One of the most worthwhile parts of this is the co-op. With its own plot, tougher(!) puzzles that require co-ordination(you both have the "gun", and you'll need all four "gateways"!), communication(aided by pin-point signals available to both, sharing view with the other person and, of course, full support for voice chat) and skill(it's the best of its kind, and that is not something I say lightly. satisfying, genuinely collaborative... if you and a friend want to play through something, make it this. You can thank me later), the two(customizable!) characters of Atlas and P-Body that both very clearly belong in this universe(one is the egg-shaped sentry body, both with Battle Droid style legs and arms. a running gag is their easy reassembly, making "death" a very temporary setback, allowing higher complexity), it's compelling throughout. It stores your progress, down to which specific area you got to. Off-line split-screen is possible. It ties into SP, without knowledge of either being necessary to appreciate the other. Nothing will be spoiled by the order in which you complete them, or even whether you only get through one of them.This builds on the base already set, going bigger. Of course the titular invention wouldn't be enough to sustain the full length - that is, 7 hours for single-player and 7 and a half for online. Light bridges, air funnels, different types(speed, jump, etc.) of gels(rendered using amazing fluid dynamics) etc. All of these can of course interact with each other, and the teleportation Portals(their outlines are visible through walls and obstacles). You get tutorials for all, which does lead to a number of linear, one-solution portions. The minimalist look peals back(via panels instead of tiles, allowing for more variety, making the world feel alive(it reacts organically to you), and whenever they aren't seen to move at all, it feels like something is now "missing") to reveal a much grander scope, and the state of the place is rendered gorgeously, with some forest having grown on/around it, and you can see far beyond the edge of some areas because of holes in walls and the like. This is polished, extensively tested.The graphics, as already suggested, are great. Water is realistically rendered using technology also used for Left 4 Dead 2. This thankfully does away with the infuriating "look reset"! There is some eerie mood, sometimes replacing jokes - it would be excessive if it was constantly making you laugh. The hints at a post-apocalyptic world outside, and we can guess and theorize about the time(when did the 1st one take place? How long has passed since then?). I hear that it's answered elsewhere. I prefer to think about it for myself. Every so often, this gives you a break(with "experiences") from puzzle-solving, advancing what's going on and letting you recharge, and this leads to a number of unforgettable moments. This comes with a level editor(for both modes) and the option of sharing them with anyone, anywhere, and the leaderboards add a competitive edge.This comes with an interesting developer commentary, a cool comic(read any time, it doesn't give anything away), the trailers for this and an interactive(!) teaser for Super 8 - why aren't more movies advertised like this?! If I wasn't fairly thoroughly inoculated(Lost went off the rails with the mysteries, in Mission Impossible III he channeled the wrong "strong female protagonist" show(Felicity rather than Alias), and it appears that his ST is too action-driven) against J.J.(his Star Wars might still be good... right? What's with the blank stare?) by now, I'd be there! There is a lot of darkly comical disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys brain-teasers and has hand-to-eye coordination, yes, that's whether you're a gamer or not. 9/10;9/10;10 January 2014;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Valve's Final Masterpiece;This game is truly magnificent. The game's atmosphere is amazing. Valve really nailed the mysterious abandoned laboratory feel this time around. They knew they couldn't just rehash Portal, so they tried something new and it really paid off. The puzzles are fun and challenging, but not infuriating, and the way that the game chooses not to have any cut scenes breaking up the game play makes the game much more immersive. It's easy to get lost in this game for hours. The story is wonderful, and the ending is powerful. I would highly recommend this game to anybody who likes puzzle games, story telling in games, or games in general.;10/10;24 December 2018;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;GLaD I played it;The first Portal game did a decent job showcasing the potential of it's core mechanics whilst also doing some fun things with its worldbuilding. Portal 2 expands upon it's predecessor in every possible way and fully utilizes the groundwork that the first game laid down. The strong kit of new mechanics makes for more elaborate and at the same time more fun puzzles.Also the game is really funny. The new characters are very entertaining and paired with the old faces from Portal 1 we've got a small but an extremely well developed and likeable cast. The interactions between GLaDOS and Wheatley had me laughing out loud all the time.The visual gags and dark humor make this game ooze with so much personality and it is just really fun to go through well crafted puzzles while a killer robot monologues about something stupid.;9/10;31 July 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Surpassed The First One!;The first entry in the Portal franchise was neat in all aspects, and the second entry is just as neat, only its even better. Everything that they added made an already neat game even better. The dialog is really funny and the plot is more engaging than in the first game. The characters are given some meaning and the simple story is wonderfully wrapped up in a very satisfying ending. The gameplay was as amazing than in the earlier game but there are a few things that made it even better. The fact that there is a solo story mode and a co-op story mode that each have two completely different stories is very nice. Both gameplays and stories are very good in both of these modes. I also really enjoyed the community made maps and the possibility to create your own.To quickly summarize, Portal 2 is an amazing game that even surpasses its predecessor. Both gameplay and story and highly enjoyable. If ever, you've played Portal but haven't played Portal 2 I hurge you to do so. And if you havent played the first one, you should play it to see if you want to play this one too. I consider this game to be perfect, and so its one of the best games ever made.;10/10;4 June 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Valve;Portal 2;Informatic Pop Culture that amuse any Geek;Confronting yourself with machine is hard. But what then when are the machine who elaborate rooms to entertain human brain activities and the machine yearn to see you treated as a laboratory pet? This is the game and the plot that the boys of Valve pictured in one of the most stimulating puzzle game ever produced. If you have appreciated the culture of retro games and Half-life you will find a peacing sequence of both astonishing and relaxing time. A must have;10/10;18 November 2019;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;Groovy...;Three or four weeks after the outbreak began(depending on the source you go by), the optimistic rescue attempt(the government's response increases over the course of this) leaves some standing on the rooftop, looking at the helicopters flying away, and realize they have to take things into their own hands. Nick(a gambler and small-time hustler), Ellis(chatty and upbeat young mechanic), Rochelle(low-level employee of local TV station) and Coach(overweight African-American who trains high school football) will have to make their way from Savannah, Georgia to New Orleans(this really captures the flavor of The South, in aforementioned characters who have personality without being obnoxious, the fast-paced if lighter score, the areas, etc.) in search of a safe place to stay.They will move through a carnival(clowns! Honk their noses, take 'em out to stop their squeaky shoes from attracting more!), swamp, a deep forest(did I mention that this has some levels that take place during daytime? This creates a stronger contrast between the brightly lit outdoors and the pitch black deepest inside areas - plus, running around, with the undead around, in the sun? That's just plain creepy), a mall, a cemetery(much bigger than the other one, and it's too obvious to not do... sure, they don't unearth themselves, still), a huge cornfield(look above to spot a sign on a building to see if you're even going the right way!), small towns, and, where the FX enhance the atmosphere, with the slight increase in continuity and/or story not locking it in place(the AI Director 2.0 will keep you guessing, changing things like weather, objects and paths depending on what you are or aren't doing, it still feels alive and is endlessly replayable), rather making it have an impact - Hard Rain is a *journey*, as you make your way from a vehicle, to gather gas, and all the way back, as the downpour grows terrifyingly, hampering visibility and even making it difficult to hear if danger is near. And right where they start? Atop a hotel. Which is partially on fire. Smoke obscures the view, flames block the path as debris did before.In total we have 7 new campaigns, for half to a full hour per, with 3-5 parts each. The 6 of the original return, and with all the new content and variety, this won't wear out its welcome anytime soon. I don't know why not all 20 Survival(and that can now be played with a team controlling the Smoker, Hunter, etc.! Swap places, beat the other guys' time) stages return... only 4, from The Sacrifice and No Mercy(so not even all of them), and they're joined by 13 new. The one new mode has 16 total, 9 for this and 7 from the '07 ones(not just the same): Scavenge. Gather the 21 gas cans and fill the generator. Timed, so don't dawdle, and if too long passes with you not getting further, that's it. The other team will have tried to prevent you from getting them all, and will have to top your score, however high or low, to win. This is distinct from regular Vs. - everything in this complements, fits, doesn't replace and doesn't rehash - in that there's always a rush, it's in a single small area, and that camping is not an option.In fact, that does seem to be a priority with this, preventing that, the death of all creative approaches to online shooters. The aforementioned is also present in regular play, as one of the two new crescendo event types - refuel something or otherwise transport one or more items from one place to another before you can proceed, with the final one being the Gauntlet, where you have to get from points A to B - and you'd better be ready, because it's a relatively tight corridor, it's far, and you have to keep moving(once you get there, it has either the end, or the button to turn off an alarm that keeps luring foes in). These make it vital to take an active part in these climax-like portions, and one that, like when making your way forward in general, may be unique. how many will transport the important thing(which prevents whoever is carrying one from attacking... and if dropped, they are volatile, this is gasoline we're talking about), how many, if any, will cover them? And if you're almost there, should you turn back to help if needed, or come back after securing victory?Further keeping you on your feet when taking on the role of one of the humans are the three new Special Infected, all of them filling niches and mending holes in their side's tactics. The Spitter has a projectile that does splash damage, has good range and who won't be immobilized from using it. Don't stand so close to me! That goes for The Charger, as well - a faster, less armored version of The Tank, he'll bowl right through all four of them, sending them in different directions, grabbing one, and rushing further, until he hits a vertical surface. Or goes right off an edge(if he doesn't, he'll pound the one he got into the ground until they die, or he does, at the hand of the others). The Jockey steers the person he's on the back of away, and possibly into something that'll hurt 'em... like one of the many, and no longer always stationary, Witches.While the arsenal is made up mostly of the same kinds, each now has at least two within that(all useful, yet with different stats), and you're more likely to find a replacement gun than additional ammo. Save your bullets, or lose, if you have, a laser sight or incendiary/explosive clip? You can replace your pistol with a mêlée weapon(like a chainsaw!), with instant-kills in an arc in front of you.There is constant detailed, bloody, disturbing gore and violent content in this. I recommend it to anyone who's ever enjoyed a post-apocalyptic zombie concept. 9/10;9/10;19 June 2013;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;Eight years old and still beloved;Left 4 Dead 2 is a game that most people have at least heard of in their life time. Released back in 2009, this game still remains highly popular, eight years later, and is still one of the most loved zombie apocalypse games on the market. After playing a few games, it's not hard to see why.After being new to this game on PC, having played it on Xbox for quite some years, it was a different experience coming onto it and having to relearn controls. But with L4D2, there's something about it that stops people feeling brand new, and you learn quickly. Even playing with my friends who are basically pros at the game, having put thousands of hours each into it, felt like I was just another guy with tons of hours. It's user friendly, and not hard to get used to.There's so many different game modes in this that allows you to go through and do pretty much whatever you want in the game, there's a mode for almost anything. Of course, I wouldn't recommend playing multiplayer as a new player, with no friends. The online community are absolutely horrendous when it comes to new players, and are definitely the kind of people who kick others just for being new. It's a shame that a game that's so amazing has such a horrible community behind it.But really, that's the only con about the game. The game itself is amazing, with brilliant graphics, an awesome soundtrack and really good movement and controls. The only downside, is the community. Definitely grab this, grab some friends, and make a night out of it.;9/10;8 September 2017;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;One of the funnest games ever made;This is one of the most entertaining games ever made, especially online versus mode. But even single-player is fun.Zombies are never in the same place when you re-play a map, so the game always changes and never gets boring. You never know exactly where zombies are going to be.This game is just a blast to play because it is so chaotic. There are also a lot of different weapons in the game. The 4 playable characters are all very different from each other and entertaining.The best campaigns are Dead Center and Dark Carnival, in my opinion.One of the best games ever made. 9/10.;9/10;12 November 2021;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;Can You Survive the Zombie Apocalypse...Again?;Left 4 Dead 2 is set one week after Left 4 Dead 1. In it, four strangers named Nick (a gambler and conman), Rochelle (A news producer), Coach (A health teacher and coach), and Ellis (a mechanic) team up to survive an outbreak of the "Green Flu" which causes people to behave like zombies (the Infected). There isn't just one type of Infected though. Here is all of them: 1. The Smoker- An Infected with a long tongue that can snatch survivors from a distance and constrict them.2. The Boomer- A bloated Infected that can puke a bile on the survivors and attract a horde of Infected.3. The Hunter- A hooded Infected that leaps long and high to pounce survivors and claw them to death.4. The Tank- The biggest and baddest of the Infected that simply attacks with its strength and throws debris at the survivors.5. The Spitter- This Infected spits and acid-goo that rules out the possibility of corner camping during crescendo events and if you stand in it too long it will kill you.6. The Jockey- This Infected jumps on a survivor's head an steers them into danger.7. The Charger- Another large Infected that charges at a survivor and pummels them into the ground.8. The Witch- A crying Infected that if startled, will attack the Survivors.9. The Common Infected- These are the normal Infected that you fight that will travel in "hordes".10. The Uncommon Infected- These are types of Infected you only see on one map. They usually have varied abilities. For example: the Clowns on Dark Carnival attract hordes with their squeaky shoes.The game is very fun with large improvements over the previous title. The game now has melee weapons to kill the Infected and a lot more guns. The variety of the maps is interesting and they are all connected, unlike the original Left 4 Dead.The game is also more challenging. The bots aren't as good as they were in the first game is my only problem. Sometimes they will let you die or try to kill a Charger with pistols LOL. But overall the game is better than the first (which was my favorite game until I bought this one).The multi-player is good. There is a new Scavenge mode, as well as a Realism mode, a versus mode and normal coop. Here is a breakdown of how the multi-player modes work: 1. Coop- Just you and a friend teaming up with two bots to survive a campaign.2. Versus- A team of survivors trying to make it to rescue while a team of player controlled Infected tries to stop them.3. Scavenge- The Survivor team tries to collect gas tanks to fuel up the rescue vehicle while the Infected team tries to kill them all before they can or cause as many gas drops as possible.4. Realism- This mode is the same as campaigns except that you can't see the Survivor Halos (this causes you to have to stay together), the Witch can kill you instantly and the common/uncommon Infected take less damage to the body and cause you to have to shoot them in the head.The only game types I've played are coop, Realism, Versus and the normal campaign. The Realism mode is a nice tough. Very challenging and causes you to work together more to survive, it makes the game feel less like 28 Days Later and more like the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead.The game is great. I highly recommend it to fans of the first game.10/10;10/10;27 November 2009;16 out of 17 found this helpful.
Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;Great continuation of the L4D series;Left 4 Dead 2 is brilliant. The game's many additions such as new weapons, new infected types, daylight campaigns and more varied scenery really spice up the format of Left 4 Dead. To me, the original now seems fairly bland and boring with its exclusively night-time maps and only a very small number of weapons.I feel the two best campaigns in the game are Dark Carnival and Hard Rain. Dark Carnival takes the survivors through an abandoned theme park. You'll be running from infected hordes through a Tunnel-of-Love and along a roller-coaster track. There's also an achievement for carrying a garden gnome through the entire campaign and the finale is fantastic.Hard Rain sees the survivors' boat run out of fuel, forcing them to disembark and head to a gas station for a fill-up. They then have to make a return journey, which means that if the players use up all the safe room health packs on the way, they won't have any left on the way back.Hard Rain gets its namesake from the dynamic weather effects it features. At any moment, a storm could roll in, reducing visibility significantly and making the survivors sitting ducks for special infected attacks. It also means that, on the return journey, much of the route will be flooded, slowing the survivors down and making them use alternate paths.The other campaigns are excellent as well, and there is a running story arc throughout them, unlike in the original game. The only problem with this is that, due to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer format, there is no real ending sound-off to the story, although the last finale of the game is by far the hardest.Left 4 Dead 2 takes Left 4 Dead's award-winning format and improves on it tenfold. Anyone who liked Left 4 Dead, or likes shooters in general, should definitely give this one a go.;10/10;5 December 2009;10 out of 13 found this helpful.

Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;5 Stars out of 5 Stars;It was probably only a year after I got the first left 4 dead before I got left 4 dead 2 for my birthday(?) or maybe my brother bought it. don't entirely remember. I just remembered that this game was a complete upgrade from the original through and through, with some kickass new zombies to kill, (like the jockey for example) some improved graphics, and even cooler, creepier levels to complete. The story is about as weak as the first game, but there's enough narrative to keep me invested. Gameplay is the biggest feat here. It's also a nostalgic experience for me, even probably moreso than the first game because my brother, are childhood friends, and cousins used to play this with us. countless days and nights wasted playing this awesome, gruesome game. Definitely one of the best zombie games I've ever played.;10/10;24 April 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;Massive zombie action.;Woohoo! Take all of zombie films and take the good old FPS action element and you got this game. It's a pretty good game. I have only played singleplayer mode, and I have enjoyed enough. Now, this game is pretty, compared to the movies, pretty colorful, it has nice graphics, interesting AI and tense action. You can choose between four characters. They are not special in their own way, that's too bad, I expected that each of them have something special, some special move, or combo, something like that, but no, they are just based upon some usual characters from the zombie movies that joins together to fight their way through the zombie filled terrain. The only thing different is weapons UZIs, shotguns, handguns, melee weapons, now these are cool, you have katana, or chainsaw for example. You just pick your character and go shoot some zombies. Now, the zombies are pretty good here, they are attacking in packs, of course, but, they are not slow, oh no. They move slowly, until they see you, then, they start running at you and slap you crazy. They are not typical slow zombies, but fast paced, kill-you zombies. Not just that, but you also have special zombies that have special abilities, for example you have Charger, a large, mutated zombie that runs like nuts and crushing everything in their path, you also have Smokers, Spiters, Jockeys, Hunters, Boomers, pretty much pain in the neck all of them, and two more very, very specials the Tank, a very large mutated zombie, more stronger than Charger and a Witch now that's an unusual character, but she is the most dangerous, when she jumps, she will claw you to the ground. Now the gameplay is pretty simple on moments, but on some occasions, it can be pain in the neck, especially with these special zombies, but overall, it's fun. The levels are good, a pre-apocalyptic ambient of deserted villages, small towns, hotels, malls If you 're watching "Walking Dead" for example, and you enjoy it, well you'll enjoy this too.;7/10;26 July 2013;1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Valve;Left 4 Dead 2;Not bad- but not 10 stars...;This game is pretty good. There are a lot of things I like about it, and a lot of things I don't like. I mean, no game is perfect.One thing i immediately notice is the game is harder than the first one. I understand that Valve is going for the whole "teamwork" thing, but Easy mode is harder than normal mode on the first one. Not so great if you don't play online, like me. Yes, i have played online a bunch of times, but if it's not with my friends, I hate it. People are jerks online and ruin the fun.I like how they kept the same weapons as in the first one, but all the new weapons are pretty much the same as the old ones. The grenade launcher really isn't as great as people say it is- but fun nonetheless. I like the Boomer bile, but that's the only new thing you can pick up and throw in the game. I wish they came up with other stuff to go along with the cocktails, pipe bombs, gas cans, gas tanks, and O2 tanks. the same stuff as in the first one.A major problem I have with the game are the glitches and crashes. A few times a night the game will lose the connection with steam. Reading reviews, i am not the only person to experience this. Also, there are a bunch of glitches- like on the rooftop in the finale of "Hard Rain," where parts of the roof are missing, so it looks like pipe bombs, etc. are floating in mid air. Again, another issue people are facing with this game- at least for the PC.I am not a huge fan of the characters. I liked the characters in the first one much better.A few of the campaigns were boring. "Swamp fever" was the same thing every time you left the safe room. Hard rain is kind of half a campaign. I do like that they added more to the levels than in the first, however. But, like in the Carnival for example, they could have added so much more cool stuff- I mean, you're in a carnival and you can play 2 games and walk on a roller coaster. the tunnel of love was horrible because it just went on forever and it was all the same thing.You can definitely tell Valve rushed this game- they even admitted it. They say that they are working on fixing the problems with the first game, but they have been saying that for almost 3 months now.I am a huge fan of melee weapons. They are pretty fun. Wish there were more of them. The only one I don't like is the cricket bat.But all in all, it's still a really fun game, but I definitely would not give it 10 stars- I think 10 stars is just foolish because it doesn't deserve 10 stars. If Left 4 Dead 1 did not exist, I'd give it a 9- but because it's the sequel, and they really didn't jazz it up as much as they could have, I give it an 8. I feel as though they should have spent more time on it. I guess that's the reason why Valve usually does take a long time to release a game.I give it an 8 because it's a good game, but because L4D1 exists, i can't give it more than an 8. L4D1 gets a 9 from me because it's just a better game. Giving it a 10 is kind of a tad much.;9/10;26 December 2009;1 out of 15 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;To Live or To Die In Los Santos;Greetings from Lithuania.To say "Grand Theft Auto V" (2013) is an amazing experience in (almost) every possible way is like to say nothing. This game is pure and simple masterpiece.I won't say anything new that wasn't said millions times before. GTA V is a must own and play for almost anyone who enjoys perfect games. You have like literally and open world in which you can do anything, and everything is done so good, so great. I beat this game on PS4, and to be honest the control at the beginning felt awkward, but its just like for 5,6 hours - then you will get use to them and it will be just awesome. And there couple more minuses (story mode) - i didn't find any purpose for your crews skill levels - there aren't many heists in the story itself (or maybe i missed something). And other thing is sometimes very frustrating controls of the characters when you there is action is some very closed space, thankfully there weren't many of those. And the last thing is a targeting system when you are in a car flying on some 120 km/h - good luck in to shooting some specific targets. That said, GTA 5 is almost perfect. The story narrative, screenplay, acting, voice acting, directing and whole craftsmanship is the best there can be. And i even just started to scratch the surface of GTA Online. Overall - one of the very best ever.;10/10;29 December 2016;30 out of 32 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;I thought it was overrated until I played it;After I joined college I started playing PC games, and that was the time I began learning about gaming outside of Nintendo. Open world games were something that really fascinated me, so that was the genre I started from. I played Assassin's Creed and Watch_Dogs, but I didn't understand why normies liked GTA so much. I thought it must be because they don't know about bigger ad cooler games, until I tried GTA V myself. And I have to say, boy was I so wrong! This really is something unique, something I couldn't get in any other open world AAA game I had played to that point.GTA V is something I'd call the era defining game of our time. It has everything we want: A good story, interesting characters, a dynamic open world, interactive NPCs and most importantly, it can run on any device (other than Nintendo and mobile phones). I have a habit of playing games linearly, that is, going from point A to point B. I only care about the story of a game and explore the open world only after I complete the main story mode, so that I can delete the game in case my laptop starts going slow (it's an Nvidia 940MX), and also because I have too many unplayed games in my library and I'd choose to finish them rather than look at a game whose story I've already completed.And that made it even more engaging. because the story is really gripping and funny at the same time. In the beginning I was annoyed when Michael was shown the first time, putting his gun on Franklin's head. But after Michael's family left him I was really interested in knowing how he will fix things back. But then the scene shifted to Trevor. I was really annoyed, and I would always shift to Michael to finish his quests. But after I replayed the game after it became free on Epic, I realised Trevor's story was the funniest of them all. Now Trevor has become my favourite character of the three.The graphics are really realistic. And the best part is, if you have a high end PC you can download mods to make the game look as realistic as possible. There are even mods for bringing your own characters like Superman or Hulk, and the best part is that Rockstar, unlike other AAA companies (read Nintendo) encourages players to do it rather than punish them for the same. The NPCs are also very interactive. They behave just like how any person in real life would. Being an indie game developer myself I know how much effort goes behind doing this.Just by looking at GTA V you can see how much love the developers poured into making it. The game has been available for every console from the 7th generation and will also be for the 9th generation. Gaming companies should learn from Rockstar and take this example for their games too (especially Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed II would have been so awesome if it was remastered for PS5 and Xbox Series X). I really hope GTA VI is able to outperform this game. They can take as much time as they want, I have no problem with it.;10/10;11 July 2021;20 out of 21 found this helpful.

Circumstances lead to the pair to have to do a job to pay off a debt – a job which gets national coverage and draws unwanted attention from a former partner, corrupt cops, ruthless movie moguls, rival gangs, aggressive fitness fanatics and many others.I have played this game series on and off over the years but (criminally) did not play the former one based in Los Santos but instead rejoined with GTA4, a game I enjoyed but not one without its flaws. The good news with V is that the game keeps the strengths of the fourth game but makes many improvements which produce a much more fun and enjoyable experience across many aspects. The first thing to say is that the world of LS is technically amazing in terms of its attention to detail and beauty – it is hard to describe to people who decide they do not like these games, but to see a glorious sunset from a hillside, with perfect shadow effects and vegetation movement and know that someone designed and made this, not just filmed it, is something that hit me over and over throughout the game. The map is enjoyably large with diverse landscapes and character and I still find great pleasure in just going around in it even if I have nothing specific to do.The story is solid enough for the game even if it is rather generic and overblown. The characters are quite clichéd in some regards. Michael's story for instance is not so imaginative and generally I found him the least of the characters. Franklin is similar but covered by him being the "intro" character, so I stayed close to him throughout. Trevor is a wonderfully violent and funny character and his entrance is memorable and really shakes the game up. The events of the story are necessarily overblown but this is part of the fun and generally I liked the flow to it. The many supporting characters are great fun and the energy and color of it all does cover up for the fact that the story is not really that complex or engaging at times. As it is though, it is about events and set-pieces and the game provides plenty of fun memorable missions (admittedly as well as a handful of awful ones), and in this way there are loads of missions to replay and enjoy and, most importantly, this game actually allows you to load them to do just that.Side missions add color and fun and, although I do miss ongoing missions like the vigilante ones from IV, there is still plenty to do. The range of vehicles adds to this and I also enjoyed how much easier they are to drive than in the previous game. Weapon customization and the range of them provide fun destruction, although the police are a lot more aggressive in this game than in IV, so it is harder to go on a rampage and make it last. In theory the Online world offers endless gaming – I tried it for one evening and it was fun despite all the issues, but the community seemed messed up and very reliant on having an existing group of players – it looks fun but I'm just more of an offline player these days.Grand Theft Auto V is a great game, even if you "only" play the days and days of content in the single player game. Technically the game is astounding with its attention to detail and just the sheer beauty of the audio and visual design of the whole world. The plot is solid enough to do the job while the characters (main and supporting) are colorful enough to engage while playing through missions which are mostly enjoyable and offer plenty of big set-pieces that are overblown and fun.;Not Informed;13 December 2013;23 out of 25 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Outstanding, Rockstar you've done it again!;One of the most highly anticipated games we have seen ever and it has not disappointed. I have been a fan since the very first GTA entered my console a number of years ago and have played them ever since with great enjoyment and GTA 5 just tops the rest. From the characters to the amazing graphics it is easily the best game I have ever played, after playing The Last Of Us I didn't think the graphics could be topped but they have and then some. With the selection of 3 characters to play it adds that little bit more fun and you get a more in depth view of the person you're playing, and of course GTA would not be the same without the crazy dialogue and damn right funny events that happen.Borrow,Beg,(don't steal) and get yourself a copy. 10/10;10/10;17 September 2013;80 out of 99 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;The gold in Rockstar's mine.;This game is absolutely beautiful, even the most minimum detail in the game is amazing. Rockstar has carved a beautiful sculpture over the last years. The beautiful storyline, graphics, characters, EVERYTHING. Now GTA not only has 1 as said before, but 3 characters, Franklin is struggling the life in the hood with his home Lamar Davis, while also fighting The Ballas. Michael is a retired bank robber and a father of 2 kids, James De Santa, and Tracey De Santa, with her wife Amanda. Trevor is a psycho trying to sell drugs and nuclear weapons to the Chinese. They will team up to: Steal banks, work for the FIB, hang out, and more! Also I can honestly say. This game, is one of the MOST detailed game since Red Dead Redemtion. The weather effects, dynamic events, Strangers and Freaks, and ACTIVITIES! But also there are a lot of COOL Easter eggs. BUY THIS GAME NOW!10/10;10/10;26 December 2013;42 out of 50 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;This has to be the best game I've ever played!;I just want to start off with this: BUY THIS GAME! This is just brilliant with beautiful graphics and great, fun, and hilarious characters. By reading the other reviews I'd think that they really love this game too. My favorite characters are all of them. I think they all have great stories and fun to play with. The cars are really fast and awesome! The weapons are awesome! Everything is just amazing. My favorite part of the map would have to be the beach. I just love going there and stealing bikes and making Chop chew on civilians! I would like to finish this by telling you to tell your friends about this and buy this game now!;10/10;20 September 2013;62 out of 80 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Game of the year, 2013.;The Grand Theft auto series is a juggernaut of everything - Money, Fun, Controversy, Sex, drugs, the works. But us fans of the series would not have it any other way. every time, Rockstar always hits the jackpot.In this 5th installment of the series, Protagonist Michael De Santa is a retired criminal who committed a series of heists and bank robberies in his past, and has retired to a more desired life up in the hills with his family. But not all is as it seems. His wife is more attracted to the young tennis coach and the yoga instructor, his daughter puts herself out like a prostitute, and his son is an overweight Generation Y bum who doesn't work, but has plenty of time to smoke weed and insult other gamers on FPS games. He himself is miserable, drinking during the day and starting arguments over nothing.But not only is Michael a protagonist, so is his old friend Trevor, a maniacal redneck who lives to cause chaos and anarchy, but making money in the process by selling crack and arms. But to Trevor, Michael might as well be an angel, because Trevor is a real maniac.The last protagonist is franklin, a streetwise hustler who repos cars in a time of economic uncertainty, as well as deal with his homies in the hood as well as his strange aunt.I want to review this game, piece by Piece Story 6/5 I'm sorry, but this game's story is just so complex and amazing that you can't help but think rockstar went the extra mile. they did an amazing job, and it shows. No matter what kind of hero you like, this game gives you 3 choices. Me, personally? I like playing as Michael or Trevor, but franklin just isn't my kind of guy. There's one mission early in the game where Michael does yoga, and it's probably the most boring mission yet, but the other crazy missions and moments in the game more than make up for it.Gameplay 5/5 This game's gameplay is almost perfect, albeit a few skips in the framerate when things get hot. other than that, good cars spawn often enough (Much like in 2002's Vice city) and car customization is great. You can also buy clothes and do haircuts for the characters, but some are limited, like Trevor, who can only have a mullet and a bushman beard as special haircuts.there are lots of fun additions to the game, like animals and scuba diving. so if you're a sadistic maniac and love hurting animals (which look like they were copy and pasted right from Red Dead Redemption) or maybe you're an aquaphile and want to go for a swim, this game has lots to offer. look around and see what you may find.And oh yeah, this is the first GTA game that gives you 3 different characters to pick from. So switch between characters and check out what they're all up to at the moment.Music 4/5 This is the first grand theft auto game in which rockstar has created an original soundtrack, giving it a red dead redemption feel during missions where tension runs high. Hearing a fast paced techno tune while running away from the police is always a good time.The game's OST is actually the weakest link in the chain, as a majority of tracks will not appeal to the game's main fans. There's no lack of pop music, With Britney Spears and Rihanna (Niko Bellic: Hooray.) but a big lack of thrash metal. That's where thrash originated, and that's where it should at least have a station! The game at least doesn't have Taylor Swift. Thank God.There's a classic Punk Rock Station and a classic country station, which in it's Advertisements, claim that modern country is full of sissies and crybabies. I could not agree more. Controls 5/5 The game's engine is the same as GTA IV, but with a few improvements. these ones take time to get used to, but once you do, just hit the gas and go crazy. the fighting mechanics are the same, but this time, you don't have to scroll through your weapons like in IV. This time, you can pull an RDR and bring up a weapon wheel, and pick your gun from an array of choices.Overall - 10/10I think this game will get Game of the year from whatever awards show gives those out. with 4 years of development, a $265,000,000 budget, and a massive storyline which will take a while to get through, there will be no shortage of fun for those who play it.;10/10;19 September 2013;51 out of 68 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Best Game Ever Made, Grand Theft Auto V is incredible.;Anyone who gives this less 9, there is really something wrong with that person, seriously. The great soundtrack, "multiplayer", many customization options, controversial missions and lots of mini, complex places, amazing graphics, the actual contemporary story and pretty much everything its just beautiful. Being honest, since Grand Theft Auto San Andreas I haven't been this satisfied/happy for a video game and worth it. The faults in the system aren't reason enough to hate the game. I've actually spent dozens of hours with Grand Theft Auto V, and I definitely plan to continue. GTA Online in one word: perfection, your ambitions are the limit and basically you can do whatever you want. I can't wait to see whats next with Rockstar and of curse the actualizations of the game.;10/10;14 July 2014;32 out of 43 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;An Honest Review;I wasn't playing video games when IV came around, and... if it weren't for COVID I wouldn't have picked them up again, at least not new ones.But COVID hit so... XBox. And GTA V, honestly took me for a loop when I started off playing three different people, then ended up playing Franklin, only to switch to someone different. It was jarring and erratic, and I just wanted to follow one character and stay with them...... until Trevor came in and... HYSTERICAL.The world pops more than San Andreas did, it pops almost the same way that Vice City popped. The music is fun, there are more variety to the stations.... but the talk radio lacks the humor of the previous installments and you really don't have that wait to open up other parts of the city that seems to you clung to, hoping that the next mission would be the one that gave you a little more of the world to explore.But over all, it is a heck of a lot of fun. It's entertaining. It's rich, the story is funny and brutal at the same time and the characters are.... well, they are all characters.Couple that with the heist movie feel and it's a solid winner.;10/10;4 November 2020;9 out of 11 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Amazing and awful.;The single-player story mode: 10/10The online multiplayer mode: 1/10The online in this game managed to derail this company's approach to DLC entirely. Remember Undead Nightmare for Red Dead Redemption, and Ballad of Gay Tony on GTA IV? Yeah, we'll probably never get DLCs like that from this company ever again. From now on it's going to be all about adding cosmetics and vehicles in the hopes of people saying screw it and buying in-game currency with real money instead of playing the purposely dull and repetitive missions with tiny payouts.;7/10;4 August 2021;16 out of 25 found this helpful.

I had also spent a few hundred thousands of dollars and hours producing the cargo. How do they expect me to do these missions when I can't use an invite only session while doing these missions?

Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;The Best Game I Ever Owned That I Don't Wanna Stop Playing!;I been Playing Grand Theft Auto since the Series was first out. Its been like in my whole life. But Grand Theft Auto V, Is an Awesome, Hilarious, and Shocking Game I have ever Played. First of all, The Graphics are Amazing. The every bit of details on the characters is outstanding. The Graphics of the City, so Realistic. Now, The Story is Excellent. I found myself Laughing, Sad, And sometimes very shocked. The story has a good plot and and nice characters to begin with. The Intro, Best Intro in the GTA Series Ever. The Freemode is fun. You always have something to do. Its Fun and Exciting. Now, GTA Online is the Best Online Yet. You can Freemode in Online and drive around the Los Santos or Sandy Shores. I like that you can customize your own Character. The Non-Stop fun doing missions and Buying House or Pimping your Ride. You can Have Non-Stop Fun in this Game. Grand Theft Auto V is a Very Fun and Excellent Game Worth Buying. Thats why I give it 10/10.;10/10;12 October 2013;26 out of 41 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Grand Theft Auto V;Probably the most disappointing game of all time;Anyone who gives this game a 10/10 is either insane, is being paid by Rockstar, is about 12 years old or has never played any other game before. It is without doubt the most disappointing game of all time and a 6/10 at absolute best and the scores the 'critics' have given it just proves the fact that they are not worth reading.Good - Not very much, but the 3 characters are well designed and the map itself is adequate in size. The overall gameplay is solid and there is definitely some fun to be had with some of the set piece missions standing out in particular.Bad - Where to start? No ambient hiests, severe, almost criminal lack of interiors, no character progression, development or empire building of any kind, unable to buy houses, unable to enter owned businesses (lack of interiors!), awful, awful story, only around 30% of the map is actually used for anything useful, the friend 'like' % has been ditched so doing any activity with any other character is pointless, the girlfriend system is awful, unfinished concepts (Trevors meth business) and in general just terrible design decisions everywhere. There is a total lack of anything meaningful to do in this game. I mean its all well and good being able to play golf but where are things like dealing etc that can be used to run a criminal empire? Verdict - The most overrated, over-hyped game ever made which is a shame because it could, and should have been great. If you like driving around aimlessly with the option to play a pointless minigame this could be the game for you. If you have a brain though, you will be left bitterly disappointed by an average game thats a 6/10 (generous) and one of the worst games in the GTa series, FACT.;6/10;18 May 2015;12 out of 32 found this helpful.

If you're willing to put in the time then you will absolutely 100% love this game and if not I recognize it's not for everyone and enjoy whatever else you play.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;You live this game, not play it.;Rdr2 is an experience, as it's more than just a video game. It's like being in one long Oscar winning movie. Script, acting, storyline are immense, it's quite unbelievable really. You are living as a cowboy day in day out eating, bathing, sleeping, everything in a huge openworld. Action aside this is a great story, it's a prequel to RdR1. It has a massive amount of missions and side missions. I played the game for literally several weeks doing missions or just doing what I wanted it was an incredible experience and that is what this is, an experience. A word of warning it does start of very slow, the initial missions you don't feel free at all but when that snow goes the game really begins and you won't look back. One piece of advice whilst you are playing the early chapters, appreciate it. This story does eventually end and you maybe very sorry and even very sad when it does.;10/10;5 March 2021;128 out of 131 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Best game Ive ever played;This game is nearly perfect in every way. Graphics are gorgeous, from ever muscle in the horses as they move, to every blade of grass. The attention to detail is absolutely crazy. Walking in town you may see 2 dogs playing. Fishing? You might look across the river and see a grizzly grabbing his dinner. Its the tiny details like this that add zero to the game, but helps immerse you in the world of Arthur. The story is fantastic. It has touching moments, humor, suspense. If you had someone watching as you play the game, I can almost guarantee they'll want to know what happens next. The characters are multi-dimensional. Almost no one is completely evil or completely good. They are each layered and the most honest adaptation of people Ive ever seen in a game. The acting is absolutely the best of any game, hands down. Thats one thing that will ruin a great game for me, if the voice acting is lazy and uninspired. The actors in this game are the best, from Arthur to a minor character you might meet once, to a background character in the saloon. The gameplay? Wow. Smooth as can be. Sure there are some glitches here and there but for a game this size there are shockingly few. I can see why we had to wait nearly 10 years for this. Its a masterpiece. Rockstar earned every penny of the $100 I paid for this. I keep hoping for DLC, another chapter, anything for storymode. Even another Nightmare game would be welcomed.;10/10;8 September 2019;120 out of 126 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Game of the Year;Rockstar Games has 100% out done themselves this time. The controls are phenomenal, the story is reminiscent of GTA V's story, "one last job and we can be done forever". This game is worthy of GOTY and hopefully it wins that. For those saying that the "controls are too clunky", "you have to fight like the devs planned", stop playing because it's not like that at all. The controls again are perf- BEYOND perfect. 10/10 would play the story again. Arthur Morgan is now my new top #1 favorite game character.;10/10;3 November 2018;211 out of 232 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;True Masterpiece;This game reminds me of a scene in movie Matrix were Neo is told Matrix cannot be explained but you needs to be seen to understand it. RDR2 is a game no matter how much explained or how many reviews you read it cannot be explained but you need to play it and see it in action to understand that this is not your regular AAA game, anyone who plays games and knows anything about gaming would know straight away that everything rockstar has claimed is true, 8 years in the making is not a joke. Couple of people here have left negative reviews, I just want to say to them you should carry on playing games on your mobile phones or handheld devices because you have no idea about gaming and stop pretending to be gaming experts. Only a moron of the highest level can give this true masterpiece a 1 out of 10. To all the lovers of gaming I hope you all appreciate and love this game as much as i am, this game will be remembered for many years, games coming in the future will be compared to this game for a very long time.;10/10;28 October 2018;109 out of 132 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;God bless Rockstar!!;Coming up with a masterpiece like this could have only been possible for Rockstar. I have absolutely no words to describe this game. Everything is on point. Story, gameplay, graphics, characters, dialogues, pacing, etc. are just perfect! Everything has been paid attention to. This is definitely the most realistic game ever!!The character of Arthur Morgan has been brilliantly written. His bonding with his fellow gang members especially with Dutch Van der Linde is unique. I also love the bonding between other gang members. Dutch's speeches are very deep and thought provoking!!Being an outlaw has never felt so beautiful!! Although it's a game, it feels more like a movie that is playable. It makes you feel physically present in the wild west. Cheers to Rockstar for bringing the wild west back to life in such a wonderful way!I think this game along with God of War will go down as 2 of the greatest games in the history of videogames. With RDR2, Rockstar has established itself as the no.1 game studio!! God bless Rockstar!!;10/10;17 November 2018;60 out of 71 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Overrated;I feel most reviews of this game came out too quickly after shock and awe of the incredible graphics, animations and physics this game has to offer. But clunky and sometimes down right horrible controls, the typical cliché and worn out Rockstar formula to mission design, stupid cartoon characters and story telling seems to be scuffed under the carpet.I too was amazed by how the world looked, and that everything flowed with smooth framerate either you were in a busy town or in a deep forest. You can see mountains hundreds miles away and knowing that you can go there without loading times feels amazing.But we must not forget, we also could do all this in RDR1, which came out 8 years ago. Also in similiar Rockstar titles suck as GTA4. Games who also looked amazing when they were released.Think of it as a RDR1, only with steroids. You can do a ton of more stuff here, all from cleaning your weapons, to personalize them down the the color, metal type, length of barrel. You get the picture. This game is all about details: you can be rude to towns folk, or nice to them. Rob them. Threaten them. Beat them up. Kill them. You name it. And the way they react to you are realistic and very varied. It's rarely you ever hear a person say the same thing twice. And finally the wanted system is more realistic now: Do a crime unseen and you have to wait for another NPC to see the corpse, then run to the law, then the law will come and inspect the surrounding area. If you are seen you can lie and say you had nothing to do with it and they let you go. But if you return to the crime scene after, and the law is still there they will arrest you for suspicious behaviour. It's quite deep and now it's more fun to run around robbing and looting people.But sadly, it plays just like any other Rockstar game: The covering system is slow and clunky just like in GTA 4. The shooting also feels excactly the same. And you can forget about trying to play this without auto aiming. I tried free aim, but the controls are either way too sensitive or way to slow at times. I tried to set it up as good as the game allowed me to with removing deadzone and tweaking the sensitivy. No matter what I did it feels almost impossible to aim what you are looking at. I had no trouble doing this in RDR1 since I played it in hardcore mode, so I wonder what the hell happened? Maybe it's the PS4's controller who is the issue?But is not the only thing that stands in the way of gameplay and cause irritations: You can set up what weapons your character wants to use. You can carry a limited amount of weapons, the rest is in your horse's saddle. So let say you want to carry a shotgun, rifle and two pistols. Well for some reason after some time. after a mission or if you are killed or restarts a save, you have to set up all this again. It's quite tedious and time consuming. Also numerous time I pressed the draw button and nothing happened. I thought it was something wrong with the game so I pressed a few more times, and suddenly he drew his gun. This got me killed many times. The game also forces you in situations where you have to make a choice before you can aim, which is super frustrating since you are pressing the draw button and nothing happends. It feels more like a clunky RPG games at time which does not work in an action scenario. Also buttons for doing sertains tasks changes making you many times pressing the wrong button or just have constantly check what the screens whant you to press. Rockstar: When I want to draw my weapon... just let me press one button and let the character do so, okay? Also another very annoying thing is that if you set your character to use the shotgun... later on when you draw, he draws his gun for some reason. Or again: not draw at all. Resulting in death or lot of damage.Also the controller input is slow and sluggish. you press a button and half a second or up to a second later the animation takes place. This also occurs in shooting. I am at a guy, and the second I press it takes half a second for the gun to shoot. By this time the enemy might have moved slightly so the shot misses. Irritating and frustrating. Also, with the lock on shooting / auto aim and always a hitmarker popping up showing if you hit or killed an enemy is immersion breaking as hell. Here you have this gorgeous looking game who sometimes looks almost photo realistic and you get this childish old shooting mechanics. It doesn't blend well. Also for some reason they added grey tracers coming out of the guns which looks quite stupid and ridiculous. This is clearly done to make the game easier to see excactly where you are getting shot from. But with their excellent sound system and visuals it would not hard to tell where the shots came from. The guns do have smoke, remember? Speaking of smoke, I wished they would add more volumetric and realistic smoke pouring out of the guns in the direction they were shooting. Like it was in real life. Instead we just have a big muzzle flash with a bit of smoke puffs that disappear way too quickly. If they had manage to implement this, the shooting scenes would look way better and more fun. I must also mention the game has no bullet drop / ballistic physics. So if an enemy has you in his sight and pull the trigger he will hit you no matter what even if you change direction 300 meters awyay form him. Quite annoying and it also makes firefights too easy but also too hard some time. If the game had more realistic shooting mechanics, it would be easier to go back to the game and just have fun shooting. As it is now, you get very quickly bored of the shooting.Thank god the euphoria engine is back though: Many thought it would be dumbed down like in GTA5, but it's back and better than every. You will never see a body fall the same thanks to the physics a.i. Blood and particle sputters as you shoot people. You can even blow off their heads and limbs if you have a powerful weapon. It looks quite amazing. The bodies sound and physics all have a proper weight and feel to them. Good job.The story is as you expect from any other Rockstar game. Especially from RDR1: Main quest has a more serious tone, while the sidequests and stranger events you just meet corky weird persons who doesn't feel believeable. Also Rockstar humour sometimes fails thinking that if a character is acting silly and have weird body emotions we should laugh. I didn't. I just got annoyed. That being said, there are some funny moments, but they are far in between. And many times you just know what is coming next, so it gets very predictable.The main story had three main characters I liked: Dutch, Micah and Arthur. Dutch is psychopath, Micah is pure evil and Arthur is just being himself, which is sarcastic a bit fed up and tired of this gang life. The rest of the characters in game is easy to forget since they are quite boring.I won't give any spoilers but I was disappointed with the ending. Dutch choices didn't make any sense due to the way he behaved during the entire game. Felt like logic was thrown out the window.I both love this game, and hate it at the same time. I wished that somebody else had made this game, except Rockstar. That understood better story telling and gameplay. Maybe Rockstar should have provided the graphics and physics engine and let someone else do the rest. I say this because I love Western games and movies. I feel this was a missed oppertunity to create something new and inique. Instead we just got a standard Rockstar game with updated graphics and physics. Leaving nothing new in therms of gameplay and storytelling.So should you get RDR2? Tough question. If you love Western movies, attention to details, just walking slowly, or take your horse on a nice walk up the mountains, hunt some animals, kill some bandits, rob a train or stagecoach. Yes, you should. I had more fun time in free roam than doing the boring missions. Sadly varied free roam options only unlocks when you do missions. Walking around in a town, interacting with people, seeing the incredible graphics, animations and sound design was more of a game to me than all the rest the game had to offer.;7/10;7 November 2018;28 out of 102 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;A graphical marvel, but...too slow.;Basically what the title says. The graphics and attention to detail is staggering! Huge bonus to be able to choose between 1st and 3rd person view too, AMAZING!! But the gameplay and general feel of the game is too slow, at least for me. There is ALOT of back and forth. The missions and activities seem extremely scripted and the game holds your hand quite alot. The gunplay is stupid, having to manually cock the hammer of the revolver is just dumb imo, prefer the gunplay in rdr1. The "random" events does not seem random at all, more like "triggered by proximity". The story itself is decent enough, I am only about 20 hours in, still at chapter 2, but when I got a certain mission in which I needed to steal horse carriages I simply did not feel like playing anymore. The main protagonist is an ass, same as the rest of the gang, don't really care for any of them. Fast travel is the same as rdr1 (which was trash) and it just makes the smallest missions seem like a chore because you need to ride 3km to shoot something and ride back to get a new mission, I suppose u could make camp and then fast travel,but why not simply do it like witcher 3 or AC Odyssey? A better fast travel system is what this game needs. Shame really, I want to like it, but too clunky controls, boring missions and slow horse has made me quit playing.;4/10;4 January 2019;20 out of 99 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;The Most Awaited Game of 2018;Without a doubt, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been the most awaited game of 2018. Originally, it was to have been released in September 2017, but had many delays. Were the delays worth the wait? Yes in deed. The graphics are stunning and the writing is great. On its first day of release, Red Dead Redemption 2 was already having record sales.Sometime in late November 2018, there is to be an online multiplayer mode, which as of the release of the game was still under development. If Grand Theft Auto V online (which is also a Rockstar game) is any indication of what we can expect, I believe it'll be great. If you are able to, buy the special edition of Red Dead Redemption 2, and you'll receive all of the add-ons and current DLC.Have fun playing!;10/10;27 October 2018;88 out of 113 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;Perhaps even better than its predecessor.;'Red Dead Redemption II (2018)' simply is a masterpiece. It might even be better than its predecessor. It's one of the absolute best looking games ever to be released. its huge, varied world is rendered in an impressive, almost photo-real way. It's filled to the brim with life, from birds circling in the sky overhead to fish swimming in the river beneath your feet to strangers stuck by the side of the road. The open-world is probably the most detailed and lived-in I've ever experienced. It feels markedly real. That's a good thing, too, considering the amount of time you'll spend traversing it. Riding to and from your main objectives will often take longer than the missions themselves. The lack of comprehensive fast travel means you'll be doing this long after you've seen every beautiful location the map has to offer. Thankfully, then, no two journeys are ever the same. The amount of ways you can interact with the people you meet out in the world is amazing, and the small encounters you directly control are incredibly satisfying to play. They're possibly the best aspects of the game. That's because the main missions, which can often feel restrictive when compared to the free-roaming stuff, are as often utterly thrilling as they are frustratingly slow. The piece has a deliberate pace which unfortunately means that it takes a while to truly get going. However, it very much adds to the overall experience. It's supposed to be long, ebbing and flowing as its seasons and circumstances change. Its extended epilogue does take the wind out of the sails of its ending, but it's arguably vital in achieving the effect the finale is meant to have. Regardless of its issues, the narrative is straight-up phenomenal. It tells an at once personal and sweeping tale, crafting characters that seem so human you could swear they were real. Something that the piece does a phenomenal job with is the development of its side-characters. The people who don't get much play in the cut-scenes can be spoken to around camp, or even taken on small adventures, which is somehow enough for you to form almost as close a connection with them as you do with any other. When one of your companions inevitably dies, it's genuinely heartbreaking. That can be said of the overall thing, too. It's heartbreaking. Yet, it's also exciting, funny, hopeful, tragic, beautiful and, even, poignant. It strikes the perfect balance between sincere and satirical. It's generally more serious than its predecessor and, as such, it's more impactful. Most of the silliness is reserved for its entertaining side-missions, which suits them well. It's often genuinely affecting and it has a strong underlying theme that lives up to its title. The writing is just wonderful. It's consistently good across each and every character you meet. The morality system actually changes some small things about the story, too. For the best result, you should get all of your dastardly doings out of the way to begin with. the most fitting ending, thematically, is the 'high honour' one. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and varied, with satisfying shooting and surprisingly deep mini-games. The animation, which is superb, does sometimes get in the way, causing some slight chunkiness that can be cumbersome to begin with. However, this is easy to adjust to and it simply adds to the overall slower pace of the game. It's a measured affair, never as unrelentingly fast as some of its peers but nearly always more satisfying. In the end, this is an engaging, entertaining and affecting experience. It's a massive, thematically rich ride that stands out as one of the best games of all time. 10/10;10/10;15 April 2020;30 out of 36 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;A game that changed the industry forever;Red Dead Redemption 2 is not like any other video game ever made including its predecessor. Red Dead Redemption 2 stands on its own and gives us one of the greatest video games of all time and is my own personal favorite video game. From the visuals to even the acting, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a league of its own in the video game genre. The story is a prequel to the first Red Dead Redemption game and follows Arthur Morgan in a gang of outlaws that includes a lot of characters from the first game, including John Marston who was the protagonist in the first game. After a job gone wrong in a town called Blackwater and they suffer unimaginable losses, the gang heads from town to town down a road for a better life, while robbing and conning their way to the american dream. Roger Clark who voices Arthur Morgan is absolutely fantastic portraying the title character in this game and gives us a character unlike its previous protagonist. Arthur Morgan is hands down my personal favorite video game character ever and I never expected to care so much about a fictional gaming character until I played this game. This is also hands down one of the most visually stunning games I've ever played as well, that has visuals unlike any gamer has ever seen before. Finally, this game has one hell of a story and takes us on a journey that we never imagined would end. With that being said, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a video game that stands on its own that will be remembered and played for years to come with the help of stunning visuals, a great story, amazing gameplay and fantastic acting.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;An instant classic;Greetings from Lithuania.So after spending more the 60 hours on a single player campaign and finishing the story and after reaching now level 35 in online, i can safely say "Red Dead Redemption II" (2018) is one of the kind. This is a pure classic. Where to start.Graphics are simply amazing. The story itself was epic and reminded of the best westerns i have ever seen. The storytelling was mesmerizing - i can't remember last time that i have played for a more compelling character then Artur Morgan. Sure the beginning of this game, like first 3-5 hours weren't that amazing, because this game takes its time to be played - literally. Like every single action that you do requires time. This is not a straightforward "GTA 5" in the west - its actually quite opposite. The pacing is slow in here, and some might not appreciate it, but after i got used to it, this game blew me away. I loved ever single thing in it.Overall, "Red Dead 2" is my personal game of the year. I loved "God of War", but "Red" transformed the open world genre into another level. The attention to details are mind blowing. Literally almost everything in this game is almost perfect. Its not a perfect game that is for sure, but its a pure classic - one of the best i have ever played and intend to play. Terrific experience to say the least.;10/10;6 January 2019;17 out of 20 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Red Dead Redemption 2;I get why people love it, but it contains hundreds of minor frustrations;I get why people love this game, it's brilliant, but a little too brilliant for its own good.For example, people laud this game's copious amounts of details detail, which can be cool in a lot of cases, like Rockstar's attention to detail in animal behavior, which is awesome to just observe at times, but other times the amount of visual detail and animation is more cumbersome and annoying than it is immersive, which absolutely isn't aided by the game's finicky controls. Since the game's controls are so imprecise, there will be hundreds of occasions where you'll click a button you didn't mean to click, or you won't be facing in the precise direction you need to be facing in order to do the action you wanted to do, so you'll be subjected to watching Arthur in an over-animated manner mount his horse, which lasts for literal seconds, before you can push the button that gets off his horse, an animation that also lasts for literal seconds, before you can do the thing you were trying to do before accidentally mounting your horse. Or, every single time you kill an animal, to collect its skin you have to sit through an unskippable animation of Arthur skinning whatever animal it is that also lasts for literal seconds. Or if you loot a body, you don't just automatically take whatever valuables a body has on it when you choose to loot, instead you have to watch another animation that lasts for literal seconds where Arthur bends over, rummages through their pockets, and then pulls something out through their vest pockets. All of these things are attention to detail in manners that actively make the game less fun to play. It would be all the more bearable if you were simply capable of pushing a button that would cancel whatever action you're doing in case you accidentally hit the wrong button or prompted Arthur to do something you didn't mean to do, but no, you are committed to sitting the gratuitously over-animated sequences through literally every mistake you ever make due to how finicky this game's controls are. Yes, the attention to detail in a lot of cases is very cool, but a lot of that detail just simply doesn't make the game fun.It's also annoying that you can't sprint through town areas without every NPC you pass acting like you're attempting to assault them, or if you accidentally forget to holster your weapon before entering a town area you'll have law enforcement raining bullets on you in a matter of seconds, so you're stuck walking very slowly for an eternity through buildings and town areas for fear you'll be wanted for "disturbing the peace" in case you accidentally nudge an NPC, which also makes the game significantly less fun to play. There was a time I had just wanted to sell a skin in one of the city areas, but I didn't feel like walking at a snail's pace all the way to the trapper, so I started I hit X to make myself move faster, and almost immediately I was wanted for "disturbing the peace," to which law enforcement showed up, which began a citywide firefight that left me fleeing for my life to the next town over so I could pay off my bounty and go back to the trapper to sell just one bloody skin. Moments like these are irritating and cumbersome, and it's extremely frequent moments like these that prevented me from falling in love with the game.The writing and characters and acting is very good, as expected, so it's worth checking out, it's just a shame that it isn't as much fun to actually play.;7/10;9 August 2019;6 out of 25 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Amazing game, just like we all expected;As most of you are aware, Max Payne 3 has hit the stores, and I gotta say, it's one hell of a game. let's start by telling you how the story was with out giving any hint of the ending or parts that matter. It's fantastic. The levels are long, the environments are beautiful, a bit lighter then previous games (MP/MP2), so a couple of fans might find this a disappointment, but it makes it unique. And the best part, that most game companies have forgotten, a dark, yet bad-ass story that makes this game worth it. And now to the multi-player. It really surprised me how good it was, at first, I thought it would fail, but it succeeds so well, that it might be one of the best, and when I say the best, I mean the best, multi-player that I have had in a while. the way you can customize your character and how they accomplished making bullet time working in multi-player, is just incredible, you can level up, unlock guns and make some EPIC moments using bullet time. The graphics, are great, good light affect, rain affect, the atmosphere is fantastic and the voice actors did an amazing job in this game, especially James Mccaffery (Mx Payne voice actor). This got to be one of the best games that you could get today, it has superb multi-player, a fantastic story and some of the greatest voice acting that you could get in a video game ever, this has been one hell of a ride that you shouldn't miss.

But I came here to just say that James McCaffreys voice and likeness as the protagonist can never be replaced by anyone. If anything, he's the only reason I even kept playing through the whole trilogy, It's a damn shame we lost someone who wasn't even that old yet. Rest in peace, and i still need to play Alan Wake 2 to see your last performance.

Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;This game kills all but one word to describe it... AMAZING;Max Payne 3 is another excellent sequel to the first two previous games, that impacted games hugely, but this third sequel has raised the bar. Rockstar have produced yet another quite simply astonishing game that cannot be faulted at all. The writer of the story show off a great skill at displaying Max's deep and depressed life that he drinks away to an inevitable hangover, and constantly pops pills to try and fill his sad and disheartened hole that won't go away. The story has a genuine catch and a very deep emotional side to Max's life which is very intriguing. Overall I think the game is one not to be faulted, and I can't express how much I love it. It is a one time great and a absolute must have!;10/10;28 May 2012;26 out of 36 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Max Payne: Rockstar shining again;First of all, if you are familiar with the Max Payne series, or even Rockstar games, the game is basically what most would imagine. It does shine in specific areas.Max Payne, the protagonist, is a serious bad-ass. The story immerses you in Max's horror-ridden past, and showing him at his worse. Max is an ex-cop with a dead family, a drinking problem, nothing to lose, a temper, and a gun. Sounds somewhat cliché, but his intense bad-ass-ery makes up for it.When Max gets roughed up, it looks so painful and gritty, you can almost feel it yourself. Every bullet, every punch to the face, leaves a painful obvious mark. And damn do you see every bullet hit. Aside from max taking 8 bullets in a day, his suit shows its wear and tear with him, a bullet to the leg will make max bleed until the end of the level. The bad guys have it just as bad, ill spare you, but it is quite gruesome to see someone shot up and down. They do deserve it though.The story makes this game so damn awesome, Max is a valiant hero by no means, but he does have a sense of good that he tries to make out... With guns. Max's emotions are intense, and when Max becomes angry or breaks down in tears, you forget that he isn't real and someone is acting. James McCaffrey is the voice of Max Payne. Perfectly, might I add... And Rockstar overlooks no detail in projecting a cinema quality video game. Even the sound track is perfectly picked for this game.-Gameplay-Max Payne is a third person shooter, mostly over the shoulder. Max has the ability to slow his perception of time, and get a couple well placed shots. This is what makes the game so unique. Max can leap in any direction while slowing time, and shooting like mad. Every gunfight seems like an epic movie scene *untill* you fudge up and smack your head on a wall.Most often, Max will engage a battle guns blazing, leaping through a window or down a roof, hoping to shoot as many bad-guys as possible before hitting the ground. This Rambo like approach to the game encourages you to take out as many enemies as possible as quickly as possible, sometimes before they even know whats going on. In some cases, I was able to leap sideways into a room while carrying a machine gun, and clear a room of a dozen bad-guys. Its quite fun to do, and watch happen, making Max that much more of a bad-ass.This game is quite difficult. While some might argue that the game is too hard, turning the difficulty down and turning on aim assist is always available. You can get through this game despite your skill.You control Max through the entire game.sometimes controls can be clunky, my only con was max's collision with the world. Hard to understand why he cannot literally step over a suitcase on the ground. But that happens rarely.Max has health, and it does not regenerate, with the exception of the last tiny bit of his life. He can pop a few pain pills and regain some health.Max can only carry three guns, two in holsters, and one two handed weapon. Ammo is plentiful, however you cannot carry quite as much as you might prefer, encouraging you to make your shots count during long shootouts.Again, this game is damn hard. When playing on harder difficulties, you MUST go guns blazing, make every shot count, and dodge thru the air to get the first shot in. Really encourages the player to be less *boring* so to say.That being said, I applaud Rockstar for another great game, an artful display, and keeping me on the edge of my seat!!;Not Informed;25 July 2012;12 out of 17 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;A masterpiece!;One of, if not the greatest games - let alone action games - of all-time.Max Payne 3 not only stands the test of time - it improves with age - I've just replayed through on PC at 4K 120hz AA x4 using an LG C2 42 inch. Whilst I remember it's Clear that Max 3 inspired John Wick & Co. Everything about the game is utterly magnificent. The soundtrack, sound design, ambient SFX, art, gun-play, story, direction, character arc, mechanics...it's a marvel of game-craft and, it is a better game than previous two, of which I also adore. It's rare a film or games action starts well and becomes superior the further towards the end you get. Those who have already completed know what I mean. The fizz you feel from walking into a nightclub to an airport - unparalleled in any game (think more fizz than the John Wick night club scene)!The noir, the gun-foo, the score, the OST, the story, the gritty truck-stop toilet that is Max's misfortune is undeniably back to and beyond, peak form with a several changes of appearance, location, alcohol branding and facial hair.Make no mistake, this isn't just a legendary Payne entry - it's an iconic game - an instant classic that undoubtedly inspired more than gaming.After replaying it for the 6th time since 2012 - it's now August 2023 - I remain entirely sold. I've a very powerful editing suit that has a RTX 4090. I maxed (pun intended) every setting, including AA on my rig. Wow! Just WOW! Every time I play the game is a revelation.I'm baffled by the lack of overall love from the community and why some feel it's not good due to a few aesthetic changes whilst ignoring that RockStar dialed everything way, way beyond the initial game and it's sequel.I love the noir New York City stage. It's legendary. That said, MP3 is as good, if not better than the rest if you remove nostalgia and factor in the many improvements and overall execution.Gawd, there's so much I could say. I'm absolutely jazzed. Totally pumped. I think I'll go replay it again!;10/10;15 August 2023;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Forgotten gem from 2012.;The gameplay is some of the best of its generation, but the gritty and pulpy story were what kept me playing this one over and over again. It plays out like an old crime novel you'd find in a moldy used bookstore and, man, am I here for it... Even the multiplayer in this game was a good time. Took a lot of skill and didn't hold your hand, which could also be argued for the campaign missions. Great game.;8/10;3 August 2021;5 out of 6 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Max Payne 3 - Game Review;When I heard about Max Payne 3, I naturally was interested, I loved the first 2 games and even though Remedy were not the ones working on 3, I still love Rockstar, they are able to tell great stories like in GTA San Andreas or Red Dead Redemption, so I was still very optimistic. Now, Max Payne 3 is not a bad game, not even close, but I can't deny it did felt like a step down compared to the previous games, the story is interesting at parts but after a while, you start to loose interest, while is a good story, is not as intriguing and engaging as the stories of the first two games and at times it gets pretty boring, the change of location was an interesting choice and they do take advantage of it, but it makes the game feel a bit distant from it's own franchise, thankfully there are some breve flashback scenes that take you to New Jersey and they feel more similar to the Max Payne games, now gameplay is something that has been improved considerably, the shooting mechanics are more polished than ever and the bullet time was perfected here, the graphics look gorgeous and the musical score by Health is great, in regard of technical aspects, Max Payne 3 is a near perfect game, but in regards of story and characters, this game is a bit of a let down, other than Pasos, there aren't many memorable new characters, none of the antagonists feel as unique as Nichole Horne or the Gognitti family or Lupino, none of the secondary characters are as memorable as Vladimir or Mona Sax, and that's a shame since this have always been a strong point in the franchise. Something I did liked about this game is the kind of story they were aiming, the first game was a neo-noir revenge story, the second game was a neo-noir romance story and this game is a neo-noir redemption story, that is actually a brilliant idea, making the Max Payne trilogy feel like one long story with 3 different acts, the execution though is the problem. Like I said, Max Payne 3 is by no means a bad game, in fact is pretty good, the graphics, gameplay and attention to detail are amazing, but the story and characters are unfortunately weaker and while the game is a fitting conclusion to Max's story, is not quite as strong as it should have been.;7/10;1 November 2017;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Good but not a masterpiece.;First of all i would like to state that this game was a huge disappointment, i never played the original games but i knew the reputation this series had so i thought it would be another excellent game. This turned out to be wrong.The story isn't too complex but it is interesting. Max is acting as a bodyguard for one of the wealthiest families in Sao Paulo until a group tries to bring down the family with the capture of one of the brothers wife. Max sets out to find her while also trying to figure out what's going on and why the group want's the family dead, things soon spiral out of control while he also tries to battle his own demons.I'll start with the positives. All the voice acting is greatly performed (James McCaffrey steals the show)and it feels realistic, the soundtrack is brilliant(probably one of the best around), the graphics are great(One of the best for a third person shooter) and the attention to detail is amazing like all Rockstar games, the style and direction of the game is very good and keeps it interesting along with the story.Although this is all ruined by the repetitive nature of the game it basically consists of: cut-seen kill people cut-seen kill people. It never or very rarely ever does anything to deviate away from this structure and after some time it can start to become boring. The linear level structure doesn't help much either you have to do what the game tells you to do, you cant take different routes or employ different methods to deal with situations, which is strange as most Rockstar games never do this. There are some other issues like: bad frame-rate, lack of exploration, terrible placing of checkpoints(or lack of them) but none of them add up to my overall major negative of this game...........................The difficulty.Personally i like games that challenge me, it makes it feel like I've accomplished something and it gives me a sense of reward but Max Payne is just ridiculously hard. I wouldn't have minded if it wasn't so blatant that they where just trying to pad the game. You'll be thrown into a room with very little health, little ammo, not much cover and at times nothing to recover health then when you manage to get pass this point the game doesn't checkpoint so you'll have to replay over and over again. I expect this from less known lower budget type games not Max Payne! The multiplayer is good, the dialogue is kinda okay(it's not fantastic like most critics say it's kinda cheesy and sounds like a b-movie)and the violence is awesome.It may seem like a don't like this game but that's not the case. It's good but that's it, not terrible not amazing just good, 7/10;7/10;25 May 2012;9 out of 27 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Pales in comparison with the Remedy games.;Max Payne 3 was kind of a let down to me for the simple fact of losing its identity. The game is awesome as an action piece, but a lot of the elements from the previous 2 games by Remedy that I fell in love with were lost, like the comic book passages, the gritty noir environments, Max's sense of humor, clever irony and poetic narration, the dream sequences and some other awesome things that made me fell in love with the two Remedy games. The only sequence of the third game that comes more close to emulate the feel of the previous ones was the flashback sequence, that's it, but it was only close. For the first game I give a 9/10, great game, for the second game, a straight and glorified 10/10, flawless in every sense, and even if times had changed, playing these two games today didn't reduce my devotion and admiration for them, but for the third game, sorry guys, it gets a 5.5/10, not that good, it lost many of the identity acquired in the first two, it seemed like a different game to me. Hope that they can bring back Max's world as I remember from the first 2 games in a fourth installment.;5/10;29 June 2014;11 out of 21 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Max Payne 3 is an authoritative must have for absolutely any fan even remotely interested in the genre.;The fact of the matter is that the only way to really appreciate and avoid some valid criticisms of Max Payne 3, one must see this game as more of a new envisioning of the franchise.What made the original game stand out aside from the bullet time gameplay was minute details. the fact that groups of enemies had hilarious conversations between each other, or the ingenious narrative with catchy phrases that practically defines the noir genre, and the entire dark shades and tones that overtook the graphics- Max Payne 3 does not so much do away with these things as update and modernize the series to meet the standards of today.For some players, immersion may be instantaneous from the hook, and for others, it may take longer, and there may be those who essentially give up because they find it mundane, however. the game is best seen like a playable movie that, by the second disc, truly shines: The narrative becomes more astute, the character of Max Payne becomes polished, and the story begins to pick up with quite some twists and turns.The gameplay is so refined that this game is the pinnacle of its genre and with the graphics and attention to detail being by far the best for action shooters thus far, Max Payne 3 truly shines as the must have and must play for anyone who wants an experience beyond anything out in the market.Another important note is the surprising amount of replay value and goodies, such as collectible "clues" and "golden guns" placed throughout levels that encourage exploration of detailed environments. This adds a definitive flair to what would otherwise be a straightforward shooter. The only real downsides are easily compensated, with the first being the minute skewering throughout some of the longer cut scenes, which is really just the game loading and also done deliberately for style, and also some of the numerous of cut scenes throughout levels – these can be skipped. However, the fact that there are absolutely no traditional load times throughout any of the levels again strongly contribute to making this game one of the best of its genre, and between this and the 360 degree gameplay, polished and refined bullet time, a duck, cover and blind-fire system that is effective and at times necessary, and a script with clever dialogue that eventually does pick up throughout the second disc, Max Payne 3 is an authoritative must have for absolutely any fan even remotely interested in the genre.Pros Gameplay, production values, graphics, sound, audio , script, replay valueCons Long cut scenes cannot be skippedScore 9.8/10;Not Informed;10 July 2012;11 out of 17 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;10 years later and still a masterpiece;Played this game around the time it came out in 2012 I was young at tIme and I liked renting games from my local game store and one day I rented Max Payne 3 and never got to finish it. Fast forward 2018 and I buy the game on steam and after that I fell in love with it the shooting mechanics were the best I've seen in any game the gunplay, the guns, the gore, I can go on forever about how good this game is. I've played every year since then. But none of that is why it's one of my favorite games of all time it's because the soundtrack. The main reason I fell in love with this game is because of the music in it. This game shines in every aspect but where it lifts off for me is with its soundtrack, I can say it has one of the best soundtracks in gaming. 'Health' is the group that created the soundtrack for the game and I can say rockstar hired there best cause the music in the game is done so well in every part of the game. I've played lots of video games throughout my life and this game beats all of them in terms of its score it might be might opinion but I believe it's the best soundtrack in gaming.;10/10;20 February 2023;3 out of 4 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;A good game, but not the best of the series.;Max Payne and Max Payne 2 were groundbreaking and innovative games that were released more than a decade or so ago. Everything about them was awesome, like the never seen before bullet time, the cool looking comic-page cutscenes, and the amazing story and gameplay. Skip to 2012 and Rockstar release Max Payne 3, this time more different in many ways to its predecessors. Firstly, while the previous games were set in the cold, dark, snowy nights of L.A., this game is set mostly in the blaring heat of Sao Paulo, Brazil and I didn't really appreciate it because it didn't feel like Max Payne anymore. Secondly, the comic-page cutscenes are gone as well to be replaced with motion scenes and I was a bit bothered as well by this because it was starting to feel less and less like the Max Payne we knew and loved. Another thing about the cutscenes in this game was that there were too much and control was taken away from the gamer a lot, yet the cutscenes were awesome and worth it. I could keep comparing the game to its predecessors but I think you get my point.Max Payne has a strong storyline supported by great animations and brilliant voice acting. No character feels or sounds cheesy thanks to the animations and the talent of the cast members. The animations, while although can't compare with Crysis 2 or God of War 3, are still pretty neat and clear. As you travel through the slums of Sao Paulo you begin to see the insane amount of detail put into buildings and the environment around you. The story is different this time around, Max is still haunted by the memories of his murdered wife and and child, but this time he is protecting some rich family. Obviously things don't go well and someone gets kidnapped and its up to Max to wreak hell and get her back. The ending was a bit predictable but overall, the story was very immersing. One of the main things we as an audience love about Max Payne is the amount of ass he kicks. The game has strong violence and strong language as well yet in a game like this you cannot have one without the other. As you face waves of enemies after enemies, you have no choice but to spray the walls and the floor with their blood. There a different guns to choose from yet all of them have the same objective: kill. The use of bullet time is really handy in this game and it is crucial for you to use it in order to survive certain parts of the game. Plus, the game looks hell cool in slo-mo.Overall, while this game might be different to its predecessors, it doesn't mean that it is bad. It is a great game yet no a game worthy of ten. I urge every gamer to play it. 8/10.'Over and out.' 2nd of October, 2012.;8/10;1 October 2012;7 out of 15 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Yes he is back!!!!!;After a long wait the gaming mascot of action games has returned. Picking up the franchise from game developers Remedy, A Rockstar studios collaboration puts out just what old fans have expected from a Max Payne game. Fresh and improvising upon the existing game this is indeed the king of third person action games. Splitting the review into 2 parts as I choose to review games based on the immersion and indeed game play.Story- A good effort put out by the Rockstar team. Exactly what you would expect from the typical Dan Houser style of writing video game scripts. Max is cynical and the story can take you to certain points where feel he is a little too depressed but then again this is Max Payne. Putting the player in his shoes psychologically is what Rockstar does and it does a good job at that. A good story line that is not bad at all.The game- Graphically great tagged with great game play that does not get old and fantastic sound shows the overflowing quality of this product in the single player campaign. The added cover system is only a small getaway from the frantic firefights. Its all about keeping the flow and maintaining a good and perfect improvisation for each situation. Just remember control of Max is smooth and once this clicks with the gamer the game begins to shine. A decently lengthy campaign that is well done and will keep you coming back for a few more spins on varying difficulties. The tech used to make the game is good so the enemies don't really do the same things on each play through. Apart from this the variety of levels is beautiful and something only you can expect Rockstar to pull off. Multi-player has not been a category i ventured into much but it is definite to keep you playing over and over again for a good time. Rockstar has done a great job here.Faults- The lack of dead-man walking. Seriously Rockstar should have considered this mode which throws unlimited enemies to the player. Minor glitches even in the single player version. The almost cut scenes which cant be skipped mostly can be an irritation for the player as you just want to get into the game ASAP at least on second and third play through. A small free roaming environment similar to the Rockstar's game the Warriors would have been a good idea too.Conclusion- a great game.good value for a game that is released these days. Meaty with single and multi player content that is overflowing with quality. A must buy for third person and action game fans.;9/10;19 May 2012;8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Holds up well even in Dec. 2022;Just started playing the game again on PS3. I'd only played a few chapters back in 2013 before putting it down and, for the life of me, I can't remember why I stopped playing it. For those folks who say Max Payne and Max Payne 2 are much better than Max Payne 3, ok, whatever. I'm not playing those games. I have them. I played through the first one a long time ago on my original XBox, and I thought it was really good, but I thought Max, himself, was a drunken loser who needed to pick himself up by the bootstraps and clean up his act. Can't change the past, so move forward. In other words, he was too flawed for me to care about. In Max Payne 3, it seems he finally has picked up the pieces.The graphics were exceptional for 2012, and they still hold up fairly well in late 2022. The Max voiceover is good. he's interesting and the story is engrossing enough to keep you entertained. The gameplay still holds up surprisingly well, and I liked the fact that I could change the aim/shoot buttons from L1/R1 to L2/R2. There are some long cinematic sequences, so sit back and enjoy the story. The music/sound effects are good. And the only negative I can say from what I've played in 2022 so far is that, like many PS3 games, the picture is dark and enemies blend into the shadows. I found the medium setting really challenging because of the darkness, and that's even after adjusting both the contrast in the game menu and the brightness on my tv. I'm playing the game on easy setting now, and it seems more manageable.Long story short, it's one of the better games for the PS3, so if you have the itch to fire up that old console or to jump back into your backlog of unplayed games, this game, Max Payne 3, is definitely playable, engrossing, and enjoyable in 2022, and I don't feel like I'm wasting my time playing it...even though I could be playing my PS5 right now.;8/10;27 December 2022;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;Great mechanics makes this a superb game;Greetings from Lithuania."Max Payne 3" (2012) (2012) was one of the best looking games in it's release year. Gameplay itself is outstanding - shooting, bullet time effects and gorgeous graphics as well as intriguing (but not highly involving) story makes this a must play experience + add a great (and surprisingly very deep) multiplayer.Max Payne itself is the star of the game. I loved the surrounding - everything looked superbly realistic, with tons of details. There are also tons achievements - good luck in completing them all. But this game at the times (many, many, many times) can be also very frustrating, because you will die a lot in it - A LOT - and i kinda liked that realistic (if you say it so when our main hero takes ~5-8 bullets and survives with some painkillers) approach. Dialogs and screenplay are excellent.Overall, "Max Payne 3" is different then two previous excellent games. Terrific game-play and presentation makes this a must play.;10/10;24 July 2016;3 out of 6 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;Max Payne 3;The years were not kind;With the passing of nearly a decade, the events and growth of The Fall are forgotten by the developers, with a retcon allowing for a retread: the death of his family tortures Max(McAffrey doing great with decent material), who disappears into a bottle. He is recruited by Raul(Dean, charming) for a job in Sao Paolo(which is authentic and detailed... you get to go around in it, visiting, among others, a nightclub, a mansion, and most engaging and threatening, the favela), bodyguarding rich socialite brats. When someone under his care is abducted, he tries to get them back(as unlikeable as they, and most characters in this, are).You can already see some of the problems. While a new setting is fine(and kudos for the choice to have most locals talk Portuguese, without translation - we feel his isolation, the foreign nature of his surroundings), and it is explained why he ends up there, it has no connection to him, he feels placed in someone else's story. It's no longer personal, and there's no new fleshing out of him as a person.In many ways, this feels like Kane & Lynch. With it being him instead of them, it doesn't make that much sense. And once one has drawn that comparison, here's where those work(I'll put those parts in parentheses at the end of sentences), and this fails: what you'll realize in this is that whether you've played this for minutes or hours, what's happening will be the same. Nothing is getting accomplished, so what's your motivation to keep playing(as opposed to small, and sickening victories - you're doing what you have to, and no progress is pleasant, it's merely getting you towards the peace and hopefully closure of the conclusion)? Cutscenes(with choppy, hand-held cinematography and color blurring, evoking the sense of being there, and being overpowered by what's going on around you - with the panels so replaced, what was a retelling is now an inescapable reality) take control from you(immediately breaking up your getting into it... and this happens within minutes of each other, there may be as much time just watching as playing. it will leave you in a bad position, with the worst weapon ready, no reloading and you not having time to do so yourself - and the foes typically already know where you are) and lead you to the next shooting gallery, rinse and repeat(rather than the more varied game-play, particularly in the '07 original where you assault somewhere, complete something vital, and then exfiltrate, trying and failing to do so without causing damage and hurting those you don't mean to).You simply can't choose the approach(it even chooses to spawn more opponents, early on it may even do so in your blind spot, preventing you from getting your bearings - and then expects you to gather ammo, as well as painkillers, that thankfully mean you have to work for health), for the first time in these, and exploration is all but gone. At least this does do many fun set-pieces where you're leaping through the air, on a vehicle or the like, where you aim and fire. The drunkenness might explain the sluggish, unresponsive controls that cause needless frustration - it'll rush ahead or stop in its tracks with no warning, and instead of preventing you from going that close, proximity to walls will make you point your gun up - again, suddenly, and taking time to get back out of that mess. I guess Assassin's Creed is not the only victim of such. Vaulting over something is what you have instead of jumping - and you can't always tell what you can "climb".Yes, areas are very small, and action is heavily scripted. Replayability(other than 5 difficulty settings) is present via the unlockables(some of them also for SP, and all of them benefit both modes), such as finding Golden versions of what's in your arsenal(with a more realistic approach, it's now limited to one two-handed, like a rifle or grenade/rocket launcher, and two one-handed ones, any of the latter can be dual-wielded, doesn't even have to be 2 of the same type - not even only pistols, also a sawn-off and Micro Uzis!) that will improve their stats, and Arcade. Yes, New York Minute returns, and it's joined by two other ways to redo SP: Score Attack where any kills and vehicle/similar destruction counts towards a possible medal, and Challenge, where you are given specific, tough tasks, such as "make all your 8 rounds headshots", "blow up guys by taking out the car they're standing by"(meanwhile, they're going straight for you!).The cover system is the most basic I've seen since before that trait caught on... the roll is present, yet can't be used to go from one of these bits to another, nor can you round corners. Disengaging from it leaves you a sitting duck, even if you're crouched! It also appears that those who worked on that(the whole minute they spent doing so) were not on speaking terms with those working on the dodge move. Neither can launch comfortably into the other(and certainly they don't complement the other... this offers nearly no innovation in this area). Bullet-time is glorious as always, and you can now slow down the Last Enemy Killed camera, as you, if you so choose, empty your clips into them. If you are nearly dead, you get a grace period, in slo-mo, to take out the one who wounded you.Multiplayer has TDM, Deathmatch and, when people play, Last Man Standing. Gang Wars has players fight with one of the up to 5 Crews they've joined, five objective-based rounds in a row, where the winner of one will determine who is in the better position for the next - fail an assassination? Escape!There is constant strong language, a lot of disturbing content, brutal, bloody gore and sexuality in this. I recommend this purely to big fans of Rockstar and current shooters. 7/10;7/10;17 June 2013;4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;You want to play in your own movie? You've got it!;Rockstar have been slowly draining away at my insanity for the release of this game, the teasers were enough to wet the appetite of myself and other players respectivly who were interested in this type of game.It wouldn't seem fair to compare this to GTA as other reviwers have ,purely because it has taken a completely different direction. Yes, you can still take cars, yes you can shoot and yes you can still drive around like a maniac but its all cleverly been done in the line of duty. They have taken an approach which has been unorthodox but who cares...it works! The story of Phelps (the player) is very neatly tied in to all the cases that the player must solve. All the previous cases come together and are referred back in later cases. The story has an incredibly thick plot and at times can leave you with a heavier brain once you put the controller down. It's very time consuming but well worth seeing it all the way to the end. Need i say the last case made me shed a tear....so it can be emotional for some.Gameplay wise, L.A. Noire is no where near fast pace by any means, but there is always something new going on, whether it be a police call for a shooting/robbery or even a real case to solve, there's nothing that ever lets the player feel bored or exhausted of the same thing. However this being said, the game has a slight use of repetitiveness in it, but is actually necessary for the development of the story. The controls are very natural and rockstar have really pulled out their finger to achieve something that no other game has achieved, realistic and emotional characters. The whole truth/doubt/lie system is just genius and gave me a warm sense of accomplishment when i actually got the correct answer. The facial animations using the facial motion capture are just breath taking, i sometimes forget i'm playing a game and instead watching a movie, it's that realistic! Graphically stunning, buildings look very real, cars are modelled perfectly and the characters need nothing more added. The whole environment is just brilliant with props to both environment artists and the level designers. Hats off the story board guys, to make a story that ties in so well with each other must make them incredibly imaginative.Overall L.A. Noire has really taken me by surprise, I really wasn't sure what i would expect to get until i played it through and my god you get hell of a lot for your money. If you don't come out with an IQ higher than 100 after completing this game, you went somewhere wrong. The game has been intelligently put together and has really left a mark on me. I'd recommend this to any player who likes an interactive, action, mystery and an adventure game packed all in one.Well done Rockstar!;10/10;23 May 2011;41 out of 44 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;A Truly Mature Game;I won't lie. I picked this game up due to the overwhelming hype surrounding it, and the track record of Rockstar. What I didn't expect was an experience as close to playing a movie as I've ever seen. A narrative full of characters that talked and acted like real people, and a hero that is flawed in realistic ways. Team Bondi put a lot of work in getting everything to look and feel as authentic as possible, and it shows. I've played through this twice now, nearly two years apart, and been completely and totally engrossed by the story and the amazing facial motion-capture technique that just adds an extra dimension to the characters you'll come across during it's very long running time.Some comments have been made about the extended cutscenes and what can be viewed as tedious and repetitive gameplay, but I had no problem with either of these aspects of the game, as the plot completely sucked me in. Make no mistake about it, this is a very mature tale that features brutal crime scenes, language, and violence, all of which are handled very matter-of-factly. There was never a point where I felt these things were over-the-top, however, but, rather, I felt these aspects added to the realism. Along with this, the whole city of Los Angeles in the 1940's has been lovingly recreated, from the buildings and locations, to the vehicles, fashions, and entertainment of that era.If I were to pick anything that I had issues with, it was the noticeable lack of side missions or random events. Given the attention to detail that went in to creating the city, I would have thought the development team could have found more creative things to do within it. There are crimes outside of the main narrative that you can respond to that gain you extra "intuition" points to be used during questioning or clue hunting, but not nearly as many or nearly as diverse as there should have been. Also, this is more than likely a game you won't be turning around and playing again immediately after finishing it. It's probably something that's best revisited maybe every year or two.Overall, I found this to be a stunning and eye-opening look at what games can look and feel like. If this is any indication of what we can expect in the future, I, for one, can't wait to see what's around the corner.;8/10;12 March 2013;25 out of 27 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Unique and superb;Greetings from Lithuania.The only reason i did not gave "L.A. Noire" (2011) a perfect 10/10 is the fact that i played it and finished it a 100% for the first time in 2020, nearly 10 years after its initial release - and games unlike movies do age. I played remastered version.Games like this do not come out anymore. "L.A. Noire" has more in common with a great movie "L.A. Confidential" then any other game i have ever played. It has superb story, amazing writing and compelling characters, with great acing by many actors. Music was great, and game does look great when playing it on PS4 pro 4K - its just that open world feels empty and repetitive. But those are minor complain. Other then that, this is a fantastic game, very unique one.;9/10;10 March 2020;11 out of 11 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Amazing;Rockstar games has done it again! This game is incredible - it's visually stunning, the gameplay is smooth and, most importantly, the story is fantastic. Once you start playing, you become enveloped into Cole Phelps. I bought the game at midnight because I wanted to watch the opening sequence, but I couldn't stop playing! Its true - the line between video games and movies is blurred more than ever. Especially with games like Heavy Rain and LA Noir (amoung countless others, such as Rockstar's own Red Dead Redemption), whose stories are rich and gripping. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about getting it. You won't be disappointed!;10/10;17 May 2011;36 out of 42 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Feels like you have stepped into Hollywood with a part in a 1940's detective movie.;One but cannot help but think that L.A. Noire has been inspired by L.A. Confidential (1997), Chinatown (1974), The Untouchables (1987), and James Ellroy's novel The Black Dahlia. After being in the development hell for seven years, L.A. Noire was released in 2011 and became a massive success. It is definitely worth playing, and if you have the patience to solve challenging puzzles you will enjoy this game. Also, you will learn how to read people during questioning and interrogations as to whether they are telling the truth, doubt them or lying by backing up your claims with evidence.Set in Los Angeles in 1947, the story centers on LAPD police officer Cole Phelps played by Aaron Stanton (Mad Men), a former US Marine Lieutenant who served in World War II in the pacific. Cole Phelps starts out as a patrol officer and throughout the game you see his career rise in the LAPD through various assignments with Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Cole Phelps is also assigned various partners throughout the game including Officer Ralph Dunn (Rodney Scott) in patrol, Detective Stefan Bekowsky (Sean McGowan) in Traffic, Detective Rusty Galloway (Michael McGrady, Southland) in Homicide, Detective Roy Earle (Adam John Harrington) in Vice, and Detective Herschel Biggs (Keith Szarabajka, The Dark Knight) in Arson. Cole Phelps manages to catch the eye of Captain James Donnelly (James Connelly) as a rising star in the LAPD and promises to keep a close eye on Phelps. Phelps also finds himself caught up with German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann (Australian model Erika Heynatz) and butts heads with former US Marine comrade Jack Kelso (Gil McKinney) who is working as claims investigator for California Fire and Life following the death of a former marine Phelps and Kelso served with during World War II.L.A. Noire is very addictive gaming at its best and you can't help but feel you are being thrust into the world of a post World War II Los Angeles. L.A. Noire reminded me a lot of L.A. Confidential.I wish there were more games like L.A. Noire however like this game it may take a number of years before a game similar to this will be released. Definitely one of the best games I have played in years.10/10.;10/10;23 March 2015;14 out of 15 found this helpful.

Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;A Successful Failure;I know that I will probably get a lot of comments about the tag line I used, but I sincerely believe that L.A. Noire had the potential to be an amazing game, but it fell short in several areas. It's a success because it -is- a great game, fun to play, good story... but it is a failure (to me) because it's the first Rockstar game I've scored less than 9. It fell well short of its potential.I'll get right to it.Graphics - 10/10 There's really no doubt that the game is absolutely gorgeous with the new facial scanning feature. This, coupled with the wonderful lighting and amazing detail to the city makes for a beautiful game to look at.Sound - 10/10 The voice actors are phenomenal. They deliver believable performances without going over the top and they add a perfect amount of emotion to the dialog. The music is also amazing, adding to the overall engrossing atmosphere.Controls - 8/10 There aren't any -major- complaints here. The shooting system leaves something to be desired, especially following in the wake of Red Dead Redemption. Driving controls aren't perfect either, but there have been much, much worse.Story - 9/10 L.A. Noire has a very interesting story behind it. I've heard it said before: GTA meets CSI. That's an accurate assessment. Be prepared for an interesting journey.Fun Factor - 7/10 Here's where things get interesting. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun, challenging at times, and interesting. My main problem with the game is after the first few cases, you'll notice that things get repetitive. You go to a crime scene. You look for clues. You go talk to suspects. You use your clues to get answers. That's about it. It also feels -way- too linear for me, often pushing you from one case to the next without giving you much time to explore the world and have fun.There's a reason for that: There isn't much to do other than the main cases. Sure, you can respond to random calls from dispatch, but even - they- get repetitive. Go to the scene. Shoot out/chase/hostage situation. Rinse and repeat.The major appeal to this genre for most people is the ability to go where you want, do what you want. While you might be able to go anywhere you want between cases, there isn't much to do when you get there. You can't even draw your weapon if you're not on a case. So all of those random rampages you love in GTA/RDR? Forget it. You won't be having those in L.A. Noire.Another part of the game that some may not enjoy is that it often feels as though you're watching more than you're playing. There are a lot of cut scenes. Most of the game is cut scenes.Replayability - 5/10 Since there isn't much to do beyond the main cases... No interesting side-quests, no random gunfights in the street, no stores or mini games or stunt challenges.... You'll already know all of the interrogation techniques, you'll already know who murdered who and why... You'll already have all of the answers. Where is the appeal to play again? Overall - 8/10 It's a great game and an interesting concept. I know it wasn't meant to be a GTA clone, that it was meant to focus on the detective work and case cracking that hadn't successfully been used in a game before. But since the game is so narrow in its options as far as cases/case order/extracurricular activities, it's really hard to justify giving it any more than an 8/10. You'll have a blast playing through the first time. But when the credits roll, you'll find yourself wondering if it's destined to collect dust on your shelf.;8/10;18 May 2011;64 out of 93 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Perfect detective game!;For someone that love detective/mystery movies and books this game was a perfect way for entertainment. L.A Noire was created for around seven years, unfortunately I can count the number of games in Noire climate on one hand, there is only one worth playing – of course it's L.A Noire. Therefore it's more like interactive movie with Grant Theft Auto mechanics and some people expect more challenge from games. I personally find all the puzzles and investigations too easy, I was expecting something more challenging. If you like detective movies and books you will love this game too. If you don't like them than you will most likely find this game boring. If you expect another Grant Theft Auto or Mafia I will have to disappoint you. Rockstar Games made this clear that L.A Noire will not include a lot of shooting. There are side missions. some of them include more fire exchange. Most of the time you will be looking for clues, driving to destined area and interviewing suspects and victims. There are at least 100 different vehicles including bonus vehicles. But what I really like about the game was interrogations and exploration of all the beautiful locations. For me L.A. Noire is located quite close to the narrative perfection, it's a precursor to the new wave of adventure games along with games like Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls or Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead. As result of games like this especially L.A Noire, new games like Murdered: Soul Suspect will be coming out soon. I have to give this game 10/10 because it was something that I was waiting for long time however I'm disappointed that there is lack of information about new Noire game. There is a leaked gameplay of another title from developers, it's called "Whore of the Orient" but it's taking place on the streets of Shanghai and I don't think it's something for me. I never enjoyed Chinese detective movies.;10/10;2 June 2014;5 out of 5 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Technically impressive but not as challenging, fun, clever or as engaging as it should have been and needed to be;LA Noire is the most recent game from Rockstar – a name synonymous with quality sandbox gaming, big open worlds where you follow a main story but have some element of freedom within a larger world. As a result I was excited by the idea of being a cop in the sunny yet seedy world of late 1940's Los Angeles, with its movie stars, its drugs, its secrets – basically it looked like we would all be playing in LA Confidential. To a certain extent the game pulls this off and technically this is where you are.I saw technically because it is in this realm where the game mostly excels. Spread over 3 disks, the game takes place in a massive city, with traffic and people going about their business while you do yours. It looks great from the cars, the outfits, the "look" of the characters in terms of makeup and hairstyles and of course the famous motion capture of the actors faces. This last part is astonishing as you do watch these computer characters and see natural movements and quirks – although viewers of Mad Men will be distracted by just how frequently members of that cast are used. The idea is good with this – use real faces to make the game about being able to spot a "tell" and call out liars to crack cases. It is a good idea. The problem is that it doesn't stand up. some faces are subtle but mostly the difference between truth and not-truth is pretty easy to see and then it comes down to having the evidence to say "lies" or just the hunch to say "doubt". I enjoyed this at first but quickly I tired of this aspect as it was never as cool or clever as it was billed.Doing the cases involves lots of cut-scene watching – and I mean lots since this where the game occurs. You drive between them, get a bit of action here and there but mostly you're not playing. I would be fine with this if the game-play had held me more but it didn't. Crime-scenes involve walking round pushing the "investigate" button till you have all the clues, then the interviews. The cases progress even if you make mistakes and only once did I really mess up a case and this was late in the game where I was starting not to really care. The plots didn't engage me too much either – there is an overall narrative here but it didn't work that well and some cases are solved far too easily. I recall one murder case where I was really engaged in the clues and complexity, went to a grocery store, found the murder weapon on a table in an unlocked room, chased the owner, caught him, case closed – it really hurt my interest and the thought I was putting it for it to just "end" like that.Outside of interviews there will be occasional car chases and shootouts, but again these are far too easy. Shootouts are generally all over in seconds without any effort, while the car chases will eventually end if you just keep up. Also, for some reason, in the chases, you do not get to shoot, only drive – it worked really well in GTA4 to do both, but in this I'm just the silent wheelman while my partner does the cool stuff – I hope that computer controlled character enjoyed it! So in terms of the story game-play I can understand the complaints because I did start to tire of the repetitive nature of it and I stopped caring so much and the cases started feeling like going through the motions. So what else is there? Well, this is a sandbox game so in theory you should be falling over with stuff like in Fallout 3 (where I could never go anywhere without getting another quest or random event) or Red Dead (where I played poker for hours and regularly found random little events while travelling). Well in LA Noire you have 40 street crimes but these are mostly very samey. I can think of several where I drove for 5-10 minutes to get to it, shot 2 guys and it was all over in 10 seconds. You can replay them but they are scripted and the same each time – they do not feel like random events in a real city. Outside of these? Well, you have collectibles but that's it. No random encounters and no real freedom to do much beyond drive round. The game needed random street robberies – people calling for help like in Red Dead, not cut-scenes, just people. It needed more freedom to pull your gun – you cannot pull your gun out in free-roam, not at all. You cannot hurt anyone and you cannot "mess around" when bored like you did in GTA4, RDR or other of their games – with this, when you're bored, going into free-roam will not help you. The very limited free-roam essentially wastes this massive city but also means the makers didn't seem to understand what the appeal of free-roam is – its freedom, not just the freedom to drive places for no reason.LA Noire is still an impressive game though, but it is repetitive and not as clever as it thinks. The cases are linear and the free-roam is so restrictive that, beyond getting collectables, it is fairly pointless. No random events, no consequences and lots of cut-scenes. The ideas are all good and the technology impresses, but this is a first try – not the game to buy and love. If a sequel ever comes I would be there as the core of the game is good, it is just the repetition, the restrictions, the focus on scripted events and the lack of decent action sections that hurt it.;Not Informed;17 August 2011;13 out of 20 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Very unique and engaging. Really cinematic.;I finished L.A. Noire tonight and I have to say that the game lived up to my enormous expectations for it. It was such a rich and fully realized vision, the tone was perfected and all of the detail added so much depth to everything. It's one of those rare games where the story completely sucked me in and the cut scenes became just as engaging to me as the shootouts and the car chases. I really dug that each desk had it's own tone to it. Homicide was definitely the highlight for me, it had a really dark and gritty Fincher-esque tone to it that I adored. Things got a little repetitive as the game went on, particularly in the form of the interrogations, but for a game that was three discs long they did a surprisingly great job of keeping it fresh and exciting all the way through. I loved how everything came together in the end. It got so exciting seeing all of the pieces with the flashbacks and the newspaper backstory start to fall into place as the story went on.The actors were all great too, probably the best acting I've seen in a game, it helped a lot in making it feel like I was playing through an actual film or television show. My one big complaint was having to play as Jack Kelso in the end. I understood how it worked within the context of the story, but I thought it was pretty ridiculous to have us play 95% of the game as Cole Phelps and then abruptly switch us over to Kelso for that last 5%. For something like this that is so cinematic and realized, I got very attached to Phelps and it drew me out of the experience a lot having to switch to a completely different person for that last stretch. Phelp's final scene was really heartbreaking.;7/10;5 September 2011;4 out of 5 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Can We Be Honest?;The game looks, sounds, and feels great. But as far as gameplay goes? I mean who wants to repeat an interrogation over and over and over in order to narrow down the perfect line of questioning? I basically memorized all of the cutscenes because you have to retry them so much. AND HALF OF THE TIME YOU CAN ENTER QUESTIONING WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE AND THE GAME DOESNT TELL YOU. Honestly its great but its not fun, at all, unless you happen to nail your judgement.;5/10;26 September 2021;6 out of 9 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;An Honest Review;OK, yeah, I was expecting GTA in the 40s.... but then again you are a cop and that kind of limits how you can act. It's not really a free for all where you can blow through cars at a red light and drive through foot traffic to get to where you are going faster.Remember, you're a cop, property damage kind of counts against you, but injuring pedestrians certainly does... at least in the story mode. Not so much in Patrol Mode.But then... the soundtrack is amazing, both the dramatic sequences and the era appropriate radio music. The lighting (especially in Black and White mode) is superb and really feels like an old Hard Boiled detective film...... but being a Chinatown fan, I kind of went for color.And it's fun driving around 1940s LA and solving crimes. That is really where the appeal is, but if you saw "Rockstar' and "Open World" I can see there you thought GTA in the 40s.The story slowly unravels as you put crimes together, your actions, the clues you find, and the how you question suspects and witnesses all determine how well you do, and how much you botch the case... which allows you to finish a mission and really screw the pooch, avoid tailing suspects by properly interrogating them, or put more links together and turn a small crime into a big bust.If you're not into the boring detective work and the unraveling mystery, it's going to be slow and tedious for you, but if that's the kind of thing you enjoy, it will prove to be a fun and moody game.;10/10;9 November 2020;8 out of 9 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Great ode to the noir films;What can I add that others didn't already. L.A Noire is IMO currently the best detective game ever created. This game can make you feel like true investigator, with occasional chase and "shoot rm up" sequences. It pays homage to the film noirs of 40s. Visually stunning, highely detailed and atmospheric in evoking post WWII Los Angeles. Characters expressions and motions are incredibly and voice actors have done their job superbly. Lots of older (exotic) cars contemporary to the time and some of them you'll need to find to unlock. Storyline is intriguing, emotional and well written. Cole Phelps is one of the best characters that exist in a video game. For this genre ans style, what can you ask for more? The only flaw is: it's very repetitive. But again, it doesn't spoil the overall experience.;9/10;31 August 2014;7 out of 8 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Best game I've played;When I went to read some of peoples comments, I was astonished that many people disliked this game. I thought that this was one of my most favorite/fun game I have played in a long long long time. The acting was great, with over five different actors from Mad Men. The scenery and story was very cool and fun. There were only a couple of parts that were boring, but that was it for me. This game comes with three discs of the same game. I have enjoyed every second of it. I finished the game in six days five months ago, and now I have decided to replay the game. If you miss a clue or screw up an instigation, your result could be different each time. This game takes place during the 40s, post world war II. We follow Cole Phelps, a world war II vet who is now a cop and is moving from rank to rank on the police force.SOme of the murders are harrowing, with naked women and some peoples faces are torn apart. But, you can have a selection to skip this if needed. This game might need some getting used to, but when you do, you just can not stop. I love it.;10/10;8 February 2012;13 out of 17 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;A masterpiece, but not without its flaws. GTA for adults.;Excellent cinematic atmosphere, story, soundtrack, and great characters. The interrogation gameplay was interesting, but sometimes also frustrating. At times the correct choices seemed a bit far-fetched or inconsistent, even if you were very careful. Maybe the developer pushed this gameplay mechanic a bit too hard in an attempt to keep the difficulty high enough. This prevented me from enjoying an excellent game as much as I should have. The combat also feels out of place (when gunning down hordes of nameless bad guys like in GTA) in a mature game. Flaws aside, this is still a milestone and an example of video games slowly growing up. The open world city is also amazingly authentic, arguably better (and certainly larger) than Liberty City in GTA 4. Porting from consoles was done acceptably well - you get HD textures and enough options, but there is a console checkpoint save system, 30-fps lock and a little mouse lag. Sadly Rockstar Social Club is mandatory.;8/10;16 September 2015;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Loved it: :);Graphics and acting were awesome :) your playing as a cop not a gangster or thief so if your expecting to shoot citizens you cannot as cops in real life cannot shoot at innocent citizens. i think rockstar wanted to create a realistic theme in a sense that way. i love the fact that you can free roam it tells you on the top left screen when you start the homicide case after you finish you click on streets of la so you can do the free roam look around and if your into trophies and getting everything you can do it here street crimes etc... so you can focus your main attention at your cases. I would play it again! In fact I am currently playing it for the 2nd time. I cant seem 2 get enough. I hope they come out with another one like this one. I'm hoping for one in Chicago that would b fun to see:) rockstar has another hit :)Facial scanning awesome need to do that 2 all the games :);10/10;30 May 2011;7 out of 9 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;My L.A. Noire experience (No spoilers);I remember watching the first teaser / trailer of L.A. Noire and was astounded by the richness and quality. I love the 1940s and after watching the Michael Mann film Public Enemies (2009), my hype for L.A. Noire went out of this world with L.A. Noire's trailer (2010) which came out exactly after a year or some months later. And when the game had been released, it didn't get it right away cause I was in university. However I did buy it for my brother. The Xbox 360 version that had 3 discs. Again after another couple of years later, I finally played the game in 2013. I took my time and played it slowly. Finished it finally during the 2nd week of January 2014. Man oh man, what an insane ride. What a game! I loved every minute of it, every QUIT & Continue (the retries) to get all them questions right during interrogations. Ha! It is a beautiful game with a brilliant cast and grand environments. If you love California and 1940s then here is a game that will rock your socks off from team bondi and rockstar games. Why the interrogations aren't boring? Cause the expressions given out by the characters in question are just unbelievably real. Even though expressions are common, the fact remains that each human being is an individual and it applies to our facial features too, that's what makes the expressions different. The game play itself is generous, without sticking to just one type and still manages to maintain a sense of consistency. Certain levels require certain types of game play ranging from puzzles to action sequences. And I have to talk about the crime scene investigations which is just beyond my appreciation. Some are bold, some easy but brilliant all together. The most important thing that keeps us going in the game is the story. Greatly crafted and put together really well. Finally, the music. You don't like the 1940s without loving the music from the era. Both the original score and the selection of classic tracks just wants me to say, "these cats got great taste mac." Thank you to every good soul that worked on this game, it is a beautiful game, a masterpiece. Hope I haven't missed anything out, even if I have I'll make it up with the following line: L.A. Noire is one of the best games ever made, I've ever played and you will ever play.Now that I've finally hooked my PS3 to TV with a hdmi cable, I wish I had played it on my PS3. But the Xbox 360 wasn't bad either.;10/10;17 January 2014;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Rockstar Games;L.A. Noire;Excellent addition and homage to film noir;I got 100% and all achievements in the remastered version of LA Noire. It took me nearly 50 hours.Likes: Crazy level of detail. The map is basically the entirety of LA in 1940, which is nuts, but my favorite part is the cases. Nearly every case is based on either a real-life crime case or the plot of an old noir film. The dialogue is really interesting. The voice acting, facial expressions, and mannerisms during interrogations are done really well. You feel like you're actually solving the crimes with the detective. The script was 2,200 pages, and it shows in the fantastic execution.Dislikes: In true noir fashion, nearly every character (including the main character) is unlikable overall.Dislikes that only achievement hunters would care about: You need 5 stars on every level, which means you either need to follow a guide (which feels lame and less immersive) or you need to play through once and then replay the whole game while following a guide. The collectibles are obnoxious in such a massive map, and impossible to complete without a guide.;7/10;29 August 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

EA (Electronic Arts);The Sims 4;I love the Sims, yet in the Sims 4 the Sims are too moody;I've been a Simmer my whole life and was super excited for the release of this game back when it was brand new. The Sims 4 is a great game, with beautiful graphics, great choices of outfits and is more realistic than any other Sims game. What I do miss in the Sims was how we had Karmic points like in the Sims 3 it made the game much more exciting and that we had cars, taxis. While there's so much you can do in the Sims 4 it also feels dull at times. The Sims moodlets change so fast. It's hard to keep the Sims happy all the time. Which would be completely unrealistic as the Sims 4 often times I have to remember sometimes during certain days we're just feeling neutral. Which is completely normal. The Sims 4 also has a new bug which is highly annoying and my Sims keep arguing with each other. I don't remember this happening in 2019, but now it's started and I've seen others complaining about this same problem. Hopefully EA can fix it. I play on a console, but I'm sure it's much better playing it on the PC whereas on the console it's a water down version of the Sims game. The Sims 4 on a console feels as though you are playing on a PC because of the controls and the mouse which is cool, but in the Sims 3 it was more easier to manage.;7/10;21 November 2022;2 out of 3 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);The Sims 4;Probably not worth the purchase;The Sims 4 is a disappointment to the franchise. It just doesn't have that many features for higher replay value. The relationships between the sims are cute, the music is acceptable, but it seems more simpler for children because you can only choose wishes the sims can come up with based on their moods and it seems to pander to these children by taking away a lot of things that made Sims great and even having you only choose wishes based on moods and not aspirations or personalities. Speaking of personality, you can't even choose more than like one trait for a child Sim for instance.Any Sims you create looks more like a foreign Sim than it did in Sims 3 and the animation/design seem exaggerated and it disgusts me.And I even heard the sims can poop an angry poop, die of laughter or embarrassment etc., I don't believe that can happen in real life. It just takes away a lot of the realism that made Sims great.I was so excited to play this game, but unfortunately, there's not much to do. You can go to sims houses, interact with people, but there is not a very big world to interact in.

EA (Electronic Arts);The Sims 4;Disappointment;The Sims series always wanted to become a big life simulator, just the only problem is that with this game we rather got further away from this goal. The developers decided to free us from the awesome open world, the possibility to track the life of the neighbors, and return to the starting point.But then what do we get from the Sims4? Pretty much the same thing we experienced in the Sims1 already.A multitude of uneventful boring days, where the most important thing you have to do is fulfill the needs of your household.Empty, aimlessly wandering characters around the world from point A to B, as well as meaningless random conversations between complete stranger npc's.But let's summarize the most important things in a little more detail: The AI: A bunch of unconscious, goofy npcs with zero personality. There is not even a trace of autonomy in the game. They can only take care of their most basic needs by themselves, but in the other aspects of the game our characters are completely up to us. Those existing personality types are totally unnecessary, since without the players the npcs are incapable to to develop any kind of relationship, friendship or even a meaningful interaction between eachother. Even if their sense of isolation is in the negative, they will not leave their home without us.Public places: When you visit a public place, you are commonly the first one there, and the other npcs just start pouring in after you arrived. But sending your household to these kind of places is usually pointless since the most npcs there just come and go, or stay about 2 minutes then they move on aimlessly to their next (pointless) destination... But beyond that the movement of the NPCs is completely aimless and random, the developers didn't even bother to have at least the family members or maybe the friends appear in a public place together.. House construction: The game practically has this one valuable function. Building your home is fun and easy here, and if you are talented enough, you can build practically any dream villa you desire.Attraction system: It's mood based. Which means that it is not the compatibility between the characters that decides, but their current emotional state. Quite a weird feature, and I'm not saying I like it, but I still don't consider it worse then the chemistry, since in that system even a ghoul monster could be attractive with the matching attributes. One thing is sure. Even if you create the perfect sim in the game, the NPCs will not find it attractive, therefore I think that the players should determine it in the game which sims are the most attractive and which are the least one.Overall, the game is a disappointment for me even with the dlcs. My suggestion.. skip this one, and let's hope that the Sims5 will be better.;5/10;19 March 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;A New Hope;I'm someone who was really burned out of Star Wars thanks to the many movies with questionable quality that came after the original trilogy, and thanks to the low-effort games that EA has released in the past couple of years.But this game is a breath of fresh air. It's exceptionally well made, it combines a lot of gameplay elements wonderfully from some of my favourite genres, it's truly a joy to play and it reignited my love and hope for Star Wars again. This is my New Hope.You can really tell that the many artists, developers and writers put their heart and soul into making this game. These people actually understand what was so special about the original movies and in general, about Star Wars. This game is a work of passion.The atmosphere is strong, the soundtrack is mesmerizing and evokes the same feelings as those old movies did with their own music. The characters are well written and likeable, the world is rich and full of mysteries and interesting places waiting to be explored.In terms of gameplay, the best way to describe Fallen Order would be that it's a lovechild between Uncharted and Sekiro, coupled with a Metroidvania-style level-design and progression. The exploration is rewarding, the combat is tactical, deep, fast-paced, and satisfying, and there's always a strong sense of progression.Buy this game, or rent it using Origin Access Premiere (like I did). It deserves it, we should support great games like this.;9/10;15 November 2019;73 out of 78 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Well Done;This is the kind of Star Wars game I've been waiting for. I'll give my complaints first and then I'll vent about how great this game is. My complaints: The combat in this game is choppy. One moment its smooth and beautiful. The next you get knocked down and pummeled by enemy attacks before you can get back up and defend yourself. Some of the puzzles in the game are unnecessary and waste too much time. It bogs the story down and takes away from the gravity of the game. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT: This game needs more story. After playing through the game, I realized I wasn't ready for it to end. The story seemed very short. The shell of the story is wonderful. But, there's very little character development and relationship building between you and your allies. There are NO side quests, other than simply hunting for more loot. There is so much potential for these characters, but we are given no opportunity to explore it.I really enjoyed this game. I am a huge fan of customization in games, and this game delivers on that wonderfully. The story is great with some fantastic plot twists that you'll never see coming.

EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Star Wars Metroidvania;The game borrows heavily from the mechanics of other great games, Uncharted, Dark Souls, and the metroidvania genre.

EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Good game, but with flaws;Greetings from Lithuania."Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order" (2019) is a good game in a spirit of Uncharted and rebooted Tomb Raider series. It borrow heavily from those two games, but so what - i like these kind of games and i really enjoyed "Fallen Order". Yet game was a bit buggy and glitchy and even crashed few times. Also i wasn't the big fan of a fact that these worlds did not feature fast travel after you complete their main objective - i loved design of them but going back from one end to another multiple times started to feel tedious pretty soon. But that did not stop me from exploring all 5 planets 100%.Overall, "Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order" is a very good game, but not great or amazing unfortunately. If they will make a sequel one day, i hope they expend on this very good foundation that they did here.;8/10;9 August 2020;14 out of 17 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Frustration is the quickest path to the dark side.;Jedi: Fallen Order had the potential to easily be one of the best Star Wars-related games to date. Instead, after switching between the Jedi Master and Jedi Knight difficulties and obtaining the platinum trophy, I must say that Respawn somewhat botched their attempt at a Soulslike-game. the game's combat mechanics are frustrating to say the least, meaning enemies whip at you without telegraphing their movements, which makes the game unfairly hard at times (I'm speaking as a Souls games veteran with platinums under my belt), and when you often get swarmed by multiple enemies, having fun with a good and enjoyably challenging SW game becomes but a distant dream of the past. Cal's movement is also really clunky, and that combined with the glitchiness of the environments (especially the sliding platformer sequences) frequently result in you falling to your death, even though you know what you have to do and you THOUGHT you did everything right.As for the lore side of things, J:FO is pretty good and actually feels like Star Wars. The side characters are not super memorable, and Greez is just the most cliched and unfunny 'funny' sidekick you can think of, but all in all, Jedi: Fallen Order is at times a worthwhile experience for any SW fan. Just be prepared to be constantly more or less frustrated by its subpar game design.;6/10;22 March 2023;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Almost a classic but expect frustration;Thanks to EA for bringing the world a Star Wars game that is more than just a bitty, online-only punch-up. As a fan of old titles like 'Knight of the Old Republic', a single-player, immersive adventure like this was just the ticket for me. That said, the game is not without its problems. If EA is planning more like this, I'd like to offer some constructive criticism.First - combat difficulty levels. I'm an old fart and my gamer reflexes are very mid-table by some standards. That said, I'm generally far above the easy-peasy modes, which is where I spend a lot of my Fallen Order time. It's just too difficult to time parries and use force powers - particularly against animals - without getting killed, a lot. I learned the game's ways eventually but I'm still mostly limited to 'Jedi Knight' level. Even on my second run-through, I can't nail a boss scene without taking it all the way down to kindergarten level. An unfortunate effect of all this is that a cagey, defensive combat style which avoids frequent death and tedious back-tracking also stops you generating and using the force powers which are really the key appeal of the game.Second - interminable cut-scenes that go on and on and on and can't be skipped. Please give the gamer the choice about whether they want to watch the cinematic links. They don't always enrich and can simply frustrate.Third - puzzles. As an Assassin's Creed aficionado, I quickly learned that the third-person mayhem of Fallen Order is only superficially similar to AC Odyssey, et al. Not only is the combat trickier and less intuitive, but there is far more head-scratching and problem-solving to be tackled simply to get from A to B. I learned to enjoy this aspect - apart from one or two scenes I simply couldn't crack without YouTube. I'd ask EA to make the cutesier problems a bit less obstuse. Examining one room for twenty minutes isn't my idea of a good time, nor is repeatedly failing an impossible jump because I'm new to the game and don't realise I'll be coming back to the location later with more powers.That's it. This game comes pretty close to classic, but the frustration needs to be dialled down.;8/10;17 July 2020;14 out of 18 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Unpolished and Lack-Luster;This game has received a lot of praise. The Characters and parts of the narrative are praiseworthy. The fighting mechanics are patchy, inconsistent, and frustrating. The duels between lightsaber wielders was my least favorite part of the game. The load times were unbareable. You'll wait for over a minute after you die. It feels like an additional 6 months or so of development good of pushed the quality up.;3/10;24 May 2020;8 out of 12 found this helpful.

EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;This is the TRUE JEDI EXPERIENCE;Respawn/EA honestly outdid thenselves... I also understand why Anakin was so impatient... I wanna just jump into action but can't. And that's because becoming a JEDI takes patience. My skills are no where's near perfection and honestly, I love that! Don't get me wrong, The Force Unleashed was amazing, but it was too fast paced, as if becoming a sith and a Jedi was simple and requires no patience at all. It was fun but this is way better. I love the fact that you feel like a padawan with no experience and over time and completion and earning skills makes you better, that's what being a Jedi is. I'd go in further but I don't wanna spoil some of the plot and I'm no where's near done myself. Simply put, this game is amazing and earned a 10 out of 10 for me. I'm glad I had to wait, it was worth it! If you haven't... BUY THIS GAME! YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED!!!;10/10;16 November 2019;10 out of 16 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;A great game, with some major and minor flaws;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a game we Star Wars fans have been wanting for years. We haven't had a Star Wars single-player game this good since... hell KOTOR 2. I wasn't overly sold on the game, from the idea of EA making another game, and judging but their horrific track record, who can blame me? The gameplay trailer we also saw didn't sell me either, as the gameplay looked bland. 'However', the game turned out to be much better than I expected, with a great story, great combat (sometimes) and great characters.There was not one bad charcater in this entire game, from our main lead, Cal, or Cere, and even the alien captain - Greez. The main villian of the game, The Second Sister was a much better developed villian than I expected her to be, and he made for a very intimidating foe in combat. The graphics and sound design in this game is flawless, while some of the textures on some character models look dated, the atmosphere is perfect. This game is like a blend of Uncharted, Dark Souls, Tomb Raider and Star Wars mixed into one, and it fits so well.I do have some problems with the game, ranging from minor issues, to major ones. First being, some bugs here and there. They aren't game breaking, but they can take you out of the game for a moment while they fix themselves. Also another minor issues, or I'll say major issue, is that there is no option to increase the camera sensitivity. This irritated the hell out of me. Why they didn't include this in the game is a mystery, and it makes for some combat encounters annoying, as you can't move the camera around fast enough to see your opponent coming. Which brings me onto the biggest issue with the game - the difficulty. Now I've played Dark Souls, and while that game was very hard, it was also fair. Here, Fallen Order works beautifully with Jedi Knight and Jedi Master difficulty. Jedi Grand Master, however is pathetic. It's like the developers were sitting in a room and went, "just make enemies hit harder, and make your character bug out while blocking, rolling, or do anything." When will companies learn, that giving enemies more health, and making them hit harder, does not make for a harder game. Smart AI, does. Fallout 4, despite it's flaws, has a perfect hard more. Because of the slow movement of your character, you don't have enough time to react to your enemies, making the mode both stupid and frustrating. So if you want to enjoy the game, with a little difficulty, avoid that mode, and stick to Jedi Master. As its pointless playing it on Grand Master, as you aren't even rewarded for your troubles with and achievement, making it even more stupid.So, despite the issues the game has, its still amazing, and should be picke dup by both Star Wars fans, and non Star Wars fans. Hopefully, due to the ending, we get some DLC, or maybe a sequel in the future, because I want to explore more of this galaxy in this way - maybe head to Coruscant, that would be sweet.9.3/10;9/10;29 November 2019;5 out of 7 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Good game but gets boring;It has fun mechanics, cool combat, great story and has alot of nods to the movies and other star wars media, but the majority of planets you spend a good chunk of the game playing on are really empty and boring and for me personally, its hard to stay hooked. I love the narrative but its not worth seeing the whole way through if you have to fight the urge to fall asleep while playing. This could be just me and that fact I'm not a hardcore star wars fan, I like all the movies (obviously excluding the sequel trilogy) but calling me a fan is a bit of a stretch.

EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;A good game? From EA?;I never thought I'd live to see it honestly. But for once, the company actually did something cool. A single player star wars videogame. And it's actually pretty good! The combat for the most part was pretty engaging and it was fun to try and parry moves to counter attack. The force abilities were cool too and were sometimes used to solve puzzles creativity. I especially enjoyed force pulling ropes at the last second so I could do an awesome swing, I really felt awesome doing cool stuff like that. Blocking blaster bolts is pretty fun too and taking out hordes of stormtroopers is probably the most satisfying thing in the world. However there are some faults. The game is extremely glitchy for one, sometimes Cal would fall off the map or enemies would glitch out. The respawn screens were also way to long I thought and it became a nightmare every time I died, which I did, a lot. And I also thought while being unique, the map designs were sometimes way too hard to navigate and you can end up accidentally going in circles which is frustrating, the overview map isn't too well done either, it's an eyesore to look at and it could've been done better imo. I would've also liked to see more planets, perhaps some that weren't in the main story. Speaking of story, it's not half bad, it's not completely original but for a star wars tale, I was thoroughly invested and I did like the relationship between Cal and BD. The main villain was also pretty likeable and she's one of my favourites and the suprise at the end was actually really well done and actually felt intimidating. The Order 66 section was one of the best parts too and I thought it was one of the game's stronger points. I liked designing my lightsaber too and I only wish there was a red option. Also Cal could've had more clothing options other than ponchos. This review probably sounds like a ramble but aside from its flaws, Jedi: Fallen Order is a pretty great and fun experience that is a step in the right direction for EA. I hope a sequel improves upon this game's flaws and comes out as a masterpiece. It's not perfect, but it's pretty fun.;8/10;15 April 2020;5 out of 7 found this helpful.

EA (Electronic Arts);Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order;Over Complicated, Clunky, Slow, Temperamental and Boring;Everything in this game is so unnecessarily complicated. Menial arbitrary tasks quickly become tedious because of the terrible run, jump and grab controls and mechanic. Over half the time you'll spend jumping at a head high ledge that he won't grab onto or swinging from random ropes attached to nothing to then moss your jump or for him yet again not grab anything. Extremely tedious puzzles and why is most of this game like Tomb Raider or Assassins Creed for the constant and repetitive climbing sequences. Movement is slow and clunky, the evade is useless even on normal/medium standard enemies prove too much because of the slow combat and increasingly annoying reliance on having to wait to parry. Big disappointment. Awful star wars game and awful game.

EA (Electronic Arts);Battlefield 5;Lost Identity;The game is low on content with very little maps, the game throws away historical accuracy even though it was marketed as a realistic ww2 game. The devs promised consistent updates with new content and almost a year has went by with barely any new content brought into the game. The single player is also a lazy attempt at pleasing the campaign audience. They ruined the chance to make a good ww2, in-depth story by breaking it into "war stories" which are mini campaigns taking place in different battles and different perspectives. The short amount of time each war story takes does not give enough room for character development and does not have any good action set pieces and is basically a gallery shooter of killing multiples enemies at once, than moving on. Would not recommend this game to anyone even if you are, like myself, a huge battlefield fan.;6/10;24 June 2019;20 out of 28 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);Battlefield 5;Buggyfield V - Incomplete edition;I'm a big fan of Battlefield franchise.

EA (Electronic Arts);Battlefield 5;A Tapestry of War Stories with Mixed Realism and Gameplay Experiences;Singleplayer Plot:My Country Calling:The prologue, following Battlefield 1's "Storm of Steel," comments on society's quick forgetfulness of the horrors of World War I. Serving as a tutorial, it introduces players to basic mechanics and sets the tone for war stories. Spanning various locations and characters, it starts with a British paratrooper in Narvik, a German tank commander in Tobruk, a Free French sniper at Kasserine Pass, a Bf 109 pilot in the Bombing of Hamburg, and a British machine gunner in the Final Defense at Nijmegen railway bridge.War Stories: Under No Flag:Set in 1942 during the North African campaign, the story follows William Sidney "Billy" Bridger, a convicted bank robber conscripted by the British army. He, along with George Mason, infiltrates North Africa to sabotage German airfields. Depicting the first SBS Operations in Libya and as part of the upcoming Operation Albumen.Nordlys:In 1943 during Operation Checkmate in Rjukan, Norway, the story revolves around Astrid, a Norwegian resistance soldier, and her daughter Solveig. A British commando unit, accompanied by Astrid, attempts to sabotage a German-occupied facility producing heavy water for nuclear research.Tirailleur:Set in 1944 after the Normandy landings, Senegalese Tirailleurs soldiers, including Deme Cisse and his older brother Idrissa, face discrimination from the French army. The story follows their struggle to gain recognition, culminating in a daring assault on a German position. Despite success, the Senegalese soldiers are forgotten, and Deme recounts the story in the present, expressing pride in their actions.The Last Tiger:In April 1945 during the encirclement of German Army Group B, veteran Tiger I commander Peter Müller and his crew defend the Ruhr against American forces. The narrative explores the crew's loyalty, disillusionment, and their ultimate fate.Negative Aspects:EA's venture into open-world gaming results in the opposing military in the game lacking situational awareness and communication. Actions like destroying a large enemy radar less than 1 km in direct view of an airfield do not trigger an alert at the airfield. This contributes to an overall more 'arcadey' tone, worsening the series' emphasis on the player and a small team winning the war, rather than a combined arms effort. This is somewhat countered by having multiple campaigns, as in BF1, but with the exception of "Tirraileur," you almost have no friendlies.The anachronistic use of gear and optics is evident. The first reflex sight for a portable weapon, the Nydar, was patented and released in late September 1945, after the war had already ended. It was designed for hunting shotguns, was relatively expensive, somewhat fragile, and never gained widespread popularity.Enemies in Battlefield 5 drop Universal Ammo, so you never worry about weapon/ammo compatibility.Medics can revive enemies, even with HE shots to the head.Positive Aspects:Graphics.Joke at the end of the first campaign.All characters speak in their native language, with subtitles provided for the non-English speaking campaigns.War Story "Tiralleur" tackles a point almost no one dares to speak of.War Story about the German perspective.;7/10;14 November 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

EA (Electronic Arts);Battlefield 5;Another Battlefield;Battlefield is a series that I got into when playing the 4th installment and I have always liked the gameplay presented. However, here, Battlefield remains kind of the same in comparison to Battlefield 1 with not many innovations. This is not necessarily a bad thing because the multiplayer remains easy to hop in and to have fun for some matches. Where I found Battlefield V to be lacking is in the campaign. The stories told are pretty interesting because they tell stories of the Second World War that are not often highlighted in media and I was genuinely interested in them. Where it falls flat here is the gameplay design (and especially on higher difficulties). The levels first start out with some stealth which does not work well on higher difficulties since you basically cannot sneak past them without them noticing you even if you just try to look around a corner to see if there are enemies at all. And at the end you get this big map where you basically do the same but now you need to travel between long distances. The last two war stories did try to mix it up a bit but this was still lackluster since it then became your standard first person shooter affaire. Overall, I think that Battlefield V is not a bad game, but that it definitely needs some changes in its campaign (especially the design) to convey these stories better. I hope that the next Battlefield I play is going to innovate more and that it does not solely rely on its multiplayer because in my opinion this only stays fun for some casual games.;6/10;8 February 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The medic uses submachine guns, the Support uses light-machine guns and machine guns.

EA (Electronic Arts);FIFA 21;Scripting;Why can't they make fifa as plain as simple as fifa 13 - fifa 19? since then they had to add scripting. people think it's so you buy fifa points and packs- but i can't even play a career mode game as manchester city without getting scripted against swansea city. it's stupid in any game mode, you get a lead on then players make sloppy passes going in places you never intended, first touches are slow and heavy and tackles are soft and poor.;1/10;8 February 2021;11 out of 11 found this helpful.
EA (Electronic Arts);FIFA 21;Worst fifa game ever;This game is totally garbage. Controlling is very bad, it's like player never run for the ball. And defending is totally awful. Never tackle any one.

EA (Electronic Arts);FIFA 21;Best fifa we have had in years;Ok so I will start of by saying the people giving this terrible reviews are salty and have some vendetta against EA..Now for the actual review.. fifa has been terrible ever since fifa 16 it's been the same repetitive gameplay for 4 years... This year hits completely different the gameplay feels smooth doing things is actually very rewarding I have gained 500k without spending money and I am a div 5 player...This is the best fifa we have had for 5 years without a doubt.;10/10;28 October 2020;8 out of 39 found this helpful.

EA (Electronic Arts);FIFA 21;Defenders look Stoned;Yep, the worst Fifa game ever released.Defenders - not much point having them, can't keep up with simple turns in the box. On some sort of drugs. Goal.Through Balls - Loved watching an 80 yard throughball from Rob Holding slice open all 10 of my outfield players. Goal.Penalties - The lightest touch from either a player or Oxygen and its an instant penalty. One got given against me when my PlayStation controller wasn't even being touched. Goal.Keepers - Just fire it in near post. Goal.The Classic Fifa Goal - Through ball down the wing and cut back. Guarantee you'll always have around 2/3 attackers with no defenders anywhere near as per ACTUAL FOOTBALL GAMES. Goal.Switching players - The player you've just switched from seems to think his shift is over and its down to the pub. Why tackle when you can beer? Goal.Kick off - Just run past the whole opposition team. Goal.Skill moves - It's like University Challenge to a defender, just start doing kick ups from your own half, they can't work it out. Goal.Most games after 10 mins of play - 12 all.Most FUT teams - Anyone with pace. So glad we see such variation in teams. Of course means pace means nothing in the game and can be countered. Not.Referees - Similar tackles are pot luck with what card you get, just fly in. Not like your defence will tackle anywayOnline - had this for months and still not had a 0-0 which everyone would crave at this point instead of NBA style point scoring.Deleted.;1/10;12 February 2021;12 out of 14 found this helpful.

EA (Electronic Arts);FIFA 21;Shame Shame Shame;If you are responsible for the gameplay of this fifa you should feel deeply ashamed. The inconsistency, the illogic choices, its bad really bad. In order to combat the funny collisions on YouTube they decided to build in AI movements and invisible walls so it looks smoother but plays like garbage. Your player holds back speed by itself so it wont cover a pass. Your player walks against an invisible wall when the ball is in the air. Very often you feel the player slide in a train track or something, a path it wants to stick in. Fifa is getting worse over the years but this one is the deal breaker for me, after +/- 25 years of playing this is the last one. They make it more addictive with FUT special cards but the gameplay is the worst ever. I cancelled my ps5 order and retire gaming.;1/10;13 June 2021;5 out of 5 found this helpful.

I bought the digital version for 35 euros (half of the price ) with a friend ( because i'm not stupid to spend 70 euros in this "game") and at the beggining the gameplay felt fresh and clean. However, after 2 weeks, EA patched it and ruined it completely. After 3 weeks guess what, another patch to change the gameplay and obligate us to adappt once again. Ultimate team could be a funny mode to play but EA destroys it. Carreer mode and pro clubs are the exactly same thing, a little change in the menus and that but nothing extraordinary. And Volta...

EA (Electronic Arts);FIFA 21;In Game-Purchase Scam. PLEASE AVOID.;I haven't played a football video game in a minute. So I bought FIFA 21. From the get go, I felt compelled to use real money to buy fake money to basically buy cards that yield the same players over and over. That was my mistake.This is gambling. EA should be ashamed that they are peddling it to children. Why not tell kids to smoke crack while they're at it?I haven't even gotten to the game itself: Broken, unrealistic, glitchy, scripted and the FUT community is just horrible. Horrible.It was a bad decision to buy this game, that wasn't heap by the way. I wish I could sue EA for mental distress. That being said, I'm going to go outside and play real football with my 3-year-old. At least that's free, fun and he won't magically score on me at the last second of extra time. Shame on you EA.;1/10;8 June 2021;3 out of 3 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;What an odyssey, in every way possible;I saw the debut trailer for Versus XIII back in 2006 and the quality of this game was thus in question to the last minute. The director change to Tabata undeniably saved this troubled production but it's very clear that he still needed another year to complete his ambitious vision. The game is divided in 2 parts. The first half is a fun road trip that put exploration first. The ultimately large game world is a bit more fractured into closed off "arenas" than i would have liked. You will need to rely on Chocobos or teleportation to get around, as your car can only go on roads and mostly drives itself. The slightly weird battle system frankly feels like a step backwards, as even the problematic XIII trilogy had a better ones. They should have gone with a true hack and slash battle style, instead of this "tactical" Kingdom Hearts approach, yet it works fine enough. The graphics, soundtrack and voice acting are great. As long as you use the superior Japanese VAs and i noticed that the translation takes many liberties, as the subtitles are based on the English script. Characterization is where the game shines, so on to the "boyband". All 4 are some of the best characters SE ever brought to life. The story is fairly engaging too, as long as you kept up with the media-tie ins, as neither the world nor the boy's backstories are properly explained. This half of the game barely features villains and i just kept going on hunts, went fishing or hunted the royal arms. Luna, her guardian and Aranea (i cheated her into my party) are further great female characters but the mechanic Cindy turned out to be the sexist otaku bait all expected in the end. None of them are seen all that often though. I ended up spending 60 hours till my quest log was all out of missions and on i traveled to the Venice equivalent of the game. The second half took me about 10 hours to complete but i will admit that i could 1-hit-kill half my enemies at this point due to being overpowered. Most of the game's surprisingly dark story is told here and what a skeleton it turned out to be! Characters randomly show up and disappear without warning. The open world returns to the "running down corridors" design of XIII and i had to look up a fan explanations to understand what even happened. And most imploringly why it happened. Meaning that SE published a 2nd Xenogears, with the difference that this borderline broken 2nd half was still fun. My investment in the characters ultimately made me focus on the good sides, even if i rarely played less complete games. The much dreaded Chapter 13 was actually a slightly flawed highlight (your 1 weapon is a bit too weak), as enough of it is finished to understand what happens and the survival horror atmosphere was a welcomes change of pace. The game's finale is thankfully a masterpiece, so the team at least focused on landing the ending. I then returned to the open world and spend a final 20 hours on doing endgame quests and getting my Platinum. I will never deny that the game shouldn't have been shipped in this from but the devs are focused on delivering the necessary patches and content to fill in some of the blank canvas. I lastly finished all offline FF games + most spin-offs. FF XV could have been a top 5 entry if the game was done but the finished product is still a modern RPG highlight and ultimately a success, after 10 years in development hell. 8,5/10;8/10;13 April 2017;17 out of 19 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;My favorite Final Fantasy since the tenth one;I have played nearly every installment of the Final Fantasy series. It was one of my favorite series of role playing games, that is until they decided to go online and then release games that just did not seem all that much like a Final Fantasy game. The last one I really enjoyed a lot was the tenth edition, I even liked its sequel. however, I never did play the eleventh game due to it being exclusively an online game. Then the twelfth game came out and I was rather disappointed as it still ranks as my least favorite. Granted, I am wanting to play it again to see if I may have misjudged it and ranked it poorly unfairly. Then came part thirteen and it was pretty, fast paced and devoid of a lot of things that make a role playing game, a role playing game. I also played through XIII-2 and it had more elements of a role playing game, but the story was just so congested in it. Then there was XIII: Lightening Returns which collapsed more story on top of what was already congested and made the game a timed game and I was unable to complete it due to this as it annoyed me. Did not play the fourteenth game due to it being another online one, I really wish these were not part of the main series and just called Final Fantasy Online. The last one I played is Final Fantasy-Type 0 which had great characters and fun combat, but the story was just a bit too hard to follow. Now there is this one which is by far my favorite since the tenth game. Sure, it is not turn based like the old days which I prefer, but at least the combat is action based and not that strange combination which is not really turn, but not really action either. The type usually found in online role playing games, the twelfth game was like this. No, in this one the combat is quick and you have a nice open world to explore for the most part. My main complaint about it, is that like Type-0 the story is not easy to follow. It is easier than Type-0 as it has a well defined villain, but a lot of stuff takes place off screen or you have to watch a movie or download a DLC to get everything. I just feel a game's story should be confined to the main game and you should not be required to purchase more stuff to get the full picture. Other than this it is a very fun, albeit depressing game.The story is a bit complicated when looked at as a whole. however, the main portion is about a prince and his three friends traveling the world in order for the prince to reclaim his thrown by gaining the powers of the former kings and the summons. The characters are what makes this one so fun as they are just a group of friends and they have funny conversations and remarks during the adventure. Your group travels everywhere in search of the power to expel the empire from the city of Insomnia. however, there is something far more sinister than a mere invasion as the days are getting shorter and during the night powerful creatures known as daemons appear to terrorize the populace. Soon Prince Noctis heads to a city where he was to be married and at this point the game does get rather depressing.The game play features combat that is action based. During the game you only control Prince Noctis, but despite this it is still rather fun. The summons in this game are awesome as they usually wipe everything out! The first portion of the game is an open world where you travel here and there in search of the King's tombs and do other things such as side quests to gain experience. This one also does things a bit differently as you do not get experience upon defeating the enemies, but rather when you either camp or stay at a hotel or rest stop. You generally get more experience for staying at a hotel or rest stop. however, you can eat a meal when camping that provides buffs to your party. The game becomes a bit more straight forward though when you go to the city of Altissa which looks like Venice. After this the game's mood darkens significantly, but there is a rather cool portion of the game that features a train. Always enjoy trains in role playing games.So, this game was my personal favorite Final Fantasy since the tenth game. I would have ranked it higher, but the story was a bit hard to follow at times due to the incessant need these days of games to have DLC packs and such. I also wish the tone of the game did not darken so much after the group left for Altissa as my life is at the lowest point imaginable and it really just caused me to feel worse. I was also disappointed that you are pretty much done with the open world once you leave for Altissa as I was thinking you would get more time to finish quests and such. I think you can go back in time or something and do it, but I just did not think that fit so I just went straight ahead. The game took me just over 60 hours to complete making it a relatively short game by today's standards and I completed a lot of side quests too so if you play straight through I imagine you could probably finish the game between 40 and 50 hours. So not as great as the Final Fantasy games back in the day, but better than all the recent ones.;9/10;19 March 2017;17 out of 20 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;Brilliant game, cheated potential;This game has such a rich, complex story, and fair character development to boot. Unfortunately, not all of it is in the base game.It's why so many feel the game is incomplete.As a fan, I love extra content that adds to an already amazing experience. FFXV is not an example of that.A few issues I had with the game: 1.) Sidequests need a reason to exist, even if it's shaky. Like the chocobo ranch or armiger quests. Otherwise, why would the protagonist postpone saving the world?2.) Instead of a "slideshow", events of "Kingsglaive" should have been a side quest/story chapter.3.) Cast needs more in-game development. Anime is great, novels too--but game should reference that.It's a solid game, but you really have to invest some time in and out of it.The game starts in the middle of the entire FFXV narrative. So at a bare minimum, I recommend watching the anime OVAs and Kingsglaive movie before playing the game.;7/10;10 December 2019;2 out of 3 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;Has Heart, But Also Big Flaws;This is a tough one. I've loved the FF series through its highs and lows and I've actually come to really appreciate this entry over time. I first got it when released in 2016 and it was clear that it was unfinished. The plot was choppy and confusing, some of the mechanics were sloppy, and the level of polish really varied throughout the game. However, the relationship between Noct and the boys has always been compelling.Many of these issues have been addressed over time with DLCs, the spin-off anime, and the CGI film. I've seen them all because I always felt there was some interesting source material here worth exploring and watching them really does elucidate a lot. The problem is, people shouldn't be asked to do that. FF7, for example, still had a confusing narrative, but the plot was intact and all the spin-offs served to enrich the story, not complete it.In terms of the technical issues, the development was clearly an ironically epic journey. This game was ambitious, and I'm surprised how good it looked at times in 2016. Patches and 60 fps updates makes it run much more beautifully now but the variability in polish during different game areas and occasional sloppy combat is still present. However all this being said, they aimed for the stars and I'm sure took notes on what worked and what didn't.In the end, this is a unique entry with heart but it just wasn't fully fleshed out. There's a rich lore that unfortunately demands an unreasonable amount of time and money for fans to be able to fully appreciate it. However, Square Enix has shown consistent evidence of listening to their fans (example, making this an open world entry after the feedback that FFXIII was too linear). I have hope that this will lay the groundwork for future entries to be technically better but hopefully also more cohesive from a plot standpoint.;8/10;18 June 2022;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;I'm not really satisfied about the Final Fantasy XV;I am a fan of Final Fantasy for over 15 years. This is the game I'm looking forward to playing, but when I finish the game and do a lot of side quests, I feel Final Fantasy 15 not as good as the previous Final Fantasy releases.Worldmap is very large, but only one city (Altissia), a town (Lestallum) a city of main story (Insomnia), the rest are mostly gas stations, this is not good with a version of the Final Fantasy game. In the Final Fantasy versions 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 and many other versions, the number of cities is numerous and wide, accompanied by a wide variety of side quests. Maps of Final Fantasy 15 are mostly desert, rocky, prairie and not exciting. The side missions are also very monotonous, repetitive. The Ability System is very similar to Final Fantasy 10. The way to absorb element ( Fire, Ice, Lighting ) is borrowed from Final Fantasy 8, and a lot of things of the Final Fantasy 15 reminds me to old Final Fantasy releases.The summon method is not good and very random. Summons seem useless in this game, they only have a role to contribute to the content of the game.The game content is really short and less interesting. The plot is predictable. I was excited when buy this game to play, but when I was playing with 200 hours of play, I felt unhappy, and I evaluated the game with a score of 7/10.Sorry for my bad English .;7/10;10 April 2017;4 out of 9 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;Great Game, but History Incomplete;A great game, but unfortunately the stories have numerous faults and unanswered questions, in the second part of the game, which seems to have been done in a hurried way, without delivering what it has promised in its previous traillers. Many characters are simply downgraded and barely appear in the game, and a lot of fact is not explained, I think this is perhaps because the focus is the gameplay and not the incredible story that was developed for this game, something that makes gamers Old school may hate it by having the most faulty history of all the end fantasys made to this day. I believe the creators were forced to deliver incomplete content, even including the Kingsglaive movie and the anime episodes. I just believe that just a new movie or a great update (I mean really big!) Can fill the story with the expectation created not only for the years, but for the traillers that create a great expectation for all fans.;5/10;31 December 2016;4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;An Enjoyable but Flawed Entry in the FF Series;FFXV gets a lot of things right. The world is stunning, the music (as usual) is exquisite, and the character and monster designs are awesome. Sadly, the game is bogged down by an excessive amount of empty space and wasted potential.Open world RPGs are a difficult thing to perfect. Games like Skyrim are able to incorporate a massive map because of the sheer content and substance within. While FFXV definitely has the geographic size to compete, much of the gameplay is spent simply traversing from point A to point B in silence. While enemy encounters are relatively common, they don't do quite enough to liven up some of the game's downtime. Longer distance journeys in the game are made via driving a car, which can take several minutes and get long-winded very quickly.The combat system is entertaining, but it can become a bit monotonous as character attacks are made by simply holding down a button. It's helped by item usage and special moves with team members, but it still feels a bit like the game is playing itself.Despite these drawbacks, FFXV shines in its worldbuilding and story. The voice acting is top-notch, and in Final Fantasy fashion, the player is taken on a thrilling and emotional adventure. Dungeon exploration is great, and the boss battles are wondrous spectacles to behold.Ultimately, Final Fantasy XV is a mixed bag. It will definitely please die-hard fans of the genre and series, but newcomers and casual fans may have difficulty with the monotonous world travel and sparseness of some of its environments. Either way, it's worth a try.;8/10;4 April 2021;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Final Fantasy XV;NISSIN CUP NOODLE SOUP™;Christmas 2016 was promicing and I got Final Fantasy 15 from my loving sister. However when I popped it it in their was something novel. That eventually wore off. Hahahah!STORYFinal Fantasy 15 is starts with a medius rez where we play as 4 boys fighting with daddy. It then fades into the 4 boys have a duty. They must protect the kingdom from the evil Kingdom. It starts with the boys pushing a Regalia. Then they go off into the world. They do boring quests.What I hate about this video game is it's story. It's lack their of ambition. It's a fantasy set in a modern day world yet is still fantasy. IT'S STILL A FICTIONAL WORLD THAT DOESN'T EXIST! It couldn't be any different than FF8 but duller. It could be set in New York like Parasite Eve and could be a billion times more creative. This world is like America but with medieval castles and spells.The characters are fairly boring douchey **** boys from Entourage. They wall wear bland leather clothing. Even if they wear different clothing which does not make a difference they are still boring nobs. The girl is boring.Everything is so un-epic that I lost complete interest.GAMEPLAYHere's a missed opportunity. Well FF15 doesn't have the best combat but it's different and in real time so it's a win win. You fight with many cool weapons and powers. You hack and slash. You can customize your friends. It maybe mapped to one button but ah hell it's pretty sick.Exploring the world is pretty dull as well as towns.Chocobo rides are preferable to driving seeing that the car just might as well be an automatic marker train that gets you from one point to another.You choice mean nothing.The quests are kinda bland.Dungeons are kinda meh. Linear.There are endless things you can do though that aren't the game.GRAPHICSProbably one of the shining things about this game and the only good part. The characters are all very high poly and have very good animations. Feels like a cutscene from Earlier FF titles like 8 or 12. Pretty particle effects and hair. Minus the dithering.The world is kind of pretty but it seems dull at times.There is a very nice art direction to it. A clean interfaceSOUNDI rather like the soundtrack. Tons of revised tunes from previous FF games to sound more modern and sweeping.Voice actors are a little annoying.CONCLUSIONLMFO get 7 or Persona 5.

The story is nonsensical and stupid, the script is extremely juvenile, there're almost constant advertising plugs being shoved in your face almost constantly for products like Coleman , Cup Noodles and American Express that have no place in a Final Fantasy game, the paid DLCs are badly made and are like afterthoughts to slap a band aid on this ill conceived disaster of a game, the characters are 1 dimensional at best, paper thin at worst, the combat and magic system is garbage, the world building makes no sense, the game is way too easy, side quests are a waste of time, character design is unimaginative and bland, summons are practically useless, there are interminable load times so frequently.

Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Deus Steps Back;I was a fan since the first game and the direct prequel by Eidos Montreal undoubtedly returned the series to greatness, after the flawed 2nd game. This sequel was highly anticipated by me and the somewhat flawed technical side of the last entry was fully fixed now. The console version got a notable downgrade from the gorgeous PC version, but the jump in graphical fidelity is still immense. The gameplay and character-building was further perfected here and the previously lame boss battles have been replaced by almost none at all, hm. The soundtrack and sound design remained on point too. The story though, an essential hallmark of the series, took a step down. I overall enjoined it, a side-story about a transhumanist cult was especially great, but I felt that I only scratched the surface for large parts of the narrative. The game is also a bit shorter than expected and story DLC is being sold during the month of release too, sigh. Not the smartest of moves to keep the fans going and the in-game purchases + the random multiplayer are about as pointless as they are harmless. I certainly saw worse in the last gen but i ultimately felt that I was "only" playing a standalone addon to Human Revolution, with a shiny new engine, in the end. 4 years of development are a bit much for this.

Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Perhaps not perfect but definitely worth playing;This game is awesome, from the bad ass augmented weapons your character has installed in his body to the stealth, the weapon modding, the cool inventory system, and the incredibly large lore/perfect length main storyline. you can't stop until you find out what happens next. I loved the location, the theme, the soundtrack, the characters it's really enjoyable. Perhaps not perfect but definitely worth playing and experiencing it's story.;9/10;2 March 2021;2 out of 11 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;Solid Cyberpunk;Took a while to get to this and gotta say I'm pleasantly suprised. The game has issues mostly being related to the convoluted and mediocre story, the weak gunplay and uslessness of credits, but outside of that this is a really solid stealth sandbox game.There are so many routes and options to approach missions and a great sense of accomplishment and progression when you find a hidden vent or manage to slip away just in time.The upgrades are all really fun and feel useful and honestly beat Cyberpunk 2077's augments in almost every aspect, all though levelling can feel a little slow at times.Honestly prefer this too the mess Cyberpunk is, and if you're looking for a more polished and focused Cyberpunk experience you honestly can't go wrong with this even with it's flaws.;7/10;13 June 2022;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;A story left unfinished and unsatisfying;The main story of Mankind Divided begins in 2029, two years after the events of the previous game Human Revolution. After the catastrophe with the bio-chips that cause enhanced humans to attack everyone, societies have split into pro- and anti-enhanced humans. The former groups began to congregate in ghettos where crime increased and the police became accustomed to abusing their powers. In an atmosphere of widespread social unrest, terrorist organizations claiming to fight for equal rights for empowered people began to emerge.In the game we again take on the role of Adam Jensen. The heavily augmented hero works for Interpol as part of the anti-terrorist group Task Force 29, and also collaborates with a group of hackers called the Juggernaut Collective. Jensen's ultimate goal is to solve the mystery of the sinister Illuminati. In subsequent missions, the two allies often have conflicting goals, forcing the player to play a game in which dangerous decisions will be made that will affect the fate of all humanity. Similar to previous games in the series, Mankind Divided gameplay is non-linear and offers a variety of approaches.The developers allow players to play in two main core ways: One is focused on action and open combat, while the other is sneaking, infiltration and silent elimination of our enemies. Enemies are now much more dangerous thanks to improved AI and the ability to work in groups. Rarely do we see a situation where the Guardians are on their own. They act in pairs against Jensen, even when patrolling nooks and crannies. On top of that, the developers have made sure that our opponents are significantly more diverse, and so we'll face opponents who use power-ups and exoskeletons as well as mechs. Much attention has been paid to improving the fighting segments against powerful enemies. During battles can now take place in a variety of ways, including sneak surprise attacks, full frontal attacks or a combination of both.Adam Jensen has also gained a number of completely new skills. The upgrades in Mankind Divided are about twice as many as in Human Revolution. The hero can now remotely hack turrets, robots and cameras, and can also almost instantly leap meters upwards over short distances. The knife on his forearm can be used for direct melee attacks or for throwing smaller projectiles. There's also a power-up that incapacitates our enemies with electricity. As we progress, we unlock access to new skills that can be used during combat, sneaking, or both. But using them drains our energy reserves. Although they partially regenerate themselves when Jensen doesn't use his enhancements, their full regeneration requires special bio-cells.Depending on our choices, the game's story can take unexpected turns in the long run. For example: In the beginning we encounter some criminals and if we choose to kill them you can be subjected to their revenge later on. Not everything is limited to this, though. The events of Mankind Divided are also influenced by the conversations we have with other characters, which allows us to resolve some conflicts only through diplomacy. This part of your gameplay becomes more detailed when you get the implant CASIE, a perk that analyzes the psychological state of the NPC during a conversation.Even though Mankind Divided has great improvements compared to Human Revolution, it was much less liked and criticized by players than Mankind Divided. While the gameplay is very enjoyable, it has to be admitted that the ending is extremely weak. The game offers an average of 25 hours of gameplay with all the side content and if you don't do the side interactions, it will be very short. Mankind Dived has the technical infrastructure to be a standalone game.But it also has a rather abrupt and uninspiring finale, more like the first episode of a game as the main story. This was one of the biggest reasons why it received negative reviews. Because according to many people, Adam Jensen's story was already completed in the previous game. The second game just left more unanswered questions and ended without tying it up. Regardless, it was one of the best series I've ever played and I'm looking forward to Eidos Montreal wrapping up Adam Jensen's unfinished story with a satisfying finale in the years to come.;7/10;23 October 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided;A great game, for like 3 hours...;I was really enjoying this game. Honestly I was. A sci-fi RPG set in a dark future, with cyborgs, adventure and guns. What's not to love right? I was having an 8/10 or higher level of fun while playing it. But then I hit about 20% og the way into the game, and realized I had been robbed. I got this game years after release, and was able to pick it up in a supermarket for the low price of £10, and I still feel totally, UTTERLY ripped off. I got to about 20% of the way into the game, to discover the credits rolling. "no" I thought to myself "there's... there's no way that's the end right? already? I mean... I only just started it? right?" I was utterly appealed at how short this game was. It's not a full release, its like an extended demo, its like A short spin-off game. I loved the world of Deus Ex, but if this is the length the games are, I'll not bother to play another again. It couldn't have been more that 8-10 hours of play, surely? For the amount of actual content, I would say this should be priced at like £4.99 brand new or something, as a short game to download on PSN. I feel stolen from that I paid so much for such a short game. I expected this to the be the end of the first act of five, not the end of the whole game. Outrageously short.;4/10;18 June 2018;3 out of 24 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Not enough missions;Personally, this game isn't that bad. There are more vehicles than jc3, and I actually prefer the graphics now, but I understand how people don't like it. Why this doesn't get 9/10 is the liberation/missions-not enough. Once, I I drove 10 cars in water and liberated the entire region. If it worked more like jc3 with destroying red objects, then liberating bases then when you liberate all bases you liberate a region. Maybe then you unlock the missions to finally liberate the region. Also, the tornadoes always end up in the same place, However I haven't checked the new update Also, they could add missions for the front line - for example, you have to go and defend otherwise you lose a small area of front line, so it feals real.;7/10;28 December 2018;11 out of 13 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;So basic and broken, at least it had a hoverboard;C tier, 6/10. Lots of good weapons and evriroments but ultimately is such a flawed and broken game. The missions are just so awful. Just cause is a game about destruction and you spend most of the time escorting prisoners. The story is abismaly basic and the villain is just so forgettable. A big business guy that I don't even remember anything else about. There is a great improvement in the tools you can use but there is not any great opportunities to use them in the story. You can use them in really fun ways in the open world feels so broken and basic. It can be really funny but just feels dated, even compared to just cause 3.I spent hours exploring it to get this really cool graffiti style wingsuit and whilst it looked great I just noticed how baron and boring the world really is. The activities you can do feel so basic and just not worth doing. I love some of the weapons such as the tornado and gravity guns but they run out of ammo so quickly they are not worth using. The dlc is honestly great. You get a hoverboard, which is the most fun thing to use. You can just zoom across land and water and it is really fun. You also get a decent story with the agency attacking, turing on Rico and actually get to destroy things. The agency ships are really fun to explore and destroy. Just feels like what the game was meant to be, especially when compared to the main story.The hoverboard races are really fun and I love customizing the board. The demonos dlc is so creative and so unique. Destroying all these weird plants and creatures. So satisfying to pop some of the pods and stuff. I really don't like timed races so the racing dlc wasn't fore but for what it wanted to do it was ok. I would honestly rated the dlc 7-8 out of 10 but the game just is so bad and is not worth it.Felt like such a step back from just cause 3. It seems I've played every just cause game except 2 which people say is the best one. I will try and get it for PS3 or see if it's on ps now or something.;6/10;17 January 2022;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Not worse than JC3.;As a fan of Just Cause 2 I actually enjoyed playing this. It was great to finally be able to explore a more diverse set of biomes again, especially since I was super bored of Medici by the end of JC3. The strongest aspect of the game has to be what they did with the grapple hook tho. All these modifications are just so much fun to f around with. I don't remember how often I built myself a flying tank to solve a mission objective instead of playing it "the normal way" (Which I guess was the point of the game to begin with).As much fun as I had, it would be unfair not to aknowledge the games short comings though. The guns are alright at best, the missions are often unimaginative and a massive missed opportunity considering what gameplay options you have and the vehicles, especially cars and boats are actually super clunky, which, sure... they always were in Just Cause Games, but this has to be a new low. The story on the other hand is taking itself a bit too serious for what it is. Just Cause 2 was self-aware and a parody of its genre but this game tries to be a bit more dramatic in it's presentation and falls flat doing so. Luckily Just Cause is one of those games you really don't play for the story, so it didn't bother me much. The game is also not well optimized and prone to crash on weaker machines, so if you plan to play this on PC be aware.Overall mixed feelings about the execution of what is essentially a really fun game. I'd give 6.5 stars if I could. If you don't care about all the problems I just named, I'm sure you'll have a great time with this. ...and for the price of 7,99 euros on MMOGA you really can't complain all that much.;7/10;10 May 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Don't like the new Base Takeover missions;To take over a base you download data from a terminal and fight off the enemies while it's downloading, compared to the others where you destroy all fuel tanks, satellites, etc. I'm 35 hours into it and it doesn't feel like I've done anything;4/10;12 January 2019;12 out of 14 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;A downgrade from Just Cause 3;In short: the game is too easy. Just run from one pointer to the next, push a button, rinse and repeat.Sure, you gun down a few enemies on the way but they're just a little nuisance.A big milestone of the JC series is the destruction of the "red" objectives, and it used to be you had to clear all of them to advance in you conquest, all the while enemies occupied that area. Now they're just there, you can destroy them but you don't really need to, after a certain point they can be completely ignored because they don have any purpose anymore: they give you troops for occupying areas, but you need 6 troops at most, after thet you just keep on accruing allies but never use them.The weapons are quite uninspired, just use whatever the enemies drop. There are (a lot of) weapon crates around the world, but they always contain the usual useless weapons, so it's quicker just picking up whatever you find, at least you know you'll get ammo refills from the enemies.The story could simply not be there. It's not a huge selling point for this game, but at least in JC3 you could care for the characters that talked to you and get a bit of a laugh here and there, now it would be better if they didn't exist at all.The graphics are not that good, and I mean the overall effect they achieve is not pleasing to the eye. Especially water and hair are so bad you just can't help but being shot out of the immersion of the game.The SSAO option simply makes the game black, there are no differences in the illumination, just a layer of black painted over the screen. In broad daylight, as soon as you enter a covered space, it becomes night. You literally cannot see 5 meter ahead of you. That would be OK if there was some kind of transition period during which your eyes get accustomed to the new lighting, but that's not the case, you are in the dark forever.;4/10;15 December 2018;13 out of 16 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;Stay in Medici;What happened?Big fan of the franchise because of the over the top destructible bases that you are required to destroy to capture new settlements for your allies, which has been a core mechanic since JC2 but Just Cause 4 does not implement this!!! To capture new bases you have to complete missions from Sargento, your militia coordinator which just feels boring. While there are still all the massive generators and propane tanks that you can still blow up, it just feels empty and pointless. Also the new grapple attachments are weird but that's a whole other can of worms. Stay in Medici, Just Cause 3 is better.;4/10;8 April 2019;11 out of 14 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Just Cause 4;A True Sequel;What do you get when you mix a huge game world, more explosions than Michael Bay's filmography, and suave, unstoppable, government agent Rico Roduiguez? You get the Just Cause franchise. And while Just Cause 4 improves many things over its predecessor, there have also been some compromises. For instance, the water in just cause has always been one of the series highlights but in 4 it has been dialed back. Overall I would not say that the game has been downgraded because while the water doesn't look as good, there is much more going on in this game and a Just Cause game has never performed so well. Whether you're blowing up an enemy base, hightailing it through a river during the middle of a lightning storm, or chasing tornadoes the frame rate remains smooth on Xbox one x. Driving vehicles has also been dramatically improved over Just Cause 3. Not that you ever need to drive a car because Rico still has his trusty grapple gun, parachute, and wingsuit to help you fly across the map without ever touching the ground. Gunplay feels as satisfying as ever although they removed Rico's legendary dual pistols from the game that he has had since the original title. Frankly I was a bit disappointed at first but after trying out many of the other weapons and finding my favorites, I no longer missed them. As for additions to the game, they have added a Frontline mechanic, which means that there is now a constant battle going on between two factions and as you do missions and take over territory the Frontline of the war constantly shifts, which adds to the immersion and sense of progress in the game world. As for the story...it has its charm. It's not as in your face silly as previous titles but it is not mature and grim either. It is a popcorn flick type story with fun characters doing crazy missions. Rico is more of a superhero at this point than a top secret agent, and he doesn't disappoint in this sequel. The game has a sense of adventure like the uncharted games, a unique open world that Just Cause is known for, and some incredible gameplay and action sequences that rival anything from the previous entries. I have waited until last to talk about the music because it is my favorite part of this game. It has a large variety, and a unique sound compared to what many other action games aspire to achieve and it works incredible well with this game. In the end, the game has imperfect graphics, stable performance, smooth controls, and an insane combination of action, charm, and breathtaking vistas which makes it a must play if you enjoyed previous entries in this series, or are wondering if it is worth checking out.;8/10;20 August 2019;5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Just Cause 4 to me was a massive disappointment, the graphics in the cutscenes were terrible no way near as good as Just Cause 3 graphics. The driving machanics in this game are very hard to control. The campaign was OK but not a satisfying one. Besides all the cons in this game the gameplay is fun and there is some cool easter eggs. The reason why I gave this a 4/10 is because it's fun to mess around in this game. I would recommend people to try out this game because this is just my opinion.;4/10;22 August 2021;2 out of 3 found this helpful.

And what's the problem with a bad story when it's a series known for gameplay rather than story. Rico is just such a good character still, and I love the new graphics. I'm a bit late, but... this is a GOOD GAME. What is one thing I miss? Town liberations. That's why I gave the game a 9/10 rather than a 10/10.;9/10;10 May 2021;3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I mean I don't play Just Cause for realism, I play it for the amazing mobility, epic explosions, vehicles, and beautiful world. So story and gunplay weren't as important to me personally. But I do understand that everyone is different, but if you aren't as in to shooting and story than I'd definitely recommend this game.

Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;My Favorite Game of the Year;Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a great ending to Lara Croft's rebooted, mature origin story. Once again the visuals are absolutely stunning, and the voice acting is top notch. I never play games until 100% completion, but I had to for this game. My only gripe with the game is the controls. More than once I had issues where I would press a button and it wouldn't register, or Lara would jump in a different direction than I intended. Also, the combat is pretty straight forward: hide, use killer instinct to see if enemies are not being watched, then stealth kill (or go guns blazing, but it's not as fun). The game has many side missions, tombs, crypts, and other collectibles to find and beat so there is more of an incentive to jump back in after the main campaign (or dive into new game +). Excellent game that I couldn't put down. If you're not a fan of the series, this won't change your mind, but damn is it fun.;9/10;24 September 2018;26 out of 29 found this helpful.

Don't even get me started on the set pieces...OHHH! Overall, looks beautiful but sometimes a little choppy. Climax felt a little too similar to the previous one and I found the ending kind of lackluster but it was still enjoyable!

Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Sublime massive platforming tomb mechanics and excellent puzzle design.;The last game of the second reboot trilogy. Eidos Montreal took over the development after the excellent 7 Tomb Raider games by Crystal Dynamics. The Shadow of the Tomb Raider focuses much more on the character of Lara as the last game of this reboot trilogy after 2 great games and it does a great job.The game focuses on massive tombs with different creative puzzles, but still retains the trademark action/stealth/puzzler game-play of the first 2 games.With even greater graphics, more developed mechanics, tons of exploring and discovering opportunities and with a very well-written scenario Shadow of the Tomb Raider, definitely is one of the best in the series.

Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Like Most Trilogies The Third One Falls Flat;I absolutely loved the rebooted Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider. I actually gave both games a 10 on IMDb. The first two games had a very natural progression for the Lara Croft character and SotTR seemed to be setting up an amazing story by having an overconfident Lara seemingly bring on the end of the world. But then the game lands in Paititi the character development comes to a screeching halt. It almost reminded me of the second season of The Walking Dead. When are we getting off of the farm/Paititi? It just dragged. Visually, the game is just as beautiful as the previous entries and if you're on the Xbox One X playing in 4K, the game is simply stunning. I really do hope we get to see this version of Lara in one more game. Uncharted 4 was an amazing send off for Nathan Drake and Lara Croft could use one more go around to send her off on the high note she deserves.

Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Great game, probably my favorite from the rebooted trilogy;Greetings from Lithuania."Shadow of the Tomb Raider" (2018) is probably one of the most if not the most underrated games of 2018. I loved the first two games highly, and i was looking forward for this 3rd and as creators said - the last in this trilogy. Now after it came out and most of the reviews said that it was the weakest in the series and many players complained about repetitiveness, bringing nothing new to the table and bla bla bla i was a bit worried. Now after completing this game at 100% and at the moment completed all new DLC i can safely say - this is probably the best Tomb Raider game ever made.I have no clue what most of the players and critics alike were complaining about. This game is fantastic from the get go till the closing title sequence. Its bigger the both previous games. It has very cool new mechanics in combat, it has more tombs - basically this game has improved on almost every aspect from previous (and those were already great!). it has Lara in the most dark and gritty story yet and even her interactions with Johnna which i found a bit boring in previous games were much more fleshed out in "Shadow".Overall, if you really liked previous two games and especially "Rise" - you will have a blast exploring this new breathtakingly beautiful open world. Its not the best game of 2018, but for me personally its very close up there with "God of War" and "Red Dead 2". I do hope Crystal Dynamics won't stop this franchise and give as something as great and exciting in near future. "Shadow of the Tomb Raider" is easily, an amazing game.;10/10;12 February 2019;13 out of 17 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Please be the last one.;I loved the first two games of the reboot. Lara was presented as a relatable person with great stories that held your interest. Unfortunately shadow lets the player down - the story drags in more than one place and even the graphics seem to have taken a dip in quality with the frame rate dropping in more than one place. I enjoyed a return to solving puzzles but the game seems to prioritize open world exploration and side missions, over a solid core story.;6/10;11 November 2018;7 out of 17 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Underwhelming;Yes, they did character work, which is great. Jonah has magically changed his entire appearance again. Lara's character model is a huge downgrade from Rise - particularly in the hair. The mud effect is cheap looking. And whoever said the ending had them "holding their breath" must have never watched a movie or played the last two games. Everything is as formulaic and predictable as possible. Also, the skill tree is a nightmare. I really wanted to like this one best... But I guess I'm just going back to the other games.;5/10;26 January 2019;19 out of 30 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Wow!!;I Love this game! The lead actress who plays Croft really stands out in this outing. As you play the game, it just gets better and better..

Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Excellent game;I absolutely loved this game. Great direction, big areas to explore without the irritations of an open world game. Fantastic cinematic scenes, excellent fast action scenes that rival Uncharted. The graphics are outstanding and the story was brilliant. Just wow! I do not have time for open world games and half the time you are trying to figure out what the heck you are supposed to do next and once you figure that out, you are sidetracked with a stupid mission. This game has none of that and I found it quite challenging as well. I highly recommend.;10/10;12 December 2018;7 out of 10 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Didn't grip me;My biggest problem with this game was its inconsistency. It had a few chapters and sequences which were brilliant, including the start of the game in Mexico which set the scene well and shaped things up nicely.After that however, the game failed to grip me to its story like I thought it would, and unfortunately the gameplay/combat either (barring a few chapters as I said). There was too much time spent scaling walls and doing other cool but eventually repetitive things which became boring after a while.Overall a solid game but would've been a higher score had more chapters been of the same standard as the opening and some other fantastic ones.;6/10;14 February 2021;2 out of 4 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Overall, excellent well-rounded game to end the trilogy;Not sure why there are so many haters to this game.There are several facets of this game which make it thoroughly enjoyable. For all those who criticize that the game does not have a novel concept, it's the 15th+ game in the Tomb Raider franchise. In many ways, you shouldn't be expecting for a completely brand new game (in fact most of us enjoy the running around, combat sequences, and puzzles aspect that we came to love).The storyline is excellent in this game. There are several side missions where you can explore the world and build up points and collect items to make the main mission easier. However, there isn't an excess of side missions to distract from the main mission either.The puzzles are great. They take some thinking but are solvable with a little persistence.The graphics and gameplay are well balanced. The Peruvian jungle and small towns are beautiful. The scenery is green, bright, and well-lit in contrast to the Siberian grey and dismal prequel (not a critique but rather just descriptive of the setting).The combat sequences are well balanced. This isn't a game with excess shooting and non stop fighting. In fact, stealth and use of the bow with strategy is paramount. It makes for a slightly more realistic game (although as a 20 year old girl, she still has quite a few hundred murders under her belt). There are weapons you can buy but each has pluses and minuses without a clear cut winner. There's not an excess of weapons which simplifies the combat portion of the game. This is similar to the prior 2 games.All and all, it is a very enjoyable game. The videos and storyline are excellent and incorporate well into a well done cinematic experience. The only critique is that the game play is a little short (but there are DLC that you can also get).;10/10;15 March 2020;4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Missing gear;Well if Lara would have just packed all her gear in one suitcase this would be a 10 out of 10. Can't enter this tomb missing gear. What? seriously? Then we walk away. Just before the end game we got the missing gear. Why do we want to go back to that tomb? Answer cause puzzles are great.The whole missing gear, base camp to base camp travel is ridiculous.;9/10;20 October 2020;3 out of 4 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Shadow of the Tomb Raider;Awesome Game let down by Shadow Hunting!;Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider games hold a special place in my heart. It was the first ever game which I played that involved 3D-Style graphics. It was the first game I played moving away from the 2D Nintendo days, on my Windows PC running Millennium, and I still remember the awe and adventure the game had to offer along with a decent story-line and an amazing lead, Lara Croft. That's why I was hugely disappointed with the Lara Croft games of the PS2 era. The controls and the game-play were really bad and it was frustrating to play them. This was until the 2013 reboot and things were looking good for Lara, especially after post-Uncharted, developers knew what needs to be done and kept pushing the boundaries. We had some really amazing games after that like God of War, The Last of Us and the 2 Tomb Raider games (Tomb Raider & The Rise Of Tomb Raider). Now, after a long wait, we have the third instalment, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider. I couldn't have been more excited so I pre-ordered the game and was one amongst the first to get my hands on it.So around 20+ hours of game-play later, I was left with mixed-feelings. Once again, the issue being game-play and the dynamics on which the platform is designed. We are living in the era of games like Uncharted and The Last Of Us, so anything less brilliant is not acceptable. Sadly, the new Tomb Raider game is not as fluid as the ones from Naughty Dog and the game-play, especially the shadow-hunting feels underwhelming.So lets me get the bad out of the way. The major action sequences in the Shadow Of The Tomb Raider rely on stealth attacks. There is no option for you to go guns blazing as the enemy will gut you in seconds if you do so. So you have to stick to the shadows, muddy walls and dense bushes to make your silent move. About 90% of the action is based on this technique and it really feels very inconsistent. You can sometimes take out guards who are very close-by to others as the system cues that he is out of sight and at other times you get spotted even when you take out a guard who is isolated from everyone. There was this once where I hid against a muddy wall and took out a pack of 10 soldiers from the same spot as they kept coming seeing the first body on the ground but filed to spot Lara. This felt very funny and almost like a bug in programming.Then the cover-aim-to-shoot, this is almost non-existent. This is a technique which Uncharted series mastered and in this game, it is almost non-existent. You kind of get in back in maybe 2 action sequences in the end and this makes you feel what this game was missing right from the beginning.Then the visibility of the shadows, the game is very dark so make sure you play in a dark room or crank up the brightness as most of the areas are very poorly lit.When you are not hunting from the shadows, you are taking obstructions and animals head-on. Here the combat style reverts back to the 90s. You leap, run, jump and run just like the old games. There is nothing clever or innovative here.Finally, the platforming, even this is very inconsistent. When Lara is reaching out for the ledges between the gaps, it always feels like she is aiming in the wrong direction. The navigation is not smooth or fluid and at times it feels a bit frustrating. Like this one jump, where she had to jump and throw the rappel and jump again. I must have played this over 50 times to get it right. It is not the first time in the game doing that or even a tricky jump, it was a simple one but for some reason, just that one jump needs to be done in the right angle, at the right time with the right camera view. It almost felt like a bug. Not sure if I was the only one who had this issue! Added to that, the loading time, I thought the technology has advanced to that level where the loading times are mostly non-existent but in this game, it really feels substantial. It almost takes about 50 seconds to a minute to load the game if you die in game-play. That is really bad. Big games like God of War or Uncharted 4 didn't have such loading times!Ok, that's quite a few negative points but what can I do. The recent similar adventure-style game which I played was Uncharted: Lost Legacy and that game was amazing in comparison. It was not even the main one, it was a spin-off based on Uncharted series and everything in that game was simply brilliant.Now, let me talk about the positives. Playing as Lara is always a delight and this time, it was no less. You cannot stop loving her character and making sure that she succeeds in everything. The childhood Lara level was brilliant and right up Uncharted alley. But sad that there is only one of such level leaving you wanting for more. The puzzles are well designed and take a bit of time but completing them is satisfactory. The environment and sound design is top notch. You can feel the lush jungles of Peru, the crystal clear waters and abundant wildlife roaming around. The main story-line was decent and the tribes you encounter in the caves were truly terrifying. There is a nod to old-time Lara where you can change you character to the one from Angel of Darkness or older games, but the novelty quickly wears off making you wonder about the advancements we have in the graphics department! Another thing brought back from the old games is Lara's encounter with wild-life. You hunt down Panthers, wrestle with Eels and evade deadly Piranhas.Camilla Luddington does an amazing job as Lara, especially playing her for the third-time and it was a delight to watch Lara emerge as this bad-ass from flaming waters. The cinematic action sequences are awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats.So, its really a shame that the game-play lets you down otherwise this game would have been a straight 10. After the first 2, I was hoping that the 3rd one would be even better but sadly, this is not the case. The shadow hunting is really inconsistent and had this been just one or two levels, it would have been fine but you have to put up with this for over 90% of the game's action.Still, I would recommend this game as how many times do you get to take an amazing, exciting journey with the gorgeous Lara Croft, which makes you feel that you are not just watching a Hollywood blockbuster but also playing it?? So, if you put up with the little inconsistencies you will have an amazing time!;7/10;17 September 2018;4 out of 17 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Beautiful;I do agree that there was a little bit of a political agenda and that in places it's a little bit too obvious or exaggerated - but this game was absolutely magnificent.

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Criminally underrated game;7.2?!? I normally don't give games a perfect 10, cause there's always something to take away from a game. In this case though, LiS2 deserves a far better spot than 7.2.It is easily the better title with a greater focus on character development between the protagonist and his brother. Not to mention, it serves as a good roadtrip movie which for me, is a far more interesting environment than the school.Naturally the first one was a murder mystery. Here, it's more about hard choices while trying to hold onto your morality.I feel the low ratings come from those who not only wanted a similar game to LiS1 but those who were also trapped in its nostalgia.;10/10;20 September 2021;18 out of 22 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Best game I have played in 30 years of my life;Life Is Strange 2 is more than a game. It is a piece of art.There are no dragons to slay or spaceships to maneuver. It is just about two boys from Seattle learning to survive in post-Trump USA.Teenager Sean Diaz and his little brother Daniel flee their home into the forests of Washington state after a brutal accident that leaves their single father dead. Through their long journey south, the two of them navigate homelessness, police brutality, racism, grief, death, loss, family, friendship, the kindness of strangers, and the intense natural beauty of the American wilderness.Playing as Sean, the de facto guardian of Daniel, you learn the gentle art of parenting. You learn to play with your little brother, even when fed up and starving. You learn to bear with temper tantrums, because you know he is just a little kid. You learn to shield someone from the brutalities of the real world by taking on burdens of your own.What really sets the game apart from watching a movie is the fact that you as player are responsible for its characters. In movies, you know from the outset, the main characters will live to experience a happy ending, because producers have paid millions for a top-notch actor to show their face and every minute counts. In LIS2, the main characters can screw up and never recover. Because the consequences of player choice only materialise hours or days after they are made, you cannot simply reload and watch a different ending.In my whole life, I have never played a game like this. Even a person like me who works with issues of poverty, health, and inequality found dormant emotions inside me of compassion, sorrow, and love that had been numbed out by the daily grind. It made me smile, laugh, stare in shock, howl, and cry. It made me question my life, my place in the world, and my relationship with the many vulnerable people that inhabit it.I cannot recommend playing this game highly enough to seasoned gamers and newcomers alike. Trust me, it will transform you.;10/10;17 December 2019;42 out of 57 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Whilst few positives, it's ultimately disappointing.;The story of Life is Strange 2 follows the two Diaz brothers, Sean and Daniel, ages 16 and 9, respectively, on their journey from Seattle, the USA to their father's home town of Puerto Lobos, Mexico.Whilst I was a massive fan of both LIS1 and LISBTS, I found this game to be rather lacking in comparison. It's a game with noble intent without the skills to fulfil its potential, showing that sometimes life isn't strange, but disappointing. I found the two leads unlikable, whilst the brotherly bond between them had nice moments, the characters' motivations were questionable. Due to the road movie approach, the secondary characters also lack depth. The attitude of the protagonists is not credible and you do not empathize with them most of the time. The game is rather heavy-handed at times with its religious and political messages too. Also, winks to pop culture, hallmarks of the entire saga, almost disappear. The music is not remarkable. Because of these issues, I found the game felt long and rather boring, even though it's a relatively short game. Only some surprising moments save it from being completely unlikable. Hopefully LIS: True Colours can be the saving grace for the series.;6/10;27 March 2021;17 out of 31 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;A bad version of Life is Strange;This review is about Episode 1.Life is Strange Season 1(!) is a unique and one of the best games out there. If you remotely like adventure games, scifi or drama, you will love LiS. So of course every fan impatiently waited for Season 2 to arrive.Some were a bit disappointed by the decision not to continue with Max & Chloe, but the devs opinion, the story was told and it was time for something new.While this game still feels like Life is Strange on the first look, I can't help but say that there is still something essential missing. Season 1 was taking a mature stance on things, challenging our views and decisions, having an impactful storyline and drawing characters in different shades. Season 2 falls completely flat on that part (for now).You got a well working moral "caring-system" for your brother, which will influence his fate, but that's about it. The story makes no sense at best. i do not want to spoiler, but one question sums it up: "Why are they doing this?" The lead characters are sympathic, but not more than the side characters on Season 1. And the worst: all the other characters come along as stereotypical as it gets. Everyone on the country is a racist. Police is trigger happy and racist. Neighbours are... racist. The only good guy is a poor version of Michael Moore. So in the end, there might be an answer to the "why" - but it does not get any better as it is: "because everybody is racist". Point.This is just so not Life is Strange. Life is Strange is known for elaborating on characters and why they act the way they do. Instead, LiS must have a Trump-Trauma and uses Season 2 as SJW-lecture.So sad. :);5/10;20 December 2018;36 out of 85 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Not as good as the first but massively underrated;One of the main reasons why most fans didn't like this it's because this is not a follow up to max and chloe's story which is unfair and yeah the voice acting and dialogue is kinda weak specially the main protagonist (sean) it's not flawless but even so, the story and characters are really good, it's much more longer and bigger than the original life is strange and it's very grounded, this game also started out a lot more emotional than the first episode of season 1 which is fitting since this game is goes for a darker and more miserable story.One of the main flaws of season 1 was the fact that the final episode was really rushed and disjointed (lis bts suffers even more from this issue) but not this game since it has several endings and surprisingly this is the only lis game that have your choices actually impact the ending you get, that's a huge improvement for the series.Now of course nothing is perfect and this game has some pacing and story issues, for example i wanted more out of chris (captain spirit) since he had his own little game, another thing is that the cast and the setting constantly change in the game and while that makes things fresh it makes it hard to get into the side characters since they won't stay for long but other than that the relationship between the two brothers is the heart and soul of this game and that never change.Overall this is a great game that if you go with the right expectations it can bring out a lot of feelings out of you, definitely a lot better than the scores would tell you.;10/10;22 November 2018;52 out of 81 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Please don't hate on it just because it doesn't have max or chloe;People have to understand that the devs were done with Max and Chloe's story. It was a complete story with a satisfying end. They even gave a comic book series to calm the fans bashing Lis2 for not having M&C. This game is different and equally well written as its predecessor. Even better IMO. Also, the longer wait between episodes is due to the longer gameplay, improvered graphics , different locations with different episodes , demanding budget etc. I was immediately connected to the Diaz brothers and their journey for survival. I like seeing new characters and their interaction with Daniel. It is a wonderful game and I look forward to further episodes. I just request everyone to play the game first instead if hating on it automatically. I am sure you will change your mind :);10/10;24 May 2019;37 out of 59 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Amazing Graphic Designs and Imaginative Soundtrack but Average Characters and Predictable Plot;Life Is Strange 2 is the third entry in the episodic graphic adventure video games where the players' decisions determine the twists and turns in the story. This video game consists of five episodes of roughly four hours each that have been released between September 2018 and December 2019. The physical release also includes The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit based upon a side character of the main game. It's the same game genre but should rather be seen as a side quest that takes not more than two hours to complete.The main story revolves around teenage brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz. A terrible series of misunderstandings leading to a deadly accident force the two brothers to run away from their home in Seattle right from the start. The older brother tries to guide his younger brother Daniel as the latter discovers that he has telekinetic powers. Throughout the story, the brothers will have the choice to use or not to use these powers which may lead to very different outcomes. This coming-of-age tale about family, forgiveness, friendship, hatred and love leads the duo through numerous challenges across the United States of America from Washington over Oregon, California and Nevada to Arizona.This game convinces on a few levels. The story certainly has some philosophical depth as it's interesting to see the two lead characters grow through their challenges. The settings are particularly interesting from lush wildlife in Cascadia to the desert wasteland in Nevada and Arizona. The game's appeasing alternative pop and rock soundtrack is enchanting as usual. The game's finale certainly leaves an impression as well.However, this game is not without its flaws. Due to the changing settings, the game doesn't have the same enigmatic atmosphere as its predecessors. The story line also offers few surprises and especially only plods along in the second, third and fourth episodes. Several episodes have unnecessary lengths that don't add anything to the characters or story. The repetitive wolf tales that the older brother tells the younger one are rather childish. Speaking of the two lead characters, I couldn't empathize as much with them as with the female characters from the two preceding games. Their actions, choices and motivations were at times very strange throughout the game to say the least.This game could probably please empathic teenage boys more than anyone else. To be honest, this game offers more of the same to the franchise without leaving a significant mark. Unconditional fans can play this game without any regrets but occasional fans or newcomers can skip this release and should focus on the first release in the franchise instead.;7/10;21 March 2022;3 out of 6 found this helpful.
Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;One of my favorite games of all-time;I'm very surprised by the overall rating of this game (6.7/10) I loved Life is strange 1 as much as I'm sure a lot of other people playing this game do, too. But, in my opinion, this one blows the first one out of the water. I loved this game since the very first episode (and not to mention Caption Spirit was a great 'teaser') I loved how they tied into each other. This isn't really a spoiler, but LIS1 had just 2 endings (which, depending on what ending you chose, everything else didn't REALLY matter), but in this one, you have 7 endings. Yes, SEVEN. I was shocked by all the different endings and to be honest, it's still effecting me. The complex relationship of these two brothers was just incredible. All the trials and issues they have to face on a daily basis. I hear people saying that everyone is in this game are are overly 'evil' but, I mean, they are Hispanic kids. Unless you are Hispanic living in today's United States, you have no room to talk. This game perfectly captures what it's like to do something on accident and kill someone, and then be immediately guilty because of their ethnicity. I digress. If you liked the first game, play this one. You will not be disappointed, as long as you can have an open mind.;10/10;8 December 2019;18 out of 27 found this helpful.

Square Enix;Life is Strange 2;Melts my heart.;Life Is Strange is my favourite story based game of all time, the art style, peaceful atmosphere, and story is what did it for me. However, Life Is Strange 2 seems to be exactly that, with an even more hauntingly beautiful story. The journey of the Wolf Brothers is absolutely fantastic, I shed so many tears playing this game. Will easily make you as emotional as the first one. So be prepared.Life Is Strange 2 is the story of 2 brothers, Sean and Daniel, you play as Sean and have to protect your brother no matter the obstacles that are thrown in your way, as they attempt to escape to Mexico.They travelled through hell and back, but they did it together, as brothers. What makes this game different from the first one is that the game depicts real life situations in a very relatable way, and I think that's the main reason why I think this game is stronger than the first.I loved this game so much.

Capcom;Resident Evil 3;In depth review - The positives outweigh the negatives;Resident Evil is my favorite series of video games. I have played almost all of them except the Umbrella shooters and the ones that uses a light gun. They all vary in terms of quality, but there is not a Resident Evil (mainline) game that I would call downright bad and unplayable.Resident Evil 3 Remake had a lot to live up to following the masterpiece Resident Evil 2 Remake. I feel that REmake3 is a good update to the original game but it does have some flaws that keep it from being a total masterpiece.* FIRST off, don't let the other online reviewers lie to you, this game it NOT a BAD GAME. Whoever is saying this game is terrible is just trolling or looking to jump on the hate train (ahem, Steam forum users). The Critical Drinker's review was nothing but fan service and he was just trying way too hard to be funny and appeal to the masses, same thing with Angry Joe giving this game a low 6/10. Sure this game is only less than 5 hours, but not every games needs to be padded out to 100+ hours you unhealthy fools!+ The graphics are even better than REmake2 and the environments in the first 1/3 look amazing. Getting a chance to explore the city while it is in ruins is awesome and eerie. Imagine the beginning of RE2 but a lot bigger.+The voice acting and sound effects are great too. You can actually hear music now and it gets you pumped to blow some zombie brains out.+Fun fast pace gameplay with lots of different guns to kill the undead with.+A lot of different difficulties to choose from (more than 5, compared to RE2's 3 difficulty).+Some fun stuff to unlock including special items, costumes, artwork, character models, and special weapons.+A lot of challenges to complete.-The first thing everybody will tell you is that this game is very short, I beat it in 4:45 my first time playing it.-The Nemesis character is greatly disappointing and nowhere near as scary or intimidating as MR.X was in RE2. Nemesis is very scripted (even though Nemesis was also very scripted in the original too), and he only appears during certain times in the first 3rd of the game.-Nemesis changes his form too quickly. In the original game Nemesis did not mutate until very late in the game, but in this game Nemesis mutates about 1/3 of the way and he becomes some sort of four legged beast monster.-As of release, there are no extra modes after beating the game. Usually Resident Evil would give you a mini-game to play around with after beating it (Battle Mode, 4th Survivor Mode, or Mercenaries). You do get Resident Evil Resistance though, which is cool. They will probably release stuff down the line as DLC (hopefully free).Overall this game is NOT THE BAD GAME some Steam reviewers are claiming it to be. It does not deserve a 53/100 from PC Gamer. This game is very fun and very fast pace. It feels like an action movie honestly. It is not scary and I only jump maybe once or twice when I wasn't expecting an enemy.8/10 (maybe a 9/10 if Capcom releases DLC for it);8/10;4 April 2020;22 out of 29 found this helpful.
Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Really enjoyed the game;RE3 remake is well made, graphics are amazing, gameplay is uncanny and storyline is incredible. One down side for the game is that it's a short one. I enjoyed RE2 remake more just 'cause I got to play it more. Still, RE3 was remade nicely. 9/10.;9/10;3 April 2020;18 out of 25 found this helpful.
Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Another incredible RE remake from Capcom!;First of all I ADORED the Resident Evil 2 remake from last year. Stunning graphics, great character designs/voice acting and incredible gameplay all came together to form the perfect Resident Evil experience. It's a masterpiece, pure and simple. The likes of which the franchise hadn't seen since Resident Evil 4.Now here's Capcom's from scratch remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Does it deliver? In my opinion it does and then some. Like RE2, the graphics are beautiful and the detail within the settings and characters are truly remarkable while gameplay once again is top notch. I'm honestly very surprised at how many people have complained about the tone and pace of this one. Is it faster and more chaotic? Yes. Is it more action driven? Without a doubt. But is it still a kick ass game with plenty of replay value? 100%. I get that the game isn't as long as most of us would have liked but judging from the game we did get I couldn't be more pleased with the results. If RE2 was the Resident Evil 4 of the modern remake then RE3 is hands down the Resident Evil 5 of the two(more action driven, chaotic etc) and I love it!;10/10;10 April 2020;14 out of 19 found this helpful.
Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Good fun but not as good as resident evil 2 remake.;The game was a fun remake of resident evil 3. The game could have had more that would have made it better. Still I had a good time with it. The parts with Nemesis were the best.;7/10;19 June 2021;5 out of 7 found this helpful.
Capcom;Resident Evil 3;A little bit of a step down.;I really enjoyed the RE2 remake last year even as someone who has never been crazy about Resident Evil.Just like that one, this game has outstanding atmosphere and graphics that sell it as an immersive horror action game. However, RE3 doesn't really bring anything new to the table besides a convienet dodge button. It's gameplay loop is very simple: explore and gather resources while choosing your battles wisley so you can advance to the next areas. If all that generally sounds like fun, it probably will be for you.The big issue with this game is the length. Even with some dying and struggling, I beat the game just under 4 hours. This game doesn't have the replayability of RE2 with it's multiple character story modes. Yes it comes with a multiplayer mode, but Resistance is not something I see most people sticking with for very long.As for the games story, fans will love it, but it's pretty basic in reality and rather predictable at times. There are also a couple of moments that I think don't work or make sense, especially one at the end.It's a pretty good game overall, but for the next one, I expect more creativity and risk taking from the devs.;7/10;10 April 2020;7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Stellar;I was initially put off from playing this because of GameSpot's poor review. However, I am coming to trust GameSpot more and mare. They botched The Ascent's review as well...With that said, RE3 remake is every bit as fun as the original from my memory. The replay value is great, especially with the shop and challenges. There's a lot of lore hidden. And the nice tie in to RE2 is done very well.The game came be sped through quickly. However, if you slow down and appreciate all the intricate details, it plays like RE2 but with beefier weaponry.The visuals are outstanding. Especially on PS5.Play it.;8/10;11 November 2022;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Capcom;Resident Evil 3;A Crushing Disappointment;Let me clarify, I think Resident Evil 2 (Remake) is the best Resident Evil game, overtaking Resident Evil 4 even. I loved that game so much and couldn't wait for this game. Bigger and better I thought. I was wrong. If anyone tells you this is the best resident evil game they are lying or don't know video games. Lets start with the good.Gameplay, graphics,atmosphere is all fantastic. It has an enhanced experience from RE2, the nemesis himself is one of the scariest enemies of ever faced in a game, very challenging but very fair and rewarding at the same time. Now the bad.I beat the main story in 3 hours and 20 minutes. let me repeat that 3 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES. For Comparisons sake, Leon's story took me 6 hours and Claire's took me 5 hours, and those were 2 separate campaigns in the same game. There's only 1 in RE3 and the worst part. There is absolutely nothing after the main story, not another campaign no mercenaries or ghost survivor like the last game there is quite literally no replayability. It doesn't help that the game is really easy at the halfway point. Jill's 3nd weapon is literally a grenade launcher that evaporates pretty much every enemy in the game, and Carlo's has an assault rifle in all his segments, meaning taking care of ordinary zombies is a legit walk in the park, losing its survival horror feeling.Despite those negatives 3 hours of gameplay was absolutely fantastic. If it was even 2 hours longer I'd recommend it but as it stands you'll be spending full price for a 3-4 hour experience. If you love Resident Evil, wait for it to go on sale. With its lack of content its not worth full price.Let me clarify another thing. Nobody and I mean nobody should be spending full price for such a short experience. As much as I hate to say it, don't buy it. wait for a sale or don't buy it at all.;6/10;3 April 2020;17 out of 43 found this helpful.

Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Waste opportunity;Pros:better graphics Downgrades :poor animations in the zombies without physics, scripted nemesis, without gore(that means you can't dismember zombies but only explode the head like 4 and 5 which was 10 year ago), the absent some of the most iconic areas of Re3 like clock tower and without dlc like mercenaries e.t.c. Thus,the conclusion is a average game (more like bad clone of Re2 with some new mechanics) with nothing to gain from it. At least for me.;7/10;6 April 2020;5 out of 11 found this helpful.
Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Awesome, great remake of one of the best games in the trilogy, and fast paced.;(5 out of 5 stars).Resident Evil 3 is a fresh and awesome remake to the original game RE 3 Nemesis. I am a huge fan of the series. And I think this game lived up to the original and it's previous remake of re 2. Where to start. There are some differences between the remake and original. But nothing disappointing. The remake is fast paced. It puts Jill Valentine right into action. The T virus outbreak is breaking loose into the city. Umbrella lets loose the nemesis. Which puts Jill in a while chase in the beginning. The nemesis design is awesome looking as he evolves throughout the game and the looks changes every time he runs into Jill. I do feel like the original game was still scarier with Nemesis chasing Jill room to room. The remake he does the same which is more intense than scary. Cause he runs faster.The plot is great in the game. Jill is trying to escape the apocalyptic city of zombies. Monsters. And nemesis. With the help from Carlos and his team. The plot is fast paced. It never slows down.The events in the remake is similar to original. There are less boring puzzles. The setting of raccoon city is amazing looking. The game also plays a brief visit at the police station. The clock tower is briefly in the game but the conflict with Jill and Nemesis is in there. The remake did cut out the graveyard setting and substituted the climatic factory setting with an underground Umbrella laboratory which was great. The climax lives up to the original with Jill and Nemesis.The game play is a lot of fun and awesome. There are some intense moments. With facing a horde of zombies. Or hunters. Or a big gamma monster. The remake also is missing out on the grave digger worm. The game play is more flexible with controlling the character. I love how the game play is which gives you more freedom like avoiding the zombies from grabbing you by dodging. It was the one thing that was missing in the last game.I loved how the remake brought back some of the music score from the original in this game which was awesome. It was also what was missing in the last game. The graphics are awesome. The design on Jill. Carlos. The settings. And nemesis is impressive. The controls are great and easy to handle.The game is fast moving and fast paced. I did completed the game around 5 hours. I was never bored at any moment in the game. Either from running and battling through nemesis or walking through eerie hallways with zombies. Capcom is doing great in these remakes. The second game was fun. I loved resident evil 3 more and think it's one of the best games in the series. I really wish capcom can try to remake resident evil code Veronica game which would be fun to see. If they do remake re 4. Maybe they can make it different from the original which I did not care for re 4 through 6 which the tone changed into an action packed game.Overall, Resident Evil 3 is awesome. It is a beautifully done remake that lived up to the original. It's fast paced. The graphics and game play is fun and exciting. It does have some intense moments. The plot. The gameplay is worth playing through it again. And I can't wait to see where capcom does next with resident evil.;10/10;16 April 2020;8 out of 14 found this helpful.
Capcom;Resident Evil 3;A missed opportunity.;"Resident Evil 3" feels like a very rushed game. The graphics are worse than the two previous games, dialogue feels choppy, and the story is close to nothing. It's, sadly, just as silly and ridiculous as you'd expect.

Capcom;Resident Evil 3;Good, but the game could have been better;Ok, Resident Evil 3 is pretty good, but it is too short, unfortunately. I've missed more puzzles, more horror, more action... I haven't played the original game, but I've already seen some videos on Youtube and the remake is very different. Lots of important scenarios, bosses and enemies were removed. Besides, the original game was more detailed, such as Dario's story, and had more puzzles, like Clock Tower's part. I really hope Capcom will add some DLC to make the game longer and more enjoyable.;8/10;22 May 2020;3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Capcom;Devil May Cry 5;Best Devil May Cry!;I really love Dmc one of my favourite Game Franchises, for me the Best one of the old Games is DMC 3 Dantes Awakening. i really love the Gameplay Style and Everything of the Games. Soo now the 5th has 3 Playble Charakters and Every one of them are really Amazing! V. With his Demons is really cool to play he comands them from a distance to attack the enemy and you just need to evade Enemy attacks. Nero from DMC4 is also here and he has Devil Breaker Arms and there are soo diffrent in effects and style my favourite beeing the Punch Line. But the best too play as becouse of the diffrent Swords and Guns to use and the 4 playstyles you can choose as, its like a dance that you have to master. This Game has the best Gameplay in an Hack n Slash and i recommend you to play it as well! Also if you liked the other Games you will like the Story, but to understand it you need the knowledge of the first 4 Games and dont skip the Credits, if you do so, you will not see the After Credits Scene.;10/10;11 March 2019;6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Capcom;Devil May Cry 5;Dmc is revived after a poor fourth game and reboot with a fun slash rock action game.;Devil May Cry 5 (4 out of 5 stars).Devil May Cry 5 is back and an improvement over the fourth game which was forgettable. And a boring reboot. Dmc is back with a lot of fast paced action and slash em up fighting. Introduces a new character V. Which he is playable as well as Nero and Dante.The plot is decent with this sequel. The first game will always be the best. Along with the third and second game. It takes place in one day with a few flash backs. But the story never stays in one place with bouncing around between characters. The game begins with Nero. Facing against a new threat Uniziel or something like that. Which he is causing chaos and destroying what looks to be england. Then, a new mysterious character V is introduced. Who uses his magical powers of a black demonic crow and panther to fight the enemies for him. The best part of the storyline is Dante which shows up in the middle of the game. I enjoy playing Dantes missions more than the other characters. There is a twist in the story about the villain.The gameplay is fast paced. And a lot of fun. Each character has their own combat style. Nero took a while to get used too. V was a lot of fun but got boring after a while. Dante is fun with getting a lot of new weapons and swords. The characters are fun with the storyline. Trish and Lady being back into the fold with Dante. The villain is menacing and powerful. But when his identity is revealed. I liked how the twist folds back to Dante.The controls are easy to use and handle. I did find the camera movements to be annoying when you have to force move it to see your enemies on the other side. The graphics are awesome and amazing. The cutscenes story was great with cheesy dialogue.Overall, Devil May Cry 5 is a good action slashing game. A lot of new enemies. New characters. Dantes game play is still the best. The plot is forgettable which is the weakest of the game. But the gameplay is a lot of fun.;8/10;26 March 2020;2 out of 7 found this helpful.
Capcom;Devil May Cry 5;All Synced Into A Masterpiece;Absolutely Incredible. Huge fan of the series, especially this one. The graphics, characters, story telling, soundtrack, etc. All synced into a masterpiece. I would recommend to any fan of action games with lots of fighting, I also love how the 3 characters have their own unique fighting styles which mixes up the gameplay well.

Now I'm eagerly waiting for 6th installment.;9/10;8 February 2021;2 out of 21 found this helpful.
Capcom;Devil May Cry 5;Only Worth Playing As Dante And Vergil;How can people tell me that this game is the best in the series? I think not. They don't have a problem with Dante being on the sideline for half the game. I'd rather play DMC2 instead of playing Nero and V because those characters are overrated and so BORING.I'm a huge DMC fan when I get to play as Dante for 4 games (except the reboot), but when it comes to DMC5, I am utterly disappointed because it feels like Itsuno or Capcom had to make Dante a playable cameo protagonist and you only get to play as him for 6-7 missions. Yep, our favorite Devil Hunter star is being replaced by 2 nonexistent protagonists that we didn't ask for. Believe me, I've seen lots of people playing as Dante on YouTube with his banger gameplay is top notch with his Sin Devil Trigger, and 5 weapons.What's wrong with Nero? Nero's gameplay is slowed like a turtle and very repetitive. Nothing but his lame weapons do any damage, and it gives me a migraine every time I had to S rank mission 8 thanks to the broken scoring system. His costume design is trash, look like he slept with homeless women for 12 weeks straight. Devil arms? Useless.V makes me feel like I'll never pick up the controller ever again. I know he's Vergil's human side, but he's God awful to play or watch. It's really hard to control his pets because his controls are so bad. He can't fight, but his pet demons can. On higher difficulties, his pets will get stalemated, and you have to summoned Nightmare every time you have to deal with annoying enemy designs. It takes like 25-30 minutes to get an S rank because of his nonexistent gameplay. And I can't believe these fanboys actually liked him with his terrible gameplay and Shakespeare quotes. More like he looks like Not My Rodrick actor.Vergil is literally broken. It's like Capcom gave him too much OP. Man, I had a blast playing as Mister Storm Approaching.Dante and Vergil are the best characters. I pretend Nero and V doesn't exist.;4/10;21 May 2024;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Capcom;Street Fighter V;DLC the Videogame;I waited half a year to get the game (from my library), to have actual content on my hands, but the original assessment from the community still stands. This isn't a full price game and this is coming for a 2 decade Street Fighter fan. That you need to unlock the now released returning (!) fighters and stages with actually money, as the amount of in-game currency you get for playing the game soon turns into a joke, is further unacceptable. The now released story mode isn' t good either. I wouldn't usually care, but I need to play something besides survival in the single-player portion. Seriously, it's either that or 2 equally uninteresting story modes! Even the new character designs proved problematic. Cammy's story costume, that consists of a military jacket as the top and panties as the bottom, takes the cake. Get it together C(r)apcom, this isn't DOA.... and DOA 5 is better too. The actual fighting engine is great, but nothing is wrong with one in (Ultra) Street Fighter IV either. Everyone who isn't a hardcore fan should stick with that game and the rest of us will get V once the price becomes low enough for the amount of content to be worth it. Online players will still be the only ones who will stick around for long. Evolve Stage 2 recently showed how this game should look like, so there are no more excuses. The actual gameplay is great but supporting greedy nonsense as this can only harm the franchise in the long run. Update: 2 years passed and the game was now relaunched as the Arcade Edition. The in-game economy is even worse and most modes don´t give you rewards as basic xp anymore. The story mode from last year sucked completely and the new arcade mode is just alright BUT i can now recommend buying the "Arcade Edition", as it feature enough content to pass as a retail game. SF V is still a lesser release in the series but an additional score point is warranted. 7,5/10;6/10;20 January 2018;9 out of 11 found this helpful.

Capcom;Street Fighter V;Disappointingly light on content;The core gameplay of Street Fighter V is enjoyable, but there just isn't enough here to recommend. The main story is locked until you download additional content(!), and so I first checked out the character stories. I was disappointed to find just how short these were. The typical character story consists of four single-round fights sandwiched between a series of brief cutscenes.During my time playing Street Fighter V, I also noticed how heavily the game subjects the player to advertisements, promotions and pop-ups. A free-to-play game may get a pass for this, but it's really inexcusable in a game that I've had to buy.There's considerably less value for money in this game than other fighters - unless you're a die-hard Street Fighter fan, I'd advise you to check out something like Mortal Kombat X or SoulCalibur VI.;5/10;21 February 2023;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Magnificent: One of the best games I have ever played;Wow. This game is truly astounding. I went into playing this game not really knowing what to expect, although I had heard good things about it. I have never played any of the first two Witcher games either. I have to admit, it was a weird transition from Bloodborne to the Witcher 3 because of the significant difference in pacing. However, they're two completely different games and the Witcher certainly proved itself to me. From the amazing sceneries to the engaging story, this game is definitely praiseworthy. However, the most compelling part of the story for me was definitely the characters. The character development in this game is amazing, and I truly began to feel a sense of comfort and love for nearly all of the characters. I loved the characters and lore of this game so much, in fact, that I actually played through the game multiple times, covering the main story and various side quests. It is very easy to put in over 150 hours into this game, as I have put in at least 500. Furthermore, I bought all of the books that the game series was based on and I am currently reading them with delight. If buying the entire book series simply because the game was incredible doesn't convince you that this is definitely a worthy buy, then I don't know what will. This game does not fail to impress and I can't wait for the upcoming DLCs. Hopefully you give it a shot, because it is definitely worth your time and money.

CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;The greatest gaming experience of my life;When I finish a game, I never start it again straight away, typically leaving at least a few weeks between playthroughs. Often I never even return to it. 'The Witcher 3' was the exception. As soon as I completed it, I launched it again on Death March (i.e. very hard) difficulty, and began my journey once again. Why did I break my habit of shelving a completed game? The answer: 'The Witcher 3' has *everything*.In Geralt's third and probably final appearance as a game protagonist, we're taken on an unforgettable adventure. The basic premise of this game is actually very simple: find Ciri. Ciri is a friend of Geralt and the Kaer Morhen Witchers, and she is in grave danger when all the signs indicate that the Wild Hunt are attacking. Supporting this story, as you may expect in a fantasy RPG, is a huge number of side quests. What you may not expect, though, is just how good these can be!Whilst the Wild Hunt and the myriad other antagonists certainly contribute to 'The Witcher 3' in a brilliant way, I believe that it's the people we get to know (and reunite with, in some cases) who really bring this fantasy to life. Several supporting characters, who would almost certainly receive rather superficial and unsympathetic treatment in a lesser RPG, are written and performed incredibly vividly and imaginatively. One such character is a man you'll meet relatively early in the game - the Bloody Baron.This couldn't be done, of course, without strong writing. I'd also say, though, that Doug Cockle and the rest of the cast give some outstanding performances - arguably the best I've ever seen in a game. I admit to having never really cared much about the quality of voice acting in a video-game, but 'The Witcher 3' has raised the bar substantially.You'll connect with 'The Witcher 3', its plot and its many characters, but that isn't all this game offers. The exploration is truly great, too. From the hectic and troubled town of Novigrad, to the brutal mountains and desperate settlements of the Skellige Islands, no two places in this game are alike, and everywhere you go you'll find a story worth hearing.The game mechanics are very smooth (which is important in some boss fights!), and the interface is accessible for people who don't really care to learn the intricacies of potions, crafting, augmentation and the like.Overall, this game has provided the most incredible gaming experience I've ever participated in, and I recommend this to... just about everyone!;10/10;21 February 2017;65 out of 73 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;My favorite game of this generation;It's such an amazing experience with tons of quests and stuff to do in it's world, you literally live in it for a good 150 hours (with the expansion packs) yet still it's possible to miss out on some things and you will be quite sad when it's all over.it has one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard in any video game, from sad and beautiful to epic and bone chilling and the background music not only makes it more immersive but feels like you are right at home.the characters feel alive and realistic and what you choose to say to them will actually effect the outcome of the game eventually, side quests in this game have character and story arc's better than most games out there, the mini game (gwent) is so good an easy to learn you will spend hours on it alone and so on...the only problem in this game are the bugs but if you get the goty or complete edition you'll be good to go because it's the definitive versions of the game and it has little to no bugs plus all the must have dlc's of the game. 10/10 one of the greatest experiences you can ever have with a videogame.;10/10;25 February 2019;36 out of 39 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Masterpiece;Greetings from Lithuania.Oh, my, God. What a game, What an adventure. "The Witcher III" is easily the best game not only in 2015, it is one of the few very best games i have ever played. To write about all ~100 hours + that i have played through till finishing the story would need more then 1 page, so i try to be short as possible.Probably never before i was captivated by open world then in this game. It is huge. And i mean HUGE! There a tons of activities, and every one of them is interesting, it keeps you going further, explore and etc. Gameplay is outstanding. Fights are incredibly done, they are brutal, so as this world. Graphics are amazing. Music! What a score and especially during battles - great stuff. Voice acting was superb by all involved. Just to thing how much effort was put into creating every single thing and detail in this game is mind blowing. To be honest i wasn't a fan of "Witcher II", haven't even played the first one. But after finishing "Wild Hunt" i can safely say - count me in for (hopefuly) next installments. This is simply one of the very best games ever created.Overall, "The Witcher III: Wild Hunt" is a masterpiece. I do not use this word usually, but in this case it is the one that perfectly summarize this experience. Own this game no matter what genres do you prefer - this is a perfect game for everyone. Masterpiece.;10/10;16 February 2016;86 out of 99 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;The Wild Hunt is a Wild Ride, In a Wild, Cruel World;"How do you like that silver?" - Geralt of RiviaI, for one, like that silver. If I were a monster about to be slain, I would at least like it to be Geralt to slay me, and to hear those words... (Okay, that sounded better in my head).Anyone, this is a gorgeous and lively game, saying the least. And it is a grower. I initially thought that this game was good, but somewhat boring. It just didn't click, I felt it overrated, and I ended up leaving it for a while due to loss of interest. But I came back to it, and it is one of the best decisions I've made. My increased liking didn't come immediately, but over time, this game has worked its way up to earning a 10/10 from me, to becoming my favorite open world game, to becoming my favorite video game, period. It is definitely a game you'll have to get used to first, especially if you have never played any other Witcher game. But if you give it time, you may realize what a piece of art and amazing achievement this is.As mentioned before, this game is gorgeous. Sure, its graphics aren't the most realistic when compared to other games, but it still looks so believable and so detailed. And once the fantasy elements kick in, it is some of the best imagination put into a video game. There are numerous kinds of creatures apart from humans, both docile and hostile. The open world itself is huge and has tons of various places to explore, from plains, to mountains, to actual kingdoms and villages. Each of those places looks inspired by some civilization in history, with its own spin, of course. And the variety between experiencing friendly and unfriendly societies throughout the journey is quite noticeable. Speaking of which, the main journey is 40-50 hours, with the entire game giving nearly 200 hours. Now that is an adventure, and not in the way where there will be actual grinding. There actually is A LOT of content, pretty well-varied.The story is among the most epic and well-written I have ever experienced. As a die-hard Uncharted fan, I struggled to find as much enjoyment in other single-player stories as Uncharted. But I started to find those in Batman: Arkham, Infamous, and of course, this game. The characters are among the best I have seen, and I deeply cared for each one. That doesn't happen often. Each character is different and likeable in their own ways, and almost anyone you meet is also a badass in combat, whether they're a sorcerer/sorceress, warrior, or even a witcher like you.The quests themselves are also great, obviously. I was so sad to see the main quest come to an end when I beat it. Even though I got the happiest ending out of all the possible endings (same with the DLCs), I felt empty. That's how great it was. It often changes between tense dialogue, intense action, humor, mystery, and laid-back downtime with those Geralt area as family. Hardly did any of it feel repetitive. And the side quests themselves are a fun ride. Instead of being shallow side activities, those quests have their own stories too, and there is a wide range of that. Some can be simple and trivial, while others involve eliminating a group of bandits or a dangerous monster. If you want to be guaranteed to hunt down and kill a monster, look no further than witcher contracts, which are sure to give you generous rewards afterwards, in addition.And of course, the gameplay itself is super fun. I feel the combat system fluid, and it is a unique type, mixing magic and swordplay. That already sounds like Dark Souls, but I doubt it is the same (haven't play Dark Souls, so I don't know). But it is unique nonetheless. Upon exploring the vast world, you have a horse to travel with, and activities other than quests include clearing out bandit camps, saving people in distress, finding hidden treasure, competing in horse races, and more. There is much to do and so much to find. And the bosses are epic as well. The may not be the most challenging, but some certainly are a challenge.I could go on and on about why I got so hooked with this game. There is so much to say about it, and I couldn't think of any flaws, besides the long loading times. The amount of work CDPR put into this just feels like they spoil us gamers, especially with the two DLC packs feeling like full games on their own. This is my first single-player game where I passed the 100-hour mark and I still feel like I have much to do. Again, I'm so glad I allowed myself the opportunity to give this game a second chance, because I would have really misses out. Given that, I pity anyone who hasn't played this yet. It is not just a game, but an immersive experience, a really good one at that.;10/10;21 May 2019;31 out of 34 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Brilliant...Simply brilliant! ,,Return of The King" of video game history;Ever since the Lord of The Rings trilogy, I've said to myself that I will never see anything so epic that will be remembered for generations to come. It's a rare thing these days that something can leave such a strong impression on it's fans and usually shape their emotions from time to time. Fortunately, I was wrong. Witcher 3 is a not only a great video game when it comes to story and gameplay, it simply stands as it's own type of masterpiece which words cannot describe how good it is. With the first Witcher being a solid start for the franchise to introduce the newcomers to the witcher universe and Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings being a great sequel which fixed the mistakes of the first game and adding more debt to the story and plot progression, Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt is an epic conclusion to an epic saga (much like Return of The King) which started out from a lesser known book series in Poland to a mainstream video game franchise known by many fans worldwide. Just like the previous games, you are the Butcher of Blaviken, the White Wolf, the Witcher and none other than Geralt of Rivia. You start your journey as you and Vesemir search the White Orchard looking for Yennefer, asking around the townsfolk, while the war between Nilfgaard and Redania wages on. You get a contract by the Nilfgaardians to find and kill a Royal Griffin in order to get informations about Yennefer's whereabouts. Once you complete the task you will encounter the Bandits of Velen who work under the leadership of the Bloody Baron Philip Strenger, thus deciding whether to fight them or stay calm during their offensive babble. After you've finished your time with the Baron's henchmen, the Nilfgaardians will await you under the guidance of Yennefer, who had heard of a Witcher who came to White Orchard. In the meantime, you will be escorted to Vizima while being pursued by the Wild Hunt's Red Riders. Once you arrive, you will learn from Emhyr Var Emreis that his daughter Cirilla has returned, and that she is being chased by the Wild Hunt. It is up to you to search the leads of Velen, Novigrad and eventually Skellige to find Ciri and save her from the wretched Wraiths/Elves of Aen Seidhe, while ecountering other interesting quests along the road, taking you to a much highter level as you progress. This is enough informations you need to be aware of what's going on, so I'll be generous not to spoil some parts of story and spit it all out, because it's up to you to begin the adventure and tell it your own way as you make decisions throughout the game. The best thing about this game, is that it never fails to amaze and keep you motivated as you progress, learning plenty of things along the way, and maybe playing a round of Gwent to take a break from ,,Killing monsters"... I'm glad that Geralt of Rivia has survived many difficult situations and managed to come out alive in the end, and I am proud of CD Projekt Red for finally putting his fighting days to rest and ended his story on a high note. I hope this review has helped a bit and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.;10/10;30 April 2018;30 out of 33 found this helpful.

CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;Massively overrated!!!;So I bought this game expecting to play something truly transcendent. After all, this game has a better rating than Skyrim (which I hold as the golden standard for most video games and all action fantasy). I was sorely disappointed. The things that irked me the most were there graphics, fluidity of gameplay, lack of consistency, useless elements and lack of free world roaming. For graphics, to put it short and sweet, Skyrim destroys this game. Never once was did I go "wow". It was just meh. For fluidity of gameplay, there was multiple times through gameplay when I got stuck, primarily with the water elements. For example, how is it that your character cannot jump out of two feet of water? Geralt can do parkour but can't get out of a mud puddle. For lack of consistency I bring up the crossbow. Somehow in water it can kill enemies in one or two hits but out of water it's the equivalent of a Nerf gun. WTF. For useless elements, gwent. It's basically a massive waste of time that isn't even really that fun. The only reason to play is to get accomplishment trophies. Lastly is the lack of free world to roamability. In Skyrim, I used to just love walking around and seeing what random cave or fort or bandit camp I could come across. In Witcher, it's considered "open world" but it's about as open as a closet in an underground bunker. Overall not a bad game, but DEFINITELY not worth the praise it gets over much more deserving games.;6/10;29 August 2018;24 out of 159 found this helpful.

This has to be one of the best open world game I or anyone has played. And the combat is just so satisfying you can't get enough of it.... The story took me about 60 hours to beat but it was worth it. The game has 3 main endings which vary depending on what choices you make during your playthrough. This game is like Game Of Thrones of video games...;10/10;29 June 2019;17 out of 19 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;One of the best games in history;It does not matter, if you enjoy mostly RPGs or not, it does not matter where you are from, it does not matter whether you have read the books or not. This game will surely grasp you and make you love it from the start ! The story itself is the key to giving this title a 10/10. The best films, the best anecdotes and the best PC games all have something in common - the STORY has to be one of high-quality and has to sound believable /even if it might be in fanstasy setting.../ This game will tell you a story that is very very emotional and emersive, to some exent funny, to some extent sad, to some extent truly grand. And those graphics - this is one more reason to play the WITCHER 3. It is simply too amazing not to see it ! The beauty and the variety of lands, buildings, faces and moves surely is more than enough. One more thing - the minor characters are smart and never out of place. Sometimes, minor NPCs build the foundations of a game, and this time it happens with a finesse that is rarely seen. The ending is the other great Yesman if you are sitting on a table and asking yourself "Hmmmm, should I play this?". The ending is not what one might expect ... So be ready to be amazed ! Not to mention, the skill tree of the main character is pretty cool, too. The only negative feeling I had while playing this RPG was that some side quests were not so interesting and that there was too much rolling in fighting stronger enemies.;10/10;17 March 2018;15 out of 17 found this helpful.

CD Projekt RED;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;RPG at its Best;On 19th May 2015, the third installment of "The Witcher" series was launched. I downloaded the same on 20th May 2015 and started playing. I have also completed "The Witcher 2 Assassin's of Kings" as well so keeping in mind the past experience I really enjoyed playing the new game. Geralt of Rivia, also known as white wolf along with Triss and Yen was a beautiful story line with scenic picturesque, excellent melody and intense fight scenes and I loved the game very much. It took me 8 days 6 hours 4 minutes 27 seconds to complete the game in all. So a total of 198 hours game play which is a lot to reach level 34. I have completed 220 quests out of which 14 quests were partly failed and one quest which was completed earlier was a failed quest after that specific quest was complete it was Cave of Dreams. Seven quests of Gwent game and five quests of horse races were not completed by me so in total there were 232 all quest including main, side and treasure hunts. I have downloaded the games original soundtrack and the music is fantastic. I love the game very much.;10/10;18 June 2015;43 out of 56 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;An honest review from someone who absolutely loved Witcher 3;... expected a similar experience. I promised I would alter this review once I have played through, and I have a few things to add. I won't spoil any particular story moments if you still want to read it, but I'll tell you why I'm not happy with the way it ends. First of all, I'm usually a completionist (Ghost of Tsushima, Witcher 3, God of War) but I finished the game here after roughly 48 hours. With some side gigs done (not very interesting but gives eddies), all side quests and all main quests. This is, honestly, very short for an open world RPG. I heard it from someone else before, that it's short, but I didn't believe it until I played it. I personally can't fathom how another youtuber accumulated 120 hrs, because I personally have no interest in clearing out the map - it's just not interesting enough past the side and main quests.PROS: The main story is witten really well, very interesting - and I'm basically playing the game for itMost of the characters and their backgrounds are enticing (Jackie, Delamain, Johnny Silverhand, Evelyn Parker, Alt, Rogue, Kerry).A couple of great protagonists disappear early on! The graphics are great on a top-end PC (with a 3070 and Ryzen 3900X).The music and soundtrack is top notch, outright amazing.CONS: Zombie NPCs / AI and idiotic trafficSo much less "impactful" and "quirky" side quests in comparison to Witcher 3. It also really needs some lightheartedness.The world feels just grim. And bland, and empty. I expected there to be more dazzling, over-the-top parts of the city (eg insane holograms) and buildings that are stunning, and more distinction between the districts. But everything looks very similar, it could just be another American city like Las Vegas.I expected to run into interesting stories randomly while exploring the map, but I haven't yet.V is overall a less likeable/iconic character than Geralt. Even if you come from corpo, you still end up with a weird "V street slang" as if V was meant to just be a streetkid - they should have just stuck to a more neutral way of talking.Customisation: is basically non existent. There is way too little unique clothing, and you can't mod your character visually. Even though "style" was part of CDPR's advertisement.You also rarely get to see your character in cutscenes - except when you take a screenshot which is a bit of a shameRomance: The options are a bit underwhelming, especially River Wards questline. He fell a bit short in comparison to the other two main ones and it was a bit rushed. I would have also expected more significant options, aside from River/Panam/Judy.A few too many bugs, considering how much time they had to polish. Which suggests to me they were massively behind in development schedule all along.I don't feel the urge to 100% complete this game or replay it anytime soonTHE ENDING leaves much to be desired. Why? Because a lot of our questions aren't getting answered, no matter which ending you'll get.CDPR decided to take you back to where you started before the last mission after you finished the main story, a design choice I absolutely despise. Ghost of Tsushima did this better. heck even the Witcher 3 which was made by CDPR (even though it doesn't feel like it at times). I also can't see how they connect here in future DLCS, because the endings you can achieve for V differ greatly. THE STORY overall feels very linear. Yes, you can impact your ending and get different ones. But overall my choices or the way I played V, along with the path I came from at the start, don't really seem to matter much.CONCLUSION:CDPR is a company that can produce great games, and we all know it. People also seem to forget that this is only their second big AAA game, after the Witcher 3. They are not rockstar (yet). With Cyberpunk, I feel like they shot themselves in the foot announcing release dates that just weren't doable. They hyped up the game too much, and invested an insane amount of money and time into marketing - when they should have laid low and told us "we release it's when it's ready, 2021". This is entirely, and I mean entirely, on the management and leadership (CEO) of CDPR. I assume it was just greed for money, nothing more or less. The devs had worked hard and deserved better, like us gamers.Don't get me wrong. Cyberpunk is a good, enjoyable game, but nothing extraordinary like The Witcher 3. It basically plays like it wasn't ready to be released, and a lot of things were rushed. It almost feels like it got released a year too early. They promised us content that just isn't in the game, and I expected much more open world RPG.I think they should scratch the whole multiplayer plans, and polish it, and give us banging DLCs like in the Witcher. Where Heart of Stone and Blood and Wine were better than the main game.And the biggest thing is: Learn from this release. Improve. Re-structure your company. Give us games in the future like Witcher 3, God of War, and Red Dead Redemption. We'll get over it.;7/10;13 December 2020;85 out of 110 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Cyberpunk 2077: Masterful storytelling hold down by its flaws;TLDR: 83/100 (probably going up after patches similarly to The Witcher 3)Preface:Cyberpunk 2077 was among the most highly anticipated games in history. Its brought to us by the same developers of the Witcher games which, in addition to the casting of Keanu "Breathtaking" Reeves, is probably what made this game as hyped as it was. With all this hype this game was destined to be a failure for some, for me however it was probably the best gaming experience I have had all year. Despite the amazing writing it is just average in some of its "RPG" parts, this did not hinder my enjoyment much, but it might lower yours significantly.Story and Characters:Main Story:Cyberpunk's Main story (around 25 hours) is relatively short, especially when looking at the Witcher 3 with its around 50 hours. The biggest weak point of the story is the first act. It mostly just serves as setup for the main story and introduction to the world, this is also where your chosen live path only ever plays a major role, which is somewhat disappointing. After this pretty generic 3-4 hour long introduction the story jumps to its high point and stays there for its entire run, it's an incredible story where you as V get to decide how it plays out. Once starting the second act you will stay at the edge of your seat throughout the entire journey. The ending is an emotional banger, and it does not really matter what ending you get, V's fate is always a punch in the gut, always fitting with the classic themes of the Cyberpunk Genre and the World of Night City. Another detail i find fascinating is that the name of every quest is the name of a song and said song matches the tone of the quest pretty well. Chopin for the final was such a fitting choice.Side Stories:The side quests are where Cyberpunk truly manages to outdo most games I have played prior. If you read this right now and have yet to play/finish this game, go play through the side missions even if they seem meaningless at first most develop into mind-boggling stories that show what kind of bleak future for the human race is prophesied here. The side quests always end with though moral choices, they also further the understanding of Night City and how AI "lives" in it (Delemain quest line or "Coin Operated Boy") to a disturbing look at Night City's politics in "Dream on". Not to even mention the more personal quest that are equally as amazing, especially the four main ones with one romance option in each (depending on the gender of your charatcer).Those often surprising developments lead me to always do every side quest. You never know if the basic "kill x" side quest you just started develops into the best quest of the game. There is also some foreshadowing in some side quests, adding greatly to the replayability of the game.The Side quests also majorly influence the endings you can achieve, doing some side quests will open up 5 more possible endings. You are free to rush, only playing the main story, but also can experience the game in its entirety and get something totally different as a ending.Characters:The Characters are the heart of the game. The story is great and raises interesting points regarding AI, our possible future and body modification, but the characters in this grim world are what makes the ending so emotional especially with what happens while the credits roll.However, V, is the in my opinion worst written one. The 3 live paths did introduce you to him but never really gave huge insights to any bits of his past. Every other character is believable, and you get to know them greatly, from goals, past to personal struggles you get to know everything about the people living in and around Night City.The Characters of Cyberpunk 2077 are more than you might expect at first glance, the most prominent example here is clearly the man, the myth, the legend Johnny Silverhand. He is also the character most prominent throughout the story and the one that undergoes the most surprising but amazing development. The others are not much different though, they all are so well fleshed out and developed that once that ending hits, it really it's hard.Gameplay and SoundCombat with balancing issues Its all up to you how to approach a mission, you can just run and gun, hack the enemy into killing himself or bring out your blades from inside your arms. Across the board everything here is pretty average and not groundbreaking in any way, the game is clearly not about the combat and more about the story, the amount of variety however does make up for it. A huge problem for the combat is that the different aspects are not that well-balanced in my opinion. Melee and Hacking/Stealth feels way too strong. Another problem is that missions turn from hard to very easy in no time at all and even turning the difficulty to the highest level does not make them more challenging.Leveling up:They handled the role-playing features very well in my opinion. There are attributes and perks. Attributes are here more major while perks are more specific. The Attribute points are sparse, and you can't get all maxed out. That further increases the replay value since you can't get your Attribute points back. Always trying different builds will be one of the main reasons to replay this game.Sound:The pretty average gunplay gets compensated here. The Gun sounds are what makes the combat fun pair that with the banger that is this games soundtrack, and you will have fun just shooting up some cyberpsychos. The Voice acting is also top-notch.The AI Its just bad. Nothing more to say, it surely is a downgrade from games that came out a couple of years ago.The World: Night CityOpen World: Atmospheric but not the next GTA CDPR's worlds were always about stories and not about you interacting a lot with it. What you experience in this game you experience in the quests, not in any side activities. There is not much interaction with the world. Its mostly a stage for the characters to play on. You have an apartment, but it does not feel like "home" because you just can't do anything with it. Just don't go in it expecting it to be a Rockstar game, because it is not. However, the atmosphere in Night City is amazing, driving through the rain as never been better in any game i have ever played. Its also very detailed, you know by looking around in which district you are, what people live here and how they live.Visuals Its stunningly beautiful. My old GPU really surprised me with how good games can still look with it. The Photo mode also is a great addition to really capture the beauty of Night City. Its not well optimized though, it does run relatively smooth but dips below 40 fps at times. Even on moderate settings.Technical ProblemsIt seems the ones i had were relatively mild but still decreasing the enjoyment to some little extend.Especially when i had to reload just because i got stuck with a quest which happened at least 3-4 times. Technically speaking its clearly a mess but the same was Witcher 3 and look how that turned out!Wrapping it up Despite all the flaws that this game indeed has. The miserable AI, the lack of interaction with the world (even The Witcher 3 had Gwent) and the balancing issues, just to name the biggest ones. It has Groundbreaking characters, themes and stories to carry the game. Pair that with the beautiful world that is Night City you get a Breathtaking game that is worth every penny i paid for it.The games foundation is superb, it just needs some more work and neat extra features and its a contender for my personal top games of all time.;8/10;26 December 2020;34 out of 43 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Great game except for one little thing;I'm aware that I'm playing it on the Xbox One and my processing power is not up to where it should be for that seamless experience. This game is meant for Next Gen consoles, which is a struggle since not everyone can afford or even get a new system with them selling out like crazy. Gameplay wise the exploration and depth is fantastic and the blurriness of an Xbox One vs the new systems, is distracting but not a deal breaker. What is frustrating is how many times I've crashed and have had to redo missions but that also gives a fun change to approach the same mission in a new way. It's a complete, polished, and super detailed game but I wish it would run better on Xbox One and PS4.;9/10;10 December 2020;61 out of 103 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;A great game with a terrible release.;Cyberpunk had one of the worst releases of all time. It had so much bugs and glitches that it was barely playable. But after a while majority of it was all fixed and that was when I got it. And after playing thought the game it's not that bad it's has a compelling story with some Beautiful graphics the open world feels alive and the combat is not that bad you basically become an unstoppable killing machine by the end of the game. Keanu Reeves was one of the best parts of the game he is with you all though out the story. The game also has it's own choice wheel where you pick what your character says and the choices you pick will affect the story as a hole. The game has about 6 different endings so there is always a reason to replay the game. There is tons of additional content to do after the game with tons of side quests and collectables to find. The game also lets you select your origin story and that will make different characters react to you differently and you can only meet certain characters depending on your origin story. Overall the game is not bad it just had a bad release I would recommend to play it now as the game is not that bad anymore.;10/10;13 August 2022;33 out of 38 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;REDEMPTION;For me, this game has completely redeemed itself.From playing it at launch I was thoroughly disappointed. With all the glitches and bugs I just kept forcing myself to enjoy it, but I've given it another go on Xbox Series S and it is like a brand new game. I feel like this is what the game was supposed to be like when it first got released. The graphics are smooth, no bugs/glitches. you get the odd visual glitch where something won't render in but for me that is very rare. I'm loving this game at the moment and I'm starting a brand new save for the third time now. Give this game the hype it deserves.;10/10;27 December 2021;24 out of 29 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Masterpiece;This game is not just a game to me. The world feels alive and so does every character in the story and side stories. Truly alive and fantastic. I've played countless games in my life but this experience changed my life. I changed my life path in real life due to this game. I know it's just a stupid video game how can it be so amazing?! Yeah I have no idea. I can't put it into words but this is such an immersive and mature game. It is funny and emotional and real, raw and deep. I love being in the world of this game. I love replaying this game which I never do usually. This game makes me feel things and that is quite an accomplishment trust me :). Every inch of this game and its world is interesting to me and playing through the story doesn't feel like you're doing missions like in most games but it feels like a natural progression and unfolding of a complex and unprecedentely deep narrative. There is also such an incredible feeling of evolution in the story. once you think you know what the stakes and direction are going to be the game throws something completely unexpected at you which changes your adventure and investment in this new adventure. In short: this is my favorite game out of all of the games I've ever played.;10/10;28 September 2023;9 out of 11 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Excellent;This game is.... well, AMAZING. The wait was worth it, even though it did kinda suck... We have great graphics with an overall great story (and Keanu Reeves which is just another plus). Thus far I have no complaints.;10/10;10 December 2020;63 out of 112 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Changed my mind :) After negative review;Uh, man do I need to take back my words. After writing negative review a took time to play through again and noticed what made me loose track of the game story. After secind play I've noticed you need to follow certain "rules". For example - if you want one route you need to finish specific quests and stick with a certain path. If you jump from mission to mission things can become unlogical and detached in terms of story. Game is good, much much better than I first thought. No matter the ending (except the pistol one), all endings are interesting. You just stick with one storyline, don't jump here and there, and it will make sense. The game is both straight forward or chaotic since everything is there for you to play but if you for example stick with Panams track or Rouge, you get logical storyline.;10/10;6 November 2022;12 out of 17 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;I wish they delayed it further back;CyberPunk 2077 is one of the most immersive games I've played in the past year, it is also the buggiest game I've played in a long time. The game doesn't feel finished, it has pop in issues, cars blowing up for no reason, I can't see my own guns half the time, I've seen more trees in the game than I have in real life, that is exaggerated but I can see trees across the world from me as they exist on this plane of sight that is jaw dropping in it's stupidity and also in my 25 hours of gameplay I've experienced 5 crashes. I'm amazed as to how a game can be in development for so long and turn out this way and I can't recommend it at the current $60 asking price for PC. I can't imagine what it's like on console. I would pass until they've fixed the bugs and issues that are in the game.;6/10;13 December 2020;50 out of 65 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;A savage reception that needs a fairer perspective - credit where it's due;Its a crying shame that the release of this game was faced with so many bugs, problems, issues and mess ups that detract from the sheer brilliance of this game. I've been blown away by Cyberpunk 2077. I was fortunate not to experience many of the issues that other users have had, only minor, comical on occasion, mishaps, but despite this I was enthralled by its virtues throughout. I didn't get too bogged damn in the usually monogamy of the filler content standard in games such as this, delving instead into the storyline and was hooked immediately. Got to say, this was written like nothing I've seen on TV, games or many of the movies that get so much hype today - exceeding them all, truly masterful. Acting by the cast is spot on. I'm not exaggerating at all, the story, characters and script of the main story line (and associated side quests) are phenomenal. What a reward to see the less bleak storyline finales play out because the bad, twisted and quite frankly horrifying epilogues chilled me to the bone. I'm gutted that the developers (and co) were pushed for completion so recklessly, resulting in commitments that didn't allow for the end user experience promised. Gutted mainly because the subsequent reception generally ignore or detract from the amazing wonders Cyberpunk has achieved. I was fortunate. my experience was epic. The gameplay, sound, the pace superb, the depth of character development, the investment of the numerous people that cohabitate the rich world of night city really left me moved and satisfied with the experience. The things they did get right are incredible. I spent hours marvelling at the intricacy and sheer ambition of the cityscape, the raunchy ads that give a disturbing possibility of the status quo to come, the dystopian savagery of one very possible future the next generation may experience. I'm blown away by this title. What an experience. I truly hope all the hardship the development team has faced eases and is replaced with the respect and credit they deserve.;8/10;27 January 2021;9 out of 12 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Excellent story/characters/quests, flawed sandbox;I'd put the Witcher 3 up there with my top ten games of all times, a serious contender for the best written RPG I've ever played, competing against Planescape: Torment and Knights of the Old Republic 2.After the triumph of Wild Hunt, the hype for this new release of CD Projekt RED was insane, which is leading to strongly mixed reactions. Eight MILLION preorders is an incredible result. however, a certain part of the fandom seems to be receiving this as well as the last season of Game of Thrones, churning out scornful memes at impressive speed.I've read console versions have important issues in terms of visuals and stability. On my PC no complaints on the matter, the game looks neat and I've encountered no major bugs.More than a cyberpunk Witcher 3, however, this feels like Deus Ex: Night City.Writing is typically fine, both in the main and secondary quests, with memorable characters and solid dialogues anchored by strong voice acting. CD Projekt RED has a knack for creating NPCs far more interesting than the usual quest-delivering puppets.What doesn't work? Well, the open world sandbox element of the game lacks immersion and feels rushed compared to, say, Red Dead Redemption 2, which came out two years ago. Night City is vast and looks impressive (I particularly like its verticality) but kinda feels empty, because NPC (and vehicle) AI is lacking and, well, there's not a lot to do other than quests. Some features reek of cutting corners, like the awful police AI: when a crime is committed a bunch of angry cops will spawn behind you like law-enforcing, trigger-happy ghosts and start shooting. It's so rough compared to the sophisticated reactions of lawmen in RDR2.My advice: if you liked, say, Deus Ex: Human Revolution and want to play this on PC for the story and characters, Cyberpunk is strongly recommended. If you crave an immersive sandbox cyberpunk experience ("GTA 2077: Blade Runner"), wait for new patches and see.;7/10;13 December 2020;24 out of 38 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;A technical Disaster on Consoles;Playing it on PS4, i decided to buy it for PS4 because i was hyped like never before, but i have should waited for PS5, it's unplayable, it feels and looks like a 10 year old game... i will wait for the free Upgrade to play it... P.s.: sorry for my english, i'm not a native speaker, but wanted to write it in english to reach more people.;1/10;10 December 2020;103 out of 172 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Better than I expected and hoped;Just imagine, waiting for the game to come out for eight years, and when it does it exceeds all your expectations. There was an indescribable feeling when I just turned it on. Honestly, I actually cried. This is exactly what I wanted to see. Incredible graphics, vast opportunities for the customization of your character, global detailing of the smallest and seemingly unnecessary objects, comprehensible gameplay and of course THE DIALOGUES and their INFLUENCE ON THE GAMEPLAY. At moments moments like this, you understand that you have not waited for this game for so long in vain. There have not been such a number of innovations in a single game for a very long time. This is the new generation Half-life. New engine, awesome visuals, brilliant plot. On the downside of things the game is still pretty raw, since it just came out. But, I believe, gradually, the developers will fix everything, so you shouldn't worry about that too much.;10/10;10 December 2020;57 out of 105 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Loved it!;I played this game on release after waiting through its many delays and was happy with how it turned out. For my first time going through the game I chose the Corpo life path which was very enjoyable. My main complaints about the game are the dialogue: each character talks a lot about fictional technology which can really make conversations feel long and boring, the combat: it isn't bad, it's just mediocre, the range of weapons is great the ways you can use them is as well, the hand to hand combat is dreadful(probably the worst in any game ever but it can be avoided), the bugs: now, this is everyone's biggest complaint but personally I haven't seen any game breaking bugs yet and I have played through the whole game, I have only had some minor bugs that I can laugh off. Right, the good parts of the game is definitely the story. I adore the story, it's so interesting and the fact that it can change for people is incredible, it makes the game very replay able and my ending was so satisfying. The start of the game is also great and gave and great feel for it. The middle part was alright, there was some speed bumps which can be expected when squeezing in a lot of information in a limited time. The characters are also amazing. I've heard some people say that Keanu Reeves character, Johnny Silverhand, was dry, but I loved the chemistry between him and V. The other smaller characters where great as well, especially Jackie. If the game was released without any glitches it could have been one of the many greats! 8/10 get past the frame rate and bugs and simply play for the story and characters.;8/10;29 December 2020;10 out of 15 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;A real work of art.;This review is odd. I can honestly say this game is still broken in some ways. But story wise this might just be 10/10. I played it when it was releaced, from start to finish (including 99% of extra. The game in the beginning was not that bad. People where abit to harsh. This game is huge. Every thing looking hella good. Already on release I would have gave it a 10/10. So now (if anyone is reading this)... I just played thro the entire game again. Diffrent character also a female (was a dude last time). The thing with this story, its so amazing that you make your "own" choices and the choices change the game and how it feels. Alltho you can say its all scripted, yeah ofc it is. But it does not feel like it when you play. The beginning of the game is kinda odd and feels abit rushed but thats only like 1% of the game. If you have not tryed this game and only heard the bad things its perhaps hard to understand but to me: This is one of the best games I have ever played, if not the best "Story based game" I have ever played.Maybe I will comeback in a few years and try it again. But from my 2 times playing the entire game (160+hours ingame). I can only say that this is one hell of a game. Story wise nothing comes close. Thx for reading my ramble. Have a nice day/evening/night choom.;10/10;12 November 2022;8 out of 12 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;I will stick by this games side until the day I die;Let's get one thing straight, yes this game has bugs and glitches. But that's what updates are for, to fix things. Do you think CDPR wanted to make a game full of bugs? I mean look at Fallout: New Vagas, Skyrim, and hell even the first Red Dead Redemption has many bugs. The people who worked on this took 8 years out of their live to give you entertainment they put their heart and soul into it. They didn't take the short cut like Anthem or Mass Effect: Andromeda. Give this game a chance. If you look past the bugs you'll get an incredible game with an amazing story, stunning graphics, great characters, fun combat, and a blood pumping sound track to listen as you drive in night city. The game isn't in the best place right now. But CDPR will fix it. It even might pull a "No Mans Sky." I don't care if I'm the only person to say this: I love this game.;10/10;27 July 2021;9 out of 14 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;Cyberpunk 2077 Could Have Been Something Special But Its Still Pretty Good Despite the Bugs;The potential Cyberpunk 2077 had was amazing. Between the marketing material, how amazing the world looked and the hype somehow reaching another level, I pre-ordered and even bought the strategy guide. If you've been following the game, you know how things went upon launch. It was a complete horror show between the backlash from the community and all the memes and videos with some truly mind boggling glitches. CD Projekt Red's stock tanked and the game earned some special company with the infamy it created (Cyberpunk 2076 anyone?). Is it still worth picking up despite all the issues? I would say yes but with a few caveats that I will list below.Are the glitches and performance as bad as you've heard? Yes... Unfortunately they are. I was beyond excited and despite reports of the game being a buggy mess... it only delayed me playing it for a few weeks. I still was tempted enough to fire it up. It crashed on me several times and key components like environments and certain characters took minutes to render instead of being ready instantaneously. I got caught in buildings that were broken enough to let me in but the doors wouldn't open to let me out and I fell out of the map a few times. The phone segments and the driving were the worst. But as much as I could continue to just list flaw after flaw, I did just get used to it and accept it. The game is good enough to overcome and after a trial by fire period, it became an almost non-issue. It was worth it in the end but I can't blame people for being upset or returning the game.I want to get the negatives out of the way so I'll just touch on how the gameplay was overhyped. 2077 was touted as the revolution in open world RPG gaming, as the true game changer and it didn't have nearly as many features as it was advertised to have. It does have excellent elements in it but between building up your character, the missions or how interactive the world was, I had seen most of it before. With the futuristic environment, it was in some pretty packaging but most parts were familiar instead of awe inducing. It was still entertaining but it wasn't something that re-invented wheel for a sandbox mercenary game.Getting to what I did enjoy about the game, Cyberpunk does have an involving story to tell. You get to pick V's origin story (another game element that didn't matter much in the end) but his journey through his ups and downs in Night City has a lot of fun, a ton of action and some surprisingly emotional moments. While it does start with the big heist gone bad (a familiar plot beat if you've played one of these types of games before) but between his relationship with Johnny Silverhand (a fun but vocally stunted performance by Keanu Reeves) and joining up with characters like Panam, Judy, Takemura and River, there's lots to explore and enjoy with their missions and their interplay. The game has a colourful cast of characters and while the main campaign is surprisingly short, with the side missions, gigs and cyberpsycho attacks, there's more than enough content to keep you busy in Night City.The characters actually develop and change with the beats of the story, V's love/hate relationship with Johnny and their dynamic might have been the most unique element of the game. How you can affect the game's story also had an impact. It was cool to be able to take different directions, talk my way out of conflict and pick how to deal with potential friends and enemies throughout the game. While some games champion choice as part of their narrative, Cyberpunk does back up that claim. You can fail missions and the story will keep going, save a life here that can benefit you later or sneak in and out of a compound without having to touch a weapon. You can play it your way and while that's not a entirely fresh idea, it is executed well here.For all the graphical and rendering issues, this world still is beautiful when the game functions properly. Going from district to district, each part of the city is fun to interact with and has fun stylistic shifts. There's a huge disparity in Night City of who lives and works in each area, you can go from the City Center to the Badlands and the environment is completely different. You also have some cool designs from some of the gangs, the maelstrom gang being flunkies who go beyond normal cyber modification to the animals who reject the same modification and become steroid toting hulk knockoffs. There's a lot of variety in the game and you can tell there was a ton of hours put into re-imagining our world in this neon dystopia lens.Despite all the hate and the problems, Cyberpunk is still a game worth spending your time on. The story, characters and the world are worth the investment even if the game was released too early and needed to be cleaned up. I don't blame fans for being outraged, not everyone can afford a top shelf PC or a next gen console (which at this point in time is not readily available either, so if the game is primarily sold on the older systems, its reasonable for people to expect it to work). While games are rarely glitch free these days, these types of bugs are pretty hard to explain away. Give it a shot with some lowered expectations, maybe wait until they've released some of the patches to improve your experience and hopefully you can get it at a lower price point. Unless you've got some impressive gaming hardware, in that case go nuts.;8/10;14 January 2021;9 out of 14 found this helpful.
CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;A game that could've been huge.;Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that was obviously conjured up to be a huge platinum, AAA hit and that, for not totally clear reasons, it fell very short of achieving that.The best way I could describe it would be this: imagine that the game was very well thought-out, a lot of resources and creativity put into it to make sure good ideas were concepted and developed, a very solid base laid out in terms of the overarching structure and design of the whole product but that, at some point, the budget was pulled from the game and developers ordered to wrap it up for deployment in the cheapest, quickest way possible with whatever resources they had at the time.The whole game and most individual aspects of it feel wide but not deep. Everything about Cyberpunk 2077 feels fine but very few things feel fully realized.Let's take Night City, the actual place the story takes place in, as an example. When you are in the outskirts of town and you look at the city from afar, it looks majestic. When you get close to that cityscape and look the faces of those very same buildings from a close distance, things start to feel off. When you are down on street level and look up towards the tall skyscrapers all the way from below, it looks amazing but when you actually want to climb or interact with those skyscrapers, you're denied of that. At first glance, everything is nicely-modeled, detailed, realistic, intriguing and inviting but on closer inspection, disappointment takes the wheel. Even the initial quests and introductory areas really conjure up the notion that you're in a vast, unexplored world that's alive and that has a ton of things to see and experiences to enjoy. A few minutes later, however, when you actually walk down the streets of the town and are left to free roam, everything feels incredibly generic and empty. In the first firefight, the level layout is engaging, there are many tactics to approach it and there's a sense of imminent danger. When bullets start flying, you can shoot pieces of plaster and concrete off the walls really allowing you to appreciate a sophisticated and promising physics systems that would make any battle much more interesting and satisfying. Yet all of these promises get diluted very quickly and the rest of the game has nothing to do with the initial impressions.It's hard to put a finger on what exactly creates this disappointing vibe. Whatever the cause, I take a look at the game world and it's very clear that this was set up to be a huge game with a lot of content and high quality subsystems but for some reason this vision was left unrealized. All pedestrians do one thing: walk in a straight line, 90% of the buildings you can't go into, as if they were made of cardboard, highways and avenues are, at times, populated with only one or two cars and so on and so forth.This phenomenon also trickles down to the actual missions and gameplay content. Most side-missions are just 'steal that', 'hack this computer', 'kill this NPC' and they become stale, repetitive, very easily. Also, they have pretty much no impact on anything tangible other than the self-contained experience of completing that mission. Dialogues? More of the same: most conversation choices are absolutely irrelevant and seemingly penned in as an after-thought to create some illusion of player interaction and choice. Even on missions where you are required to do things stealthily, if you don't, the only consequence is the quest-giver saying "hey, you're a disappointment" but rewarding you (albeit with a bit less money) for finishing the mission and calling it complete regardless.Character development? Same deal-o. Yes, there was clearly some thought put into romance routes with different characters but all those scenarios feel like sketches of what they were meant to be. You can romance a character, have sex with them and all but confess your love for them and a couple hours later they are with you on the phone speaking distantly as if you had just met. Skill trees and character customization? Yup! There's like 10, 12 different skill trees and, save a few notable exceptions, they sure as hell don't feel like they mold or specialize your character into anything separate from any other character.Let me beat the proverbial dead horse for the last time: there's this quest, right? One of those staple secondary questlines in modern RPGs you are introduced to very early on in the game, a pursue-at-your-own-leisure type of deal. We all know the kind. In this particular one, you have to fight a bunch of different opponents in street fights and, eventually, reach a big bad boss. When you finally beat him, nothing really happens. Yes, you are given some money. Yes, one NPC says "hey, good job!", but that's it. Even the NPC that hands you the quest and keeps tabs on progress through it all says absolutely nothing at the culmination of it. It's so abrupt and anticlimactic that a lot of people took to Google in search for answers having the same thoughts: "the quest must have bugged out" or "there must be a glitch where the dialogue for the finishing of the quest didn't trigger". But no: it's just the way it is haphazardly implemented.There's definitely a pattern: the foundations for most aspects of the game are great and solid but something happened along the way and Cyberpunk 2077 became a rushed, unfinished, empty product instead of an honest labor of love. By the way, this company clearly knows how to make a hugely successful, beautiful game: they've done it with the The Witcher series. It's clearly not a matter of expertise or know-how. What's also clear is that the game was going to be bigger and better than what we actually got.Having said all this, I still believe you should play this game through, at least once, if nothing else, for the main story.From a technical standpoint, we all know the release for this game was awful and unplayable for some people, but as of today, in patch version 1.3 the game is playable. It still is glitchy and frustrating at times, but it's stable: just had literally two crashes in more than 60 or 70 hours of playtime and I could finish all content in the game without having to do crazy workarounds to finish missions (okay, maybe once).Incomplete as it might feel, what's present in Cyberpunk 2077 can be fun. Depending on the playstyle, the basic gameplay loop can be pretty rewarding for quite a few hours, particularly if you can jive with the main narrative from a storytelling point of view.Speaking of the story, I would venture to say that the main selling point of the whole shebang is the plot. It's interesting, it's more or less well narrated and structured and the interactions between the main cast and the world around them are, for the most part, compelling enough to leave you hungry for more. Hell, I'll say this: Keanu even had me in (very manly) tears a couple of times.Now for some hyper-specific personal recommendations that most people will hate, but hey, who's writing this review?1) Play the game in Japanese with English subs.Don't ask me why, but it works. I never do this in any game, but there's something about the general aesthetic of Cyberpunk 2077 that lends itself to this. Feels much closer to the anime Akira and Ghost in the Shell than Bladerunner and Total Recall. It just makes the whole experience feel much more natural, engaging and immersive than hearing the English voiceovers.2) If on PC, get the mod "Muted Markers".Default loot visibility is weird and annoying, since you have to constantly be spamming your scanner for item markers to pop up and, even so, it glitches out and you might miss important loot. This mod fixes this and is the #1 quality of life improvement I can think of.2b) If on PC, also get the mod "Annoy Me No More".Removes fall damage (come on, people have cyberlegs and can telepathically hack into stuff but they die if they drop from a 20-feet-high ledge?). Other very good quality-of-life fixes that you'll probably want to install are bundled in this very same mod as well.2c) If on PC, also get the mod "Holster by Tap". Whoever designed the holster/weapon cycling for the PC version was a sadist.3) Play a Netrunner.The whole playstyle revolves around hacking people and devices while remaining more or less away from the action. It starts out a little slow and it's a bit gear-dependant, but, after a while, the way you can control and dominate multiple enemies instantly and safely with quickhacks becomes pretty fun and unique to this game so it's probably something you want to experience to some extent in your playthrough.4) Play a time-stopping Samurai.Grab a katana, the Qiant Sandevistan Mk. 4 "Warp Dancer" cyberware (don't punch Fingers!) and 3 Sandevistan heatsinks. This is one of (if not *the* most) fun builds in the game. If on PC, there's an essential mod that really fixes the mechanics in this build to what it should've been by default: it's called "Better Melee". It contains not only fundamental fixes, but it there's also a module that gives Mantis Blade functionality (basically a leap-to-enemy attack) to any melee weapon, which makes katana builds super fun. Very highly recommended.4b) If on PC, get a trainer that has a 'no cooldown on skills' option.Being able to use your Sandevistan to time-stop constantly, combined with the "Better Melee" addon turns you into an anime Samurai. Freezing time, rushing a room slashing through and leaping to every enemy and thawing time to watch them all get dismembered simultaneously is oh-so-satisfying.6) Play a knife-throwing ninja.By default, the knife-throwing system is ridiculous and unusable, but if you're on PC you can get a mod called 'Enhanced Throwing Knives' that makes knife-throwing absolutely viable as a build and while the stealth shenanigans are not great in the game because of AI and the skill tree, it's still fun and a decent option if you prefer a less direct approach.;7/10;15 September 2021;9 out of 14 found this helpful.

CD Projekt RED;Cyberpunk 2077;It is playable and there is nothing completely broken, but it is also a huge buggy mess man;(REVIEWS AT LAUNCH) Honestly there isn't really a big thing that separates this game from other first person shooters. This isn't WITCHER 3, which had a huge lore and amazing world building to it. Witcher 3 has elements of other stuff but it is mostly its own thing in terms of weapons, magic, and story.Cyberpunk 2077 is basically Matrix mixed with Deus Ex, mixed with Bladerunner, mixed with Butcher Bay, and a little bit of Witcher 3's level system.The shooting is fine but I prefer Rage 2's shooting system. The one thing people will say about this game AT LAUNCH is the funny and sometimes gamebreaking glitches that happen. An example is. I plugged myself into a machine to hack it and then I froze and couldn't do anything, I've seen cars float in the air, dead bodies buried half into the cement ground, dead enemies disappearing after dying, enemies who are alive but just stand there looking at you, enemies getting their limbs stuck on a door and they begin convulsing, enemies who can disappear disappear underneath cars and get stuck there, and so much more.Oh boy, CD RED will probably fix these issues but yea, most people are right when they are talking about the problems. THIS GAME NEEDED ANOTHER 6 months - 12 months of development time. Honestly it should had never been released for PS4 & X-Box One because those are basically unplayable slideshows. This is a PC review using a GTX 2080S.The graphics are a mixed bag, the lighting, guns, and cars look good enough, but MY GOD the characters faces are a blurred mess. It seriously look like early PS3 faces. The characters tattoos are a huge ugly pixilated mess. It is unbearable to look at. The textures on the wall, candy machine, items in shop, posters all over the cities, and newpapers are completely horrible. It looks so pixilated.Overall at Launch I would say it is still a 7/10 because the world is big enough and the shooting is decent, just have a camera nearby because I have been taking pictures of glitches to show people.;7/10;11 December 2020;15 out of 29 found this helpful.
2K Games;Borderlands 3;Get ready to joypuke your face off...and roll your eyes.;May 2020 Edit: Borderlands 3 earns an additional point for it's outstanding post launch support. It's quality and frequency of updates are overall very good. These include: It's 15$ side story DLCs all 4 of which are more entertaining and pleasent compared to the main story. It's free events, raids and raid bosses, new missions, gameplay fixes, general content updates, weapon and skill buffs, level cap increases, limited time items, and of course a huge variety of new legendarys with some very clever and interesting new unique effects. Then there's whole new game features such as new skill trees giving basically 33% more versatility to each character, new item machines, an aniontment re roll option, new mayhem modes, the arms race game mode, that borderlands science thing, ect. This is on top of a game that already came out with a solid wealth of content.The only minor thing I'm disappointed with is the character updates. Borderlands 2 and PS had two DLC vault hunters, this game has none. While especially with the 4th skill trees the BL3 VHs have better variety than the BL2 VHs, they have all played pretty much the same since launch. If they can introduce another more exotic skill tree for each character and easier than that start doing new things with class mods, that I believe would make up for having only 4 characters. Still a pretty small complaint. This game has reached a whole new level of GUN P*RN. Well done devs, honestly.Review at release (8/10): Borderlands 2 was big leap forward from BL1 in story AND gameplay. Borderlands 3 is a step up ONLY in gameplay. Borderlands 3 is probably the most satisfying and punchy feeling FPS's I've ever played. With 4 different classes, tons of creative abilities, and an insane variety of core weapons along with legendaries with unique and goofy effects, the game is pretty much flawlessly executed in terms of being a fun first person shooter.Unfortunately BL3 clearly has lost most of it's writing talent from it's predecessor over the 7 years in between the games. The story is coherent enough, but it's held back by a pair of bad villians who you don't want to kill as much as you want them to shut up. Many old characters either don't return or are left out. I was esspecally disappointed that you only get to hang out with "The B team" (Mordicai, Brick, and Tiny Tina) at one minor point in the story. New characters are a mixed bag, but one negative highlight was Ava, a petualant and annoying pre-teen who is given way too much power and screen time for no reason. It's sucks they couldn't stike the right balance between good old and new characters like BL2 did.It's disappointing Gearbox could not follow up to one of my top 5 all time games with a better story, but it's hard to be mad when pretty much everything else is a slam dunk. Btw endgame is also superb, unless you're a raid boss fan.;9/10;10 November 2019;5 out of 7 found this helpful.
2K Games;Borderlands 3;Great, but has some bugs;I haven't completed the game yet, but I'm level 19 and can say it's quite fun. It has a few problems. Multiplayer is quite buggy, and will freeze sometimes. There are returning characters and all sorts of cool ways to destroy enemies. A little complaint I have is the villans here. They are a little weak, they can be a little intresting I guess, but they can't beat Handsome Jack at all.The gunplay is different feeling and still good. They combat mechanics are similar to Destiny, but this is a way better game than Destiny. It's just the combat that is similar. A great game, fun for everybody. However i recommend playing borderlands 2 first if you haven't, so you can appreciate the characters more. If your a borderlands fan you won't be disappointed. I give it an 8/10;7/10;14 September 2019;8 out of 13 found this helpful.
2K Games;Borderlands 3;Best Borderlands;This is the best of this series. The only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because it is not perfect. However, it is pretty close. The new quality of life improvements are great, gameplay is tight, and the story is very good. However, the main antagonists are not nearly as good as Handsome Jack, they try, but they dont quite get there. I will say, if the dlc finds a way to bring Jack back this game may hit a 10.;9/10;15 November 2019;8 out of 14 found this helpful.

2K Games;Borderlands 3;4 Stars out of 5 Stars;Directors Cut: (excludes Moxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot, Guns Love and Tentacles, Bounty of Blood, and Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fuster-Cluck, as I already reviewed all 4 dlcs on their own seperate Imdb pages)After beating Tales of the Borderlands, my friend and I jumped right into this game a day afterwards, and lemme just say. it was whiplash for sure. Bringing back characters like Claptrap with a new voice actor really bummed me out. Just didn't feel like Claptrap anymore, and actually kind of found him unfunny (unlike literally every other Borderlands game). I was also not entirely used to the new mechanics in this game, as it really does feel a lot different compared to the other 3 games (1,2, and the Presequel). They also introduced new villains who gain a huge cult following among the bandits. so much in fact, they become a cult that will do whatever they say. At first, I wasn't a fan of the brother/sister duo. I actually didn't really care at all. but soon, I found them to be pretty messed up and funny. The game does a lot of stuff right, like giving you more ways to enhance your character, finally letting you able to travel to different planets that isn't Pandora or it's moon Elpis, upgraded graphics/mechanics, so so so so many different types of guns. it's definitely far from bad. But I also didn't find the story to be as amazing as its predecessor, Borderlands 2, and that COULD be because Handsome Jack is no more, but it also could be because the game just isn't as greatly written as well. I'm not entirely sure, but it's still a great Borderlands adventure. The dlc, like mostly all of Borderlands dlc, is a must play too. The Directors cut extra content, like Arms Race was boooorrriingg, like who the hell wants to play Borderlands battle Royale? Definitely not me. All of the other extra missions the directors cut gives you is fun, although not very important in the overall plot, but enjoyable. In all, Borderlands 3 was fun, but 100 hours of gameplay is a lot, and it's also not on the same level as Borderlands 2, but still a must-play installment in the Borderlands machine.;8/10;5 July 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.

2K Games;Borderlands 3;Doesn't reach the heights of the previous games;The core gameplay mechanics work beautifully, shooting hasn't felt this amazing in a borderlands game before, the ability to slide and mantle onto ledges makes the core loop of shooting and looting even more satisfying than the previous games. But unfortunately those new additions can't save the game from poor pacing and a lackluster story that leaves much to be desired, mix that with really forgettable villains and a horrible mid section on eden 6 that last far too longBorderlands 3 definitely went the wrong road in story but the right direction in gameplayIf you're like me who loved the story of borderlands 2 you won't find that here If you're someone who is here for just the story and a laugh then it's definitely the game for youPros: Fantastic loot Movement system is a major step up New vault hunters are all a welcome additionCons: Boring story Empty worlds Poor pacing and mid section;6/10;25 October 2019;20 out of 23 found this helpful.

This kind of stuff just cracks me up just out of nowhere quotes that leave you thinking what does that have to do with anything. The different guns are always fun and unique guns are my favorite.

2K Games;Borderlands 3;Slightly disappointed;I love Borderlands. I love Borderlands so much, I got into its lore. The Borderlands series has a pretty good storytelling and gameplay to the point where I got sick of it, but keep coming back to it. I was hype when the 3rd game was announced because we haven't had a Borderlands game in a while for about 7, 5, or 4 years. The only thing that was turning me off was the controversy behind this game which made me a little worried. Then the reviews came out, I heard it was the best, it was the worst, it was mediocre at best, and I don't know how I feel about it. I got spoiled about a certain scene which left me disappointed. So finally during Christmas, I got the game.I do enjoyed the up-step gameplay they introduced, making the whole game more fun. The player's menu is something I'm trying to get used to since this is a new game. The fast-travel is a little issue to me. I don't like the fact that to able to travel somewhere, you have to locate where the fast-travel is to the place you want to good. I have heard about bugs and glitches before I bought the game and they're pretty noticeable. EX: Shooting at a bandit vehicle and makes an explosion sound but no explosion. Although I enjoy the gameplay, I don't like how it's giving me OP weapons everywhere I go. In the previous games, finding powerful weapons is slightly rare but here it's everywhere you loot. In the previous games, you upgrade your class to get better against challenging foes while in BL3, it doesn't feel challenging at all. It makes things too easy and unstoppable.I honestly don't know to explain the story in this game. Is lazy and uninteresting to go through. The main villains of this game is terrible to see and cringy to watch. This story ruins some previous characters of how they are and has ALOT of plotholes. After looking at Tales of the Borderlands and the Pre-sequel story, I thought the story would be better but nope they dumb it down.;5/10;17 February 2020;7 out of 10 found this helpful.

2K Games;Borderlands 3;Good game, just might me be my favorite in the series so far;Greetings from Lithuania.I have completed "Borderlands 3" at 100% on my PS5. This includes the main base game as well as DLC content - i have 100% everything. And after doing it can safely say that this game is a superb. If you liked previous games (i played them all), this part 3 is definitely going to win you over. The most boring part of it unfortunately was story. The main villains brother and sister was a good idea, yet writing in this game was way worse then in previous games. There were almost non good jokes, and the story was a mess for me. Yet as far as gameplay, gorgeos graphics, superb shooting, amazing loot and million of weapons this game is a superb. It took me 107 hours to 100% everything and i could easily play it for 100 more because variety of loot is just ridiculous.Overall, "Borderlands 3" is an amazing looter shooter.;9/10;5 August 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
2K Games;Borderlands 3;Great, but bugs ruin the experience... Why did they release it like this?;2 player split screen is not great at all. Lag is a consistent issue.

2K Games;Borderlands 3;Not the "best" looter shooter, but the fun one;First, and the most obvious part, the main story is really bad, cringe humor, half-baked story plots and annoying characters. It ignores what TPS set up with The Watcher, Athena and the "the upcoming war", and just made a mess out of things .The gunplay (for a lack of a better word) is superb, all guns felt really good to use (even the bad ones), all the little sandbox addition to the combat, like a more flesh out enemy variaty and AI, now you can punch barrels into enemies and make enviromental damage, like shooting an oil stain with fire nearby, or shooting water with electrical damage.The vault hunters are absolutely fantastic, their stories are interesting enough, and their abilities and build diversity are the best in all the series. Personally I am a believer in Amara Supremacy.The DLCs were well done, all of them are actually really good story wise and add a bunch of content to the game, and this without mentioning all the free post-lunch content, like the takedowns and the season events.This is a good quality game even without the DLCs, but if you can get the two season passes, this is one of the best looter shooter expirience ever and like it says in the tittle, maybe is not the best looter shooter, but is easily the funniest one to play.;7/10;10 December 2022;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
2K Games;Borderlands 3;Good-ish;Borderlands 3 is a butter-smooth game that finally eliminates the incredibly exhausting bullet-sponge experience. Not only that but maps are fun to explore because of their thematic uniqueness as opposed to those depressed vast open lands that are filled with repetitive enemies and monotonic colors. The fast travel option also saves a huge junk of your time. The vehicle gameplay could still be improved, sometimes I feel like I'm driving a yoga ball.The story was not that bad. I mean since when was Borderlands famous for its writing? Campaign was well understandable and straightforward, although some of the scenes just seemed to be coming out of nowhere and has almost no buildup. Your character contributes very little if no interaction to the story. It would have been better to have only one character that players can choose which class to attach with.;7/10;25 May 2022;1 out of 2 found this helpful.

2K Games;Borderlands 3;Unplayable in couch co-op;My wife and I are fans since the series begun. We have all the titles and DLC and clocked hundreds of hours in Borderlands2 alone. We totally pre-purchased Borderlands 3. It looked amazing in trailers and sneak peeks.We finished a 30 minute run on the game and we will drop it... totally unplayable, as the game doesn't support vertical split screen. Each player is left with an horizontal stripe of gameplay that is unsuitable for this genre, because you have to access lots of menus. Text is so small it becomes unreadable. We couldn't follow the action properly, and after 10 minutes, I gave up on the story and tips, just trying to get my bearings. Sound was awful even with a surround system, as voiced content faded away if you are not standing on top of the speaker.And then... the lag. Each time one of us opens a menu, the game completely stops for bit. Mind that we have a PS4 PRO, and set the game options for performance instead of resolution.Right now, it's a complete waste of money and time, if you are planning to play it with someone else. I'll stay away from it until they fix it. I don't want to hate it, but they are making it easy...;1/10;15 September 2019;10 out of 26 found this helpful.
2K Games;Borderlands 3;Turned it off and won't be going back any time soon;I'm a huge fan of the BL series. I own every scrap of content ever made for the BL universe, but this game just disappointed me so badly. It may not deserve a one star rating, but in relativity, it deserves zero. Everything from bugs and laggy menus, to the unplayable resolution mode, to the missions all seeming like chores, it just makes me sad this game didn't hit like it should have. I appreciate more content and QoL advancements, but there is really nothing that draws me in to this game and I can't wait to quit every time I start up.

Incredible stuff, so complex, so intricate, so diverse, it's as if it were nearly tailor made for me.With a great story, excellent customization options, solid replay value and an oddly enjoyable multiplayer mode I was positively gripped and set about to 100% the game. The difficulty curve is masterful and despite how intensely hard it gradually got I was never frustrated or driven away.It saddens me we don't get more titles like this, absolutely fantastic.The Good:Excellent all roundThe Bad:Fair few bugs, screen tears and other issuesHit chance ratio can get annoying;9/10;13 May 2019;13 out of 13 found this helpful.
2K Games;NBA 2K21;Sinister;Not only does this game provide absolutely NOTHING new or invigorating, it actively sabotages your enjoyment of the game to incentivize buying "tokens" to boost your stats.The second or third match in "career mode" is against a team of maxed-out superstars and you, for some reason, just switched over from football to basketball? In other words, your character is complete garbage and his stats are all way below what they should be. 2K would only do such a thing to infuriate the player. And after every game, of course, you have the opportunity to spend up to $100 to boost your stats...It doesn't take a genius to analyze the situation and come to the conclusion that this game is borderline PREDATORY in regards to monetizing in-game character skill development.Not to mention, in order to even play "career mode" you have to be connected to the internet and your system must be FULLY updated. So to actually play this game to the fullest on a regular basis you must pay $60 for the game, +\- $100 for decent stats, and +\- $80 per month for internet access so you can update this absurd copy/paste game daily.No kidding, this game made me very angry. I'm a calm person, but it's obvious that the game was engineered to frustrate the player into spending more on boosting character stats, etc. 2K should be more responsible with this kind of thing considering the entire world is falling into poverty and suffering from mental health issues.

Whatever happened to the L2/R2 reversal system they had in the first place. If it isn't broke don't fix it! Much like everything else these days the story mode highlights female empowerment, but not in a good way! This story almost goes full circle in the opposite direction of misandry. constantly making the male character out to be a buffoon amongst the weakest of wrestlers in history. I liked the idea of creating a male and female character for the story line, however I can't help feeling they could have capitalised with this as a power couple story line. On a positive note this game ensembles the very best roster in wrestling video game history and although frustrating. playable with a variety of modes. It also has multiplayer online access much like previous instalments! This is the first WWE game i had played since 2k14 so I came in with an open mind whilst expecting a vast improvement in them six years. Not much had changed except the games have become less fluent with their in ring grapple system. The online is awful because it's so hit and miss with lag, possibly one of the worst servers for online gaming in recent memory especially with a game reliant on a metre kick out system. If rocket league manages a good server so should this, no excuses available. Previous outings allowed you to put titles up for grabs with a history of your online win/lose record.

2K Games;Civilization VI;Time flies so fast!;This is my second Civilization game.Unlike the fifth episode, the leader's computer graphics have changed a lot. I don't like it because it seems far from the civilization game. Also, leaders of some civilizations do not seem appropriate. For example, while it is true that the Korean leader, Queen Seondeok, is a remarkable figure in Korean history, there are many more excellent figures in Korean history than she is. And one of France's leaders, Catherine de' Medici, was Italian and a political opponent of French master Henry IV, so I wondered whether it was appropriate.But the fact that the game is fun hasn't changed. The fun of pioneering and developing civilization has not changed. Also, the OST was great. A minor bug was not visible when I played. Addictiveness is a game comparable to drugs. Except for the disappointing points written above, it is a very high-quality game.;7/10;10 February 2023;1 out of 2 found this helpful.
2K Games;Civilization VI;An Honest Review;I was at war for the majority of the game, in one city that the AI couldn't manage to take. It was a war that I could largely ignore as I went about the rest of the game, and that is just not fun. When you keep it going just to see if the PC can think a way to take it... it doesn't make for a fun game.IV was my favorite and V I absolutely hated... and then came VI...... there are points of this that I like and would want to keep in future installments. And then there is, well...... once more it is like you are using a God Mod when you go to war, the AI still isn't there as far as strategy and you still need the ability to stack for it to be a threat.But, like V, if you are playing with friends... the wars aren't as bad and the new way is actually a lot of fun... but civ isn't exactly a game made for group play, it's more of an alone time killer.And it doesn't punish as much economically for having an empire, but it still discourages watching your armies sweep across the glob a little too much.But the killer is still stacking units for me. I don't want to play a game where I can fight a war without having the outcome matter. I want to be able to lose... and you really can't with an AI that can't think well enough to keep the artillery in the rear. When you let the computer stack, you have more fun because the computer is more of a threat.The AI isn't a strategic threat, and it still punishes the parts of the game that make it fun and replaces them with victories that aren't as satisfying to win.IDK, I am hoping in the next installment, they will change things back to a stack, or make the AI smart enough to use the new war mechanics effectively.;1/10;29 August 2022;4 out of 8 found this helpful.
2K Games;Civilization VI;big step down from civ 5;The animation is cartoonish and lame, the a.i. is the worst in any civ game by far, the map is confusing with three color schemes but two of the colors (in fog and unrevealed) are almost the same so it's very hard to tell the difference, it is way too easy to win, the districts idea is good in principle but plays pretty poorly in execution... maybe it is because we only have the basic game with no add-ons or dlc's, but that's the other problem. this entire game is all geared toward making us buy the dlc's to make the game actually good. i won't ever be buying another civ game in advance, only after reviews and packs come out, and we feel ripped off by this. going back to civ 5. much better game and way more fun.;2/10;16 December 2018;7 out of 23 found this helpful.
2K Games;Civilization VI;Seriously!;Why design a game that is so difficult for new players that you lose ten games in a row on the easiest difficulty setting? That should be at least normal setting for those who have played the pc versions for a long time. There is just so many insane micromanage everything with so many different bonus' that really make little to no sense at all. Custom game never works as the game just decides for you. Its just not even enjoyable or really even playable. Will never invest another cent into this developer again.;1/10;30 June 2021;2 out of 11 found this helpful.
Sega;Sonic Mania;Back to Basics;(Review based on Steam PC version) After the mediocre two-episode "Sonic 4" I was more tempered with Sonic Mania. Even though Mania looked to be taking a few more pages from the classics on the Genesis era I still went in largely skeptical and a bit blase about it if only for the fact this looked to be another heavy embankment on nostalgia more than trying anything really new. Returning levels had been done and not done well prior and I was mostly set up for an average experience. Still the development team lead by Christian Whitehead who helped port many classics and made a name for himself in the ROM hacking community did give me some encouragement.After three plays of Mania (Sonic+Tails, Tails, and Knuckles) I can say it's a worthy callback to the classics made by the hardest of hard core fans getting a sense more what made the originals good and not relying heavily on nostalgia. Besides Sonic 1-3&K we have homages and little hints towards every game in Sonic's long history. Sounds and nods to even the 8Bit Sonic games, Sonic CD, Genesis era games, a little of the 3D era and even Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine are all represented here and it works. Sporting new level aesthetics and character animations add extra touches and magic, such as lighting the oil on fire with a flame shield! Brilliant! Designs are like the classics (though let's not dig up the trivial "Waah Sonic has Green Eyes" nonsense) controls are like the classics everything is tightly focused and well polished as games that came before it.The music is better replicating the old 16bit soundtracks, better than Sonic 4's bland midi synth. Tee Lopes makes fantastic new tracks and great remixes of old stages too, but nothing musically will ever beat Sonic 3 & Knuckles but this comes pretty close. Still I didn't care for the mini boss music or the renditions of Stardust Speedway, which was based mostly on the Japan tracks which personally I found inferior to the U.S. Mixes and to the original. The original stages shine brightly and my praises there. My personal favorite has to be Lava Reef Zone 2 with the added guitars.The game's fault lies in the fact it had to go back to old stages again, 60% of the game is remade old stages. The stages do have many new added gimmicks and aesthetics to shake it up, more original stages. The ideas are there and whether by over cautiousness or executive meddling to much of this game is the old with a new coat of paint. Nevertheless I didn't find them boring or uninteresting so there is that.Mysteriously, moves like the Insta-Shield from Sonic 3 are absent from the main game. They are in the game but they're unlockables if you collect all the medals and only works in the No-Save game. This begs the question as to why something that should be in theory a standard move is behind an unlock wall and only in the No-Save game. There's also the super-peel out from CD though I didn't miss that much, I hardly used it in CD beyond the need to time jump but it's a fan favorite so I feel it should have been included.Sonic Mania is terrific even though it relies heavily on the old to give us something new it still finds ways to innovate the old without reinventing the wheel.;8/10;8 September 2017;4 out of 4 found this helpful.
Sega;Sonic Mania;Fast gameplay, punchy sound and popping graphics make for a platformer that exceeded my expectations;So, this game has beaten my expectations. You know sometimes when you hear so much about how good something is that you start to question if it really is that good? Well Mania was that game for me and do you know what? I have to agree with people that this is a fantastic game.The levels are fast, fun and exhilerating, the music bought a smile to my face, even the tracks inspired by the EU/JP soundtrack of CD, of which I tend to prefer the NA soundtrack and the graphics just pop out of the screen.Although I wasn't initially overly excited about this game (being more of a sucker for the 3D titles), the release smashed through the inital feelings and so far has provided me with a fantastic time.;8/10;5 May 2019;3 out of 3 found this helpful.

I strongly want to play the 3d titles and sonic 3, but Sonic Mania is still my favorite game of all time, the sprite quality is beautiful, the music is amazing, the balance between platforming and speed is perfect, the new levels are just a blast to play and while it is kinda disappointing that there are more old levels, they are remixed and feel fresh again. the main mode is so fun and so are all the others, expect for one, encore mode, it is the reason I give sonic mania a 9/10 but even with that I cant help but play this game over and over again.so I give sonic mania (plus) a 9/10;9/10;2 July 2019;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Sega;Sonic Mania;One of those modern goldies that plays like the oldies (Switch version reviewed);With two Sonic games coming out this year, Sega starts off strong with Sonic Mania, essentially a love letter to the Genesis titles made by fan-game creator Christian Whitehead and using his Retro Engine. Basically, this game is what Sonic 4 Part 1 and 2, which were average games at best, should be.The first thing I have to say is the level design is superb. They provide a nice balance between platforming and speed, and even with levels that were simply reused themes, such as Green Hill Zone, have some sort of twist. Controls are also nice and responsive (as far as gameplay is concerned) and works well with either single or duo Joy-Con play. The graphics also receive an upgrade from the Genesis. In fact, I could go as far as to say it's more like a 32x, maybe Saturn, game, and the animation is pretty fluid and bouncy. In the special stages, it goes into an Emerald Stage, which is chasing an UFO to catch get the Emerald, goes into a Saturn like style, which keeps use with the classic aesthetic the game has.If there are some issues I have, they're small, but they are noticeable. First of all, this is the Switch version I'm reviewing, and these problems seem to be exclusive for the platform. Also, from what research I've did, the port to Switch was done by Tantalus Media, who were responsible for many licensed games, though they do port jobs such as Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD, Zombi (which is basically Zombi U for PS4, Xbox One, and PC), and the soon to be release Rime for Switch, so I can't blame the main devs themselves, and I can only imagine the company will do a better job with Switch games in the future. Anyway, one of these two issues is that the special stages, which I'm sure isn't that demanding on the Switch, does drop frames. They're not big dips like 60 fps all the way to 15 fps. It just drops down to the 50s for a second and that's it, and that's if you experience it. Another, more noticeable issue is that the Home and Screenshot buttons have a delay. Yeah, you heard that right. These two buttons have a delay on the Nintendo Switch, and sometimes, they don't even work. Again, they're not gamebreaking bugs, easily overlooked even, but it's kind of disappointing that they exist. They should be fixed whenever they release a patch though.Simply put, this game is a love letter to the classic games of the Genesis, and whatever system you want it for, it's a must have, and even with the Switch version's problems, it's still the version I recommend getting, if you have one. It's simply that much of a blast, even without Blast Processing.UPDATE: Due to a recent patch that was FINALLY delivered. Not only did they fix the Home button issue, but they added a separate button for Super Form, which is now X instead of tapping jump twice, so no accidental transformations.;10/10;24 August 2017;5 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sega;Sonic Mania;One of the best Sonic Games ever made;I will start of by saying I am not a fan of sonic the hedgehog. The series has always had a lot of misses for me which is why I never got into it like many other people did. But I won't say the series as a whole is bad far from it. There are games In the series I really like such as Sonic 2, 3&Knuckles, Generations, Mania (which is what I reviewing right now), Rush, Unleashed, All stars racing Transformed, Sonic CD, Colors, Advance 1, Pocket adventure and sonic Riders which is a guilty pleasure of mine. This is one of the best games in the series that's not even made by Sonic Team. The people who made this did a fantastic job with it's soundtrack, visuals, controls, Content, level design, gameplay, and everything that makes an excellent 2D platformer. It's also full of refences to other games in the series which is great for long time fans and even to non sonic fans like myself. It has the save system from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, The ability to play as five characters if you download the DLC which is worth it by the way. The games bonus stages are fun as hell and the levels themselves are fast and well designed. It's basically like 3 & Knuckles but with more expanded on it. It's also one of the more challenging games in the series as well as having fun boss fights and some of them are creative. I may not be into sonic like a lot of other people are but I won't lie in saying that this game is amazing and is worth any gamers time/money.;10/10;13 October 2018;2 out of 2 found this helpful.
Sega;Sonic Mania;2D Sonic Awesomeness is back;Ever since I heard of this game being advertised I was hopeful. It promised a return to the bliss of early 2D sonic games. It also brings the style of those games and brings it into the present day with a mixture of revamped classic stages and new original stages as well. The game design is 2D platforming brilliance with a perfect difficulty spike and an incredible soundtrack.The graphics are crisp and vibrant with tight controls. It everything I ever wanted from a 2D Sonic game and I'll be playing it for a very long time.

Sega;Sonic Mania;Good for a nostalgic kick.;While this game is great for the nostalgia, the main game is over way too soon, which all the extra 'modes' just replaying the same game over again which different attributes of extra characters. I was very disappointed to not see the ability to play the original games (Sonic 1, 2, 3) or even a full iteration of the Mean Bean Machine. Being able to play through all the original games, not just this remake of a few chosen levels (No Marble Garden Zone?!?) would have added a lot of replayability and kept me playing for weeks, not for days. Great idea for a PS4 release, just not enough content.;6/10;2 October 2018;7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Sega;Sonic Mania;SONIC MANIA PLUS;"SONIC MANIA PLUS" (2018) was a huge event for classic Sonic fans and it was much appreciated. Beautiful sprites and wonderfully reimagined levels with a peppering of new zones and controls (as well as character diversity) and the encore mode made this the true successor to Sonic 3 & Knuckles (or as I prefer, Sonic 3 Complete).The levels are sprawlingly vast for Sonic games and the Blue Spheres and special stages are terrific. The game combines elements from the first 3 Sonic games and Sonic CD, but also makes references in a variety of ways to a plethora of characters, levels and more from the Sonic franchise.Unfortunately this game divided the already heavily sliced pizza that is the Sonic fanbase with many criticising the reboot feel of the game and others hating the new levels. While I would have preferred a straight up sequel to Sonic 3 and knuckles I was just ecstatic to have a new classic Sonic game to get to grips with.I would have liked more new zones and I also think Amy Rose should have been a playable character. See this game seems to have been made with nostalgia in mind and as someone who's been playing the classic Sonic games for over 20 years nostalgia just wasn't what I wanted. A completely new game with this game's aesthetics and gameplay would been another thing altogether. Other than that I have no comments that don't praise the game.Bring on Sonic Mania 2, 3 and so on.;10/10;16 April 2020;1 out of 1 found this helpful.
Sega;Sonic Mania;The true next step for Sonic, and one that shows him at his peak again;After the largely disappointing 2 episodes of the so called "Sonic the Hedgehog 4", it really seemed like any and all hopes for a truly excellent continuation of the classic genesis games were fading, and fast. Because what we got in 2010 was a lazy, idealess, and just bad game that had the balls to call itself the true 4th Sonic game, which it wasn't. Not even close. The 2nd episode was definitely better, but there were still major things about it holding it back from being truly anything good. So, with a very bad episode and a better, but mediocre at best one afterwards, the otherwise acceptable name of "Sonic the Hedgehog 4" was tarnished, and the future of main line 2D Sonic games were very unknown.However, something amazing happened. Apparently, I wasn't the only one with that mindset, as the incredibly talented Christian Whitehead and company agreed. And, came from the ashes thanks to their hard work and passion, one of, if not the best Sonic game ever made. The series was not only back, but arguably better than ever before. Because instead of shoehorning modern Sonic into a 2D plain and calling it a day, these guys expanded on literally everything that worked in the genesis games while staying faithful to them as well.Everything feels just about perfect here. The visuals are not only colorful and detailed, but they have an unprecedented amount of liveliness and character while staying true to the overall aesthetic of the genesis games. The music from Tee Lopes is phenomenal from start to finish-whether it be new tracks or recreations of old tunes, this OST is one of the best in a Sonic game. The gameplay is perfect as well, as Sonic and friends not only feel identical to how they did in the classic games, but Sonics moveset has been upgraded to incorporate everything from the super peel out to the insta-shield. The level design combines everything great about the level design of the great levels from the Genesis games. These levels have not only an over abundance of speed like in Sonic 2, but also a lot of fun exploration like in "Sonic 3 and Knuckles". Though here, the balance of these attributes is more akin to Sonic 2, though, because the levels here are a lot bigger in scope, here, there's still more than enough fun exploration to rival S3&K in that regard. In other words, the levels are not only excellent, but perfect for a Sonic game all around.Speaking of which, I think the way the developers went about the levels was perfect. One thing that always sort of bugged me was when people call this game a "collection" or a "compilation" of classic levels (which is, ironically, exactly what "Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I" was). While a lot of the levels in this game do return from previous games, there's a LOT more to each of them, as the level design consistently adds fun and fresh ideas, as well as completely expands upon the original ideas. Plus, the context as to why we're revisiting these places works wonderfully, and doesn't overshadow anything. Not only that, but the entirely new levels made by Christian Whitehead and company are all absolutely amazing, and do a perfect job in fitting in with the rest of the package. Overall, the levels have a balance of the greatness of the old with the greatness of the new, and because of how much newness is brought to the table, it all still works as a proper continuation of the series, as it helps make the Sonic series feel like it's own world.The special stages are also probably my favorite of the series, as, much like Sonic CD, you're in a 3D plane chasing a UFO, except, there's only one here. However, it also incorporates things like the blue spheres, but as collectibles to increase your speed, as well as rings to increase time. And if you mix that with the tricky, yet incredibly fun stage design, these special stages are excellent, and are accessed the same way the ones in S3&K, which I feel was the best way.Speaking of blue spheres, they're back, too-only this time, acting as a special stage accessed via checkpoints just like in Sonic 2. They're every bit as fun and satisfying to complete as they were in S3&K, but now look and sound much better. These are for tokens, which allows you to unlock a lot of goodies in the menus (won't say what to avoid spoilers). Though, because of how much bigger these levels are compared to the ones in Sonic 2, you'll be playing through these stages a lot-at least, far more than you would have for the special stages in Sonic 2. In other words, be prepared to have the blue sphere song stuck in your head after you 100% this game.Overall, this game is every single tiny thing the episodes of "Sonic the Hedgehog 4" should have been, as it is the first Sonic game in just about 23 years that actually pushed the envelope for the series. Everything here is just as good as it needs to be, and it is consistently one of the most enjoyable games in the entire series. If you're a Sonic fan who somehow hasn't played this yet, I implore you to change that. This is the true continuation after S3&K we've been waiting for for years, and to think it wasn't even made by the same people who made the classic genesis games just goes to show how a deep love and passion for the series can really revive it back to legendary status. What an amazing comeback to an amazing series. Here's to a Sonic Mania 2.;10/10;30 July 2022;1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sega;Sonic Mania;The Best Sonic Game Of All Time.;Sonic Mania was one of the best returns to form ever in gaming history. It came out with gorgeous graphics and enchanting level designs with an amazing soundtrack, many were clambering to get a physical version or a sequel of some kind.In the end we got a physical release but with a new DLC added. I have the digital version so I can't talk about all of the nice goodies that came with the physical version but I can definitely talk about the new content.While the new content isn't as awe-inspiring or as groundbreaking as the original it only adds to a perfect game and never harms it. The problem lies within it not having anything that new in terms of zones and levels. It's not that the game failed to implement new content. In fact it does it perfectly. It's just that the content isn't anything better than the full experience.Sonic mania plus comes with an all-new encore mode. Which it really is as the levels and zones have only been slightly modified. The game does give us a brand new version of mirage saloon though and gives us one act of angle island which is nice and enjoyable but not that expansive.The biggest changes that come to the game are the inclusion of mighty and Ray. Ray can fly like Cape Mario and mighty can walk on spikes like funky Kong. He can also slam and break blocks. He makes the game easier for new and unexpired players while Ray is useful for veteran players as he allows them to explore hidden areas within zones and discover some interesting secrets.The new special stages also change things up and some of the bosses have been redesigned. I was hoping to see a resigned final boss as I found it to have incredible music and nice build-up but to not be that interesting overall. Even then, I still like the boss. I like all of the bosses. Everything in this game goes above and beyond and with the DLC pushes it forward. Even with a few nitpicks here and there the game is still a true masterpiece with its colorful graphics and fantastic animation and awe-inspiring level design that rivals sonic 3 and knuckles. The soundtrack is heavenly and it is sure to have you playing it on loop with some of the best sounding music I have ever heard in video game history. A good example of that is the songs for the titanic monarch. Just go listen to it and even better play the game.Sonic mania plus only adds to what will go down as one of the greatest Sonic games of all time. Quite ironic it was made by a fan though.;10/10;10 August 2018;7 out of 23 found this helpful.

Sega;Persona 4 Golden;Most things are not as good when compared to an excellent successor;I decided to write this review to counter the one that said "it isn't as good as Persona 5".That might be true (yet to play Persona 5 due to not opening a PS4) but it is sort of like saying "Back to the Future 1 is terrible because it isn't as good as Back to the Future 2" or "Godfather part 1 is terrible as Godfather part 2 is superior". You could technically say those statements but it is dismissing all the work that the previous entry put into establishing the universe and system.Prior to playing Persona 4, I couldn't envisage how any game could top the story and characters of Persona 3. The overall system was a lot of fun, the characters and interactions memorable and the conclusion was brilliant. After playing Persona 4 though, I struggle to go back to Persona 3 as so many quality of life improvements were implemented in the 4 that makes 3 seem clunky by comparison. Somehow they also wrote even more engaging characters (Yusuke is more relatable than Junpei, Yukiko is more real than Mitsuru, Chie is more fun than Akihiko, Rise is less annoying and more helpful than Fuka, Margaret is way better than Elizabeth), a better location (spent a couple of years in rural Japan and Inaba is spot on for how these towns look and feel), and the gameplay was even better.The main downside for the game is that once the mechanics are understood (which is not difficult, the game holds your hand quite a bit) it becomes relatively easy. A few battles are still complex but mostly you want the shadow world sections to finish so you can get back to the story. Spend a bit of time at the beginning grinding extra levels and the game is very easy as you are almost always ahead of the difficulty curve.I can imagine that with everything that is great about Persona 4 is made even better in Persona 5 and the few problems are fixed up making Persona 5 seem like the better game. That is the nature of game development. But if you have played 5 and want more of the series, go back and play 3 and 4 but judge them on their own merits and enjoy the story and the people you meet along the way.;10/10;15 December 2019;16 out of 17 found this helpful.

Sega;Persona 4 Golden;Time to Make History;After playing Persona 5, I really wanted to play more Persona games. Persona 4 Golden released on steam last year, so I finally got the chance to play it. The story in Persona 4 is really good and very engaging, even if the writing is quite weak at times. The additional story in Golden is not anything special but it's fine. The gameplay on the other hand, not really. While the combat system itself is enjoyable, I'm gonna explain later why the gameplay overall is not as good as the story. The main characters are the best part of the game and their interactions are probably the best I've seen in any videogame. The music took some time to grow on me but I ended up absolutely loving it! The art style is nice, although the visual quality is a bit outdated. Also, it's worth mentioning that the dialogue is hilarious at times... like, it had me laughing out loud! Persona 4 Golden is undoubtedly one of the funniest games I've ever played. Now, Persona 4 has one issue that affects the gameplay though. the dull dungeon design. The dungeons in that game are literally copy/paste, empty corridors, which is something Golden could improve on but it didn't. For those who've only played Persona 5, imagine something like Mementos. Another issue is the saving system in the dungeons, it's unnecessarily complicated and it made me lower the difficulty in some parts.Pros: + Great story + Awesome characters + Decent combat system + Exceptional music + Cool art styleCons Inconsistent writingPoor dungeon design & complicated dungeon saving systemNarrative: 8/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Content: 8/10 Characters: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Art Style: 8/10Final Rating: 9.5/10 Outstanding -I gotta say, playing Persona 4 Golden after Persona 5/Royal made me realize how much Persona 5 improved upon its predecessor.Much like Persona 5/Royal though, Persona 4 Golden is one hell of an experience! One that I hopefully won't forget anytime soon, as it's truly one of my favorite games I've played in a while.Do I recommend it?: Yes! Go treat yourself with some Persona, either 5 or 4, it doesn't matter.;10/10;19 January 2021;6 out of 7 found this helpful.
Sega;Persona 4 Golden;One of the best games;Excellent story and really fun to a point that when I stop playing I kinda feel sad lowkey!Only downside is that I think "normal" difficulty is a little bit too hard for normal, but still u can change it to easy anytime if u want.Personally I changed difficulty to recieve small damage and do big damage and get more XP, do this if u are looking for fun and playing otherwise u must grind hard even for normal.TLDR: super fun, play on easy.;10/10;16 April 2021;5 out of 6 found this helpful.
Sega;Persona 4 Golden;Change;I love this game, it enter on my life in a hard part, i didnt have a way to follow, this game make me a rutine on my life, always i wanted to finish everything to plays this game, the message of self acceptance did change my way to express my personality to the other people, his battle sistem is funny, easy to understand, the mistery tematic feels real, the Social links feels like persons, everyone with different personalitys, problems, and plot, the investigation team feels like more like a group of friends than a team, its like the investigation its secondary, they are teenagers, and they act like it, the difference in the way that the world of television is presented is fascinating, and above all its differences, being like a completely opposite world with few comparisons, the bosses feels real, I feel like bosses are like a repressed part of each character's personality. It feels like you are discovering the mystery with the characters, almost prompting the player to deduce it without the need for the story, as it happened to me, sometimes when I was busy I would analyze the information to deduce who is the murderer.and the final boss, despite being a classic in most jrpgs, I like the detail that basically with enough attention, you can know that it is the final boss, something as simple as a trip to another school, it warns you of something as colossal as the final boss, it's something simple, but I love it. Im not going to explain the all soundtrack, i got enough with the hours listening literally the entire ost, but in resume, my favorite ost of games and the best that i did listen to, 10/10. ITry to rate this game without taking into account my experience with persona 5. But the truth does not disappoint, if you come to consider the worst because person 5 is better, look for a better way to criticize, it is simply absurd.;10/10;15 July 2023;0 out of 0 found this helpful.
Sega;Persona 4 Golden;So Disappointing When Compared to Persona 5;I mean there are so many problems that suck any fun I had with this game. First with the positives: 1.Characters-Most of the characters are interesting & have a good arc to them. 2.Story/Plot-The mystery in this game is suspenseful as it was the biggest reason I kept playing this game. 3.Location-Inaba is a quiet, peaceful, & happy town where there isn't any dark gloomy atmosphere like there is in Persona 5. However, the negatives take a lot of the fun away as so: 1.Gameplay-Oh my goodness, what a disappointment. It's a pain to learn & get used to. Plus the enemies (even on normal mode) spam the most powerful attacks that takes half your health away! (Jesus!) 2.Save Points-SRSLY! Only ONE save point in each dungeon & that's at the very end of each dungeon! That's stingy & speaking of stingy: 3.Chest Keys, SP, & Yen-I've never had a game that was so stingy on allowing you to unlock chests, earn plenty of money, & limited SP. This game is the most stingy game I've played ever! 4.Enemies-Not much variety & again, they love to spam the most powerful moves even on the easiest difficulty! This takes all the fun away from the game when I have to restart hours of gameplay! Overall, very overrated & disappointing game. Made me write a serious review on it. This game is average at best & go play Persona 5, it's sooooo much better!;5/10;13 November 2019;4 out of 46 found this helpful.
