If you ask me to check my oil, I'll have a panic attack because I don't remember where the little stick is. I take my car in for a yearly checkup and they can take care of all that stuff.I have just spent an excruciating amount of time trying to find out why a car makes ""constant banging sounds,"" only to discover that the rusty parts that were eluding me were little round things called Rubber Bushings. I'm only a few story missions in, so I don't know what a rubber bushing is yet, but I will not cheat and google it! Hopefully my journey will eventually lead me to the answer.I bought this game because I like simulators and wanted to learn more about cars, sine they're such an important part of our lives. It's a big challenge from the start if you don't know anything about cars, but I wholeheartedly recommended it! It feels damn good when you figure something out.

If you love cars, made models of cars, or even enjoyed playing with Legos as a kid. You will enjoy yourself playing this game. --9/10 my personal rating of this game.I work on cars as a hobby/side hustle, so there are things missing in this experience that you have to deal with in reality, that I wish were in this game (but I still think should be optional if a player does not wish for all the extra hassle)...i.e. --Wiring--transmission parts and fluid (magically all one piece)--differentials, covers, gears, oil and otherwise (magically all one piece)--brake lines, and no process of having to bleed air and bad fluid from brake calipers and brake lines--torquing the lug-nuts once you put wheels back on.--tie rod alignment (just to clarify, that means specifically the tie rods, more specifically tie rod thread count. Anyone who has changed a tie rod before will know what I am talking about... I am not referring to wheel alignment which is in fact in the current game).--parking brake cables, handles or shifter handles--no gaskets, no intake manifold gaskets, exhaust manifold gaskets, no head gaskets (metal to metal and somehow everything is magically sealed.--no interior panels for doors, no window motors/regulators, locks, handle rods, lock rods.--no dash/instrument cluster--no heater cores--no hoses or lines for EVAP related parts, cooling system, or fuel.--no ball jointsand the interior stuff is kinda lackluster... there is more to the interior of a car than seats, benches and steering wheels.In the future, this game should let us customize the dashes, the shifter, the gauges, the radio/stereo, the carpet/floor material and color. Just a few ideas I had.If the game had a bit more of these realistic aspects to it, I would give it a rating closer to 10. As it stands, it is an excellent game!

While we expected it to be good, It Takes Two, the sophomore effort from developer, Hazelight, impressed us so much, it is now the benchmark for which I will measure future co-op game experiences. We simply lost count of how many charming moments we encountered whilst playing.I could go on and on, but, the selling points of this game are best experienced for yourself.Each painstakingly detailed level in this title offers you unique gameplay mechanics that are never recycled. Communication and cooperation are a must, as well as decent twitch response reflexes. Various mini-games are scattered around the environment, and give you a slight reprieve from your main objective, only to get your competitive juices flowing. (sore losers need not apply!) Controls are tight and responsive, and the camera does a decent job of keeping track of the action. However, those who suffer from motion sickness may occasionally become disoriented or even nauseated due to the mandatory split screen. Overall, this is a very high quality, one of a kind experience that could only be produced as a labor of love. Pick this one up, play it with someone special, and let the hilarity ensue.Highly recommended.;5 April, 2021;

Just soup, because it was easiest to manage in large batches. I had the process for like 5 soup recipes completely memorized.

Cooking Simulator;Verrice;NOT INFORMED;180 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 23.0 hrs on record;"I really like the idea of this game. I like this game... but... man there are a lot of issues here. I will, likely, keep playing the game and really hope they improve things and maybe even take some of my suggestions below, but in this state, I cannot recommend this game to anyone else, and I'm pretty shocked it has a ""Mostly Positive"" rating right now. This isn't early access anymore...Let's break it all down:PouringPouring things into other things is cumbersome. Finally have gotten used to pouring soup from a pot into a bowl and getting close to 300ml, but would MUCH rather use a ladle, even if it was 50ml at a time. it's more realistic and much easier to control (unless I have to aim and tilt. just give me a ""pour into thing"" option). Also, there's no aiming help when pouring from a pot or other similar items (like there is for purchased liquids), and on a flat screen, the lack of depth perception really hurts this (more on that in cutting later).With the pots, however, at least you can see the liquid level, so it's not too hard to tell where the start of the pouring is. The bottles and cartons, however, are totally different. Because it's so difficult to stop the pour at the right moment, you want to have low volume things pouring slowly, and to do that you have to very slowly move the mouse until it starts to pour. If you could see the level, then it would be easier to tell when it was going to start.What I'd REALLY much rather have is the interface like the sink for all pouring situations (and the ladle idea above). Push button to start pouring, push it again to stop, done. There's enough other challenge that the current mechanic is just annoying.Spatula/TongsFlipping food is a nightmare. Once you have the item on/in your utensil, you have to hold down shift, carefully maneuver the utensil forward, left/right, and down (but not too far or your pan will disappear into the stove and throw everything else in it, on the floor), then hold down the right-mouse button (still holding shift), and carefully move your mouse sideways to turn the item over. If you let your mouse go forward or backward at all it might crash into the pan and (again) cause it to disappear and throw it's contents on the floor. Then, assuming you did all that correct, you either release or drop it, and have to be careful where your utensil ends up because it might run into something and... cause your pan to disappear into the stove (worst case) or fling something to the other side of the kitchen.Leaving the spatula and tongs as they are would be okay (well the tongs anyway) if, at least, you couldn't accidentally push them into the pan or other objects and cause them to go flying, or really move at all.Knife SkillsCutting seems simple enough... put think on cutting board, grab knife, focus cutting board, align the line where you want to cut, and cut. Easy. The issue is, however, you can't really look around once you have your line where you want it, so getting perfect cuts is incredibly difficult for something that even a new cook could do more easily. In real you build up muscle memory and can improve on this, but here, it never gets any better. Sure, you can add a perk to slow down time, and you can add a perk to keep the food from moving, but that's only minimally helpful. Maybe a perk that eventually lets you cut things into even parts (you pick how many) automatically? Not sure... I don't want to take away all the feeling of getting in there with your hands, but the current implementation is just irritating.Moving StuffAgain, more awkward controls. If you want to just put stuff on a plate, easy, hold plate, click each thing, boom. If you want to arrange things, however, putting them in a particular place requires using the cumbersome shift mechanic, which I'm sure I will get faster at, but it will always be an un-enjoyable mechanic. Maybe better would be something like, hold down the right-mouse button, and then use WASD to position, QE to rotate, and just snap the Z to be above whatever is there (i.e. if you move a potato (with WASD) over another potato on a cutting board, the moving potato would just pop to right above the placed potato, and when you move off to only be over the cutting board, then it snaps down to just above the cutting board.The MouseSimilar to moving stuff, the mouse is a major detractor in this game. First thing that helped a lot was to turn off the mouse easing or whatever that setting was. The second is to turn the sensitivity almost all the way down (even on my gaming mouse that I can adjust on the fly, at its lowest setting still needed the game turned down). Other interfaces, however, still move way too fast or strange. The little mini-screen that appears when you deliver the food, for example, is crazy hard to control, which can really irritate you if you have just seconds left to deliver a dish.If you're going to base nearly EVERYTHING on mouse movement, then that mouse control needs to be dead-to-rights perfect. this game's mouse implementation is rough, at best. Tune the sensitivity better, and even it out across all interfaces, it shouldn't suddenly be faster in one area than another, unless you're going to allow for separate controls for each movement type's sensitivity. MenuWould MUCH prefer this felt like a menu I maintained for the restaurant, rather than just a series of unlocks. If a real restaurant found that a recipe was not meshing well (from a productivity perspective) they could drop it from the menu, but I can't do that. Also, I was hoping to be able to create a new recipe and add it to the menu, rather than just picking from a catalog. That would help it feel more realistic too.In Game GuideWhile there are ""sticky notes"" all over, and a tutorial, nothing really teaches you the mechanics. For example, it took a long time to figure out that 300g of potatoes, which require 6g of salt, should have 3g of salt put on each potato before you cut them or you will forever get ""too much salt"" or ""not enough salt"" critiques. What does it mean when there's a red border around an item, after the green bar fills up, but before the red bar starts? I assume it means it is at risk for burning, but nothing in the game ever talks about it (unless I've missed it).MiscellaneousIf boiled potatoes should have 20g of salt, then adding that salt after the potatoes are in the water should be fine, but if you get the salt on the potato instead of the water then you get marked down. In real, you could just as easily add the salt after the potatoes...How many people, in real life, have opened an oven door into their plate and ended up shattering said plate all over the floor? I'm willing to bet significantly fewer people than the number of plates I've broken, in this game, at the oven.Speaking of broken plates... where's the broom and pan? Pick up one shard, throw away one shard, pick up another shard, throw away another shard, repeat about 8 times... ugh...An oven at 93% looks like it's crazy unhygienic. It took a while of rubbing 'wear' marks with a sponge to realize what that was. Rather than a progression of wear that shows visibly like that, why not have a progression that increases the chance of it breaking (can be reduced with regular maintenance), but doesn't necessarily show on the outside. Just know that the last time you had it maintained or fixed was x days ago or whatever.You can't fit a pan in front of a pot on the stove. This annoys me to no end because I like to keep my soups on the back burners, and use the front burners for active cooking. Instead, I can only use either two burners for soups, and two burners for pans, leaving two back-burners unused.Again... I really like the game, but it seriously frustrates me, and because of that, I cannot recommend it.";21 June, 2019;

Car Mechanic Simulator 2018;Higuchi;NOT INFORMED;152 people found this review helpful23 people found this review funny; Recommended 143.4 hrs on record;I had no business playing a game related to cars. I went into this thinking that the only thing making a car go vroom vroom was an axel. I have learned I was wrong.And yet, now, I have enjoyed the game immensely. as of writing this I have 100+ hours on this game that I might have otherwise spent on some RPG or sandbox game. Now I get to enjoy the look on my grandfather's face when I ask him about front and rear double wishbone shock absorbers and V8 2carb OHV supercharged engines.This game has a lot of self-learning. For those just starting, I highly recommend:1. Do the 'tutorial' (which is more like a quick sandbox) and take apart and put together the cars provided piece by piece. Also, make sure you look at every station around the garage, including the warehouse, the parking garage, the painting room, the two tire-related machines, the oil drainer thingy, the engine remover crane, the engine block stand, the shock assembler mechanism, the battery charger, and the welder and interior fixer-upper. Each will be super useful once you unlock them and you'll want to know they exist and where to find them.2. When you do a job: when you look at the car's information, pieces that you have identified that need to be replaced have a little grey star next to them. If you click the star, that part will highlight in the car itself. This will help you find it and replace it! Super useful when you have no flipping idea what an Inner Tie Rod is or what it looks like, right? The game never tells you this, unfortunately.3. When choosing jobs: focus on Brakes, Gearbox, Exhaust, and Body. Engine and Timing take forever. Suspension involves mystery bushing shenanigans. For money, focus on the Gearbox ones. For speed, focus on Exhaust.Jobs will have little white symbols for what each job will require. Luckily the game eases you into it with one type of job at a time so you can get used to them, until eventually they're flinging everything at you with wild abandon like my brother when he's looking for something in his room.Everything will become streamlined once you know what you're looking for. I don't even need to highlight anything now. My knowledge has shot up from 'Flintstone car locomotion' to 'v8 custom gearbox tuning' and it feels great.Don't forget to open your Mystery Cases though. I spent an hour opening my backlog of like 100 of those things. It was the longest surprise party ever.;16 July, 2019;

In fact, the higher power your car has, the more weird it is to drive, even with Racing Slicks. This is Car Mechanic Simulator 2018. This is not Gran Turismo, this is not Fast and the Furious, this is nothing that you'd want as a racer. Racing is not here, except for time trials for the sake of testing your tuning. If you were expecting anything of the like: This is not your game.Now, for the title, does this provide an excellent view of the parts of the cars and all that stuff that at first may confuse you? Yes. It is good for learning the basics. But, do not expect to be an absolute expert on the matter because there are details, oh so many details, that have gone missing compared to its strongest competitor: Wrench.If you are looking to have some casual, stress-relieving fun while fixing cars or making Junkyard Rescues? Pick this up. No doubt about it, this may even be right up your alley. But, if you want to get your money's worth, get yourself this game on sale. Do NOT go lower than 50%. I'll explain why: DLC feels like at least 50% of this game, and not in a good way. At all. The Mercedes-Benz and the Chrysler Packs are neat touches, but they are a little bit too expensive, the latter only bringing you two... Yes, TWO cars! For a regular price of $5 USD. Mercedes is a tad bit more expensive, but the cars are seldom of any interesting value except for the sake of engineering history. Let's talk about one of its major, well TWO, major problems: Slow progression, and endgame.Before the comments fly at me about how this is just a casual game and I shouldn't be too harsh, hear me out: This is a simulator, yes. It will NOT cater to everyone and it will certainly cater to a specific kind of audience. I know this. But if you are going to charge us a good amount of dosh for DLC, at least ensure you are getting the content is actually worth the spending.Yes, licensing is expensive. No, this does not mean it justifies you putting up yet another V8 Engine that is seldom of any difference to the already plentiful V8s that we have. Yes, sometimes even the V8 OHVs of the game, are of similar performance to the Modern V8s! (Provided you tune them right, that is.)Now, the issues.Slow Progression: You start with a one-car Garage as you begin your career as a Mechanic. Sounds logical, right? Well, thing is, the EXP gain by this stage can get tedious and slow and you will see yourself burning yourself out quickly at the start. It also does not help that the Tutorial does not help you much, since it only provides you with vague details of items that you must be around Level 30 (correct me if I am wrong, please). By the time, you would have already forgotten about it. Money is seldom a problem, as long as you meet the minimum repairs, you are good.Endgame: This sounds ridiculous for a casual game, I know. But once you reach Level 30, you are done with the game. Unless you haven't done the story, that is. Once those missions are done, there's nothing else left. This is when, thankfully, the Steam Workshop comes into play. You can count on the community into making some great models for Real Life cars for you to do Junkyard Rescues. Just be careful at the amount of cash being played there. Some of these are mostly there to serve as Cash Farming or even go at ridiculous prices that make you break your own economy to the point where you can reach $10,000,000 with just the repair of a car from a Junkyard, while your initial investment was only of $750,000 or even less. I'm looking at you, McLaren F1 LM.Now, with the issues out of the way, let's go with the things I really like.The Music: The EDM Music Radios are actually nice to hear, at least for most of the tracks. Chances are you will enjoy the other genres too. For these songs being Royalty-Free (for the most part), they are not as obnoxious as Super Street: The Game's. This being said, the game allows you to create your own playlist to be played in-game. Just dig in through your game files and you'll see it.Details and Parts: With so many parts for so many cars this time around, this feels like it has more content and as such, you may feel that the initial price tag is less painful to bear. Especially if you compare it to the earlier entries to the game. Most of the cars that you will find in the base game are recreations of real life cars with altered looks and different names. However, when you dismantle engines, be it your standard I4, Straight 6, or even their recreation of the LS1 Engines... You can clearly see at least a certain degree of detailed work on the parts and other tidbits as you assemble it. (You can even install Racing-Spec Parts, but this requires DLC.) The models may look generic, but you will be presented with plenty to work with. Don't be surprised, this is a rather small studio, after all. Licenses, again, are expensive.Steam Workshop Support: Perhaps the current most important feature, and even what is keeping this game alive. As stated earlier, reaching the level required for the 3-Slot Garages feels like you have already beaten the game, because even with story missions, you do not feel like you are doing much. Except maybe getting a crate or two with RNG parts with boosted stats from +1 to +5. They share the same parts that they have added in for their cars in the base games and maybe some from the DLC, but other than that? Do not expect much, other than the body panels. Still, it feels great having some JDM being worked on, when they only gave us Mazda.In short: If you are interested in cars, and know almost next to nothing about them? Get this, it'll shed some light in you, even if just the basics. Maybe even spark an interest in fixing your dad's '69 Camaro? That's your own choice, though.However, do I recommend the game? Yes. It can be fun if you got absolutely nothing to do. Just note that you should not expect 100% accuracy when fixing these machines, because the lack of detail when compared to Wrench, is meant for it to be accessible for newcomers. Get this game on sale, do not go lower than 50%. Also, here's the must have DLC, in no particular order: - Pagani Pack (So many V12 Car Mods, it's Sebastian Vettel's dream pack.)- Tuning Pack (It's Free!)- Rims Pack (Mods need it)- Garage Customization DLC (Also free!)- Maserati Remastered Pack (Not exactly a Must-Have, but I have seen mods require it.)You may ignore the rest, as they all feel redundant and do not exactly bring any significant difference to the game experience whatsoever.All in all, this is a great game for relaxing. But for the base game being at $20? Absolute rip off. Don't pay more than $10 for this.;5 June, 2020;

He can rebuild an entire engine in under an hour. He can slot in an entire exhaust system as if it's Lego. He can somehow remove the fuel pump without removing anything else on the car. He can determine the exact condition of a set of brake pads through the rims and caliper. Everything is an exact percentage to this man, not ""good"", ""worn"" or ""needs replacing"". Hell, he can replace a timing belt in a matter of seconds. I envy this man.If you like playing as god, and like working on cars without doing the tedious stuff (or working on literally any French car), then this is the game for you.In all seriousness, this game helps you learn a lot about the different parts of cars and what they do. I'm no mechanic, I just got a lot of experience on repairing my own cars because they've either been French or just old run down junkboxes on wheels. But this is enjoyable. It's satisfying refurbishing cars, and rebuilding engines. Obviously, it doesn't cover absolutely every aspect. But it will probably give you a much better idea of what the mechanic's telling you when you ever have to take your own car into a garage irl, instead of going ""Oh yeah, oh ok, yeah replace whatever tf that is please"".Great game to pass the time, and also learn a bit about cars on the side.9/10 - Only a couple of crash bugs going into barns, but otherwise a neat game.";12 June, 2021;

If you're coming in expecting to immediately restore and sell cars for big dosh, guess what, you're gonna to be doing a lot oil changes and brake jobs first because, yes, it is a simulation of you building your talents and reputation as a skilled carsman.When you first try to repair parts, most will turn to dust because you have big, clumsy hands. You WILL dump oil on to your shop floor because you forgot to drain it before removing the oil pan. You WILL struggle to find the one valve pushrod that's causing the loss of engine power to complete your order unless you pull off the engine heads and investigate. You WILL spend an hour and a half figuring out where and what a fuel pump is.However, you will get better, AND you'll unlock tools like compression testers and fuel pressure testers to be able to find the problematic parts, and there-in resides the satisfaction of CMS 2018. You enter as a total neophite, not knowing a thing about how cars work --probably magic-- but as you progress, it starts to make sense. Fuel? Oxygen? Ignition? That's the recipe for GO FAST.When you've gained enough experience --and levels-- the parts you attempt to repair will more consistantly come out gleaming. factory new. Your garage expands, and now you can repair framework and body parts. The knowledge you've gained spending hours changing filters and swapping leaf springs makes your orders a breeze, and now you have some money to go searching for a ride to make your own. You've found a fastback in a barn. You take it home, and now it's your baby. You pull off the wheels and attend to the suspension. replace the con-rods and pistons with performance parts: Performance plugs, flywheel, ignition wires and filters. Suddenly, the wallflower in the corner is the prom queen at the drag strip because she's doing 0-60 in 4.03 seconds and putting down 491 horsepower on the dyno.You don't sell her though.

Only timed laps are available, and then only on a single circuit- Faster cars are virtually uncontrollable with mouse & keyboard, so be prepared to switch to a controller- The drag strip is only available with purchase of the Pontiac DLCFinal Notes:Like a relationship, you'll start off holding hands and swapping fluids and it'll be confusing. sometimes painful.

I'm from Catalonia, every week I go to Barcelona and drive arround this streets.The scenario is amazing, surprisingly well designed. Full of details that I've you have been here, you will notice. Also it's translated in Catalan after a big pressure of the public, so it's nice the company understood that it was a good point to have it in our language.But when the amaze of driving in a videogame on the streets you know dissapear, this game feels unfinished and the simulation is really poor.The gameplay is not complex. I didn't feel like being a taxi driver. It's a driving simulator arround BCN. And the driving feeling is awful in joystick (and this is very important as few steering wheels are supported IN A DRIVING GAME!). The driving is counter-intuitive, making a ride in joystick is impossible, as you don't feel anything, you don't have any motivation to drive correctly.The AI makes a big snowball in the game. Other cars are simply stupid. The AI seems from 20 years ago. They drive slow, crash for no reason, at all time, you are stopped and crash. The make also stupid traffic jams. All this make your passengers to loss patience and then you fail your ride. All this affects your money, progression... I only completed 2 RIDES IN 4h!Passengers of your taxi are boring. In 4 hours of gameplay just 1 made a conversation. And conversations...They ask you for a place to visit, you suggest a museum, he feels anoyed because he doesn't like museums (how i suposed to know?).NPCs walking arround street feel like you are playing a 2000s game. They do NPC things, as walking in a very strange way. They are soooooo creepy. They do nothing. Menus are not good, and also you cannot accept passengers if you don't go to that map that's not good.Big lack of optimization (3060ti+32RAM) and textures of other cars are simply from another generation compared to yours.Also some major bugs that affect gameplay. Feels like an unfinished game. I'm so sorry, because the idea is quite good, but when the amaze of driving in a city I know very well, the feelings are really bad. I hope this changes in a future.; 8 March Pro;

That's what Songs for a Hero did to me. I'm keeping a much closer eye on Brazil in the future, because this game is a total work of heart and love for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive era of gaming.See, Songs isn't just trying to play on your nostalgia - it wants to be your nostalgia in the best ways possible. Not only does it sing to you in a wonderfully comedic fashion, but if you turn off the singing (which you can do if it bothers you) then you find an amazing homage to Wonder Boy and several other Sega titles layered into it. Sound effect and music design, physics and motion, and the look itself have all meshed into one of my favorite games of 2020. There were challenging points in the game, but never a point where I blamed or questioned the devs for why it was so hard.If that hasn't told you enough about why this game is worth your time and money - I put down Animal Crossing for two solid days to play this from start to finish because the initial taste pleased me so much.---I also want to add something more for people who enjoy reading - I got to talk to and hang out with the developers from Dumativa. They're a team from Brazil who offered me the chance to play this for free on my stream. I was shocked and amazed how many of them came by not just to thank me for playing the game, but to see someone from another country play it, love it, and even get misty-eyed over this shocker of an indie title. They're people who (like the people at Double Dash) I love to call friends now.

It might seem such a simple detail, but it actually creates a very impressive atmosphere. And the gameplay itself is that classic, good ol' 2D platformer we all know and love. There is a good deal of exploration to this game, and the items make the gameplay very interesting. Of course, there are a few parts where there's simply nothing much to sing, but that is actually better than if they decided to go full on looping the same parts that you've already heard. For now, this game unfortunatelly does not have an English version, meaning that only those who undestand Brazilian Portuguese would be able to play for now... However, there apparently are plans for an English release later on, so I recommend, yes, for those who already understand Portuguese and for those who don't, look forward for the (possible) English release later on and I guarantee: You won't regret.

There isn't a large variety of houses to flip. The game has around 20 houses for you to buy and sell, some have nuclear bunkers, but most of them are just the same style house and roughly the same shapes and sizes.You can't make the yard better, there is no lawn mowing, no outdoor gardening all you can do is change the panels outside, but only on a single storey, there is no way to panel a second story currently.There is also a huge lack of furniture in the shop, and a lot of it is dated, there are also no kitchen wall cabinetsNO MODDING SUPPORT CURRENTLY - if the devs were to add modding support for people to make custom houses and furniture items it would make the game much better as people could be more creative.BUGS, and I'm not talking about the cockroaches, im talking about game bugs. One that I've noticed is that the more lights you have on the less frames you will get. I've only noticed this on the highest graphic setting but it's still a bug.I still recommend the game but just know this is a new game and it's bound to have issues, the devs are working on it still, and it has a lot of potential.Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

I also essentially sold a sex dungeon to a man called Jimmy Traitor who whenever I place a child’s object in any house I am building tells me “Those aren’t my kind of toys”. I’m forever struggling to understand why the one potted cactus makes the house instantly more appealling to the “I like creative disaster” woman and why everybody is so horny about bookshelves, why the room that has been a living room for the past half an hour is suddenly classed as a kitchen oh god Giorgio’s pissed at me again.Lovely and relaxing and calming I may say, but then again they give you a hammer and there are walls, you can take out *whatever you like on them*. You can knock all of the walls down, you can sell the doors, you can sell the WINDOWS, you can make the worst house in the history of houses ever created and the AIs will still buy it for a profit.I built a house and filled it with baths. Just baths. Only baths. It was chaotic. It was brilliant. Jimmy Traitor bought it? What does he want with all these baths? Is 2 the limit for Giorgio?Let’s not even speak about the gardening DLC in which you are graded on coverage and variety of plants which increases the house sales price yes I’d like to mention the £200,000 profit I made on a property because I *ran around their lawn randomly placing daffodils for an hour* Oh and forget the confusing logic behind the animal crossing shovel, the house flipper shovel has SEEN THINGS. But seriously, I love this game so much, it has so many different things going for it and you can be as chill or as serious as you want to be. I am freed from the shackles of powerwashing and fully invested in real estate. As somebody who currently can’t do too much because of illness this game… I mowed the lawn mum.If you need a new game to play and are looking for something different, a little slower maybe, I would recommend this game. FYI it is a bit pants without the DLC but still very playable and enjoyable.Thanks for coming to my TEd Talk ???;17 June, 2023;

Robin Hood - Sherwood Builders;jdougie;NOT INFORMED;209 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 7.0 hrs on record;TLDR: this would've been a fantastic game 20 years ago.I wanted to love this game, it sounded so promising. My high expectations aside, it is an okay game. The central idea is there, but the execution is lacking. I'm going to keep playing to see it through as far as I can, but whew, it needs help. Still giving it a thumbs up in hopes it improves, and to do that, it needs players. And a lot of money. Pros:+ huge map and interesting terrain+ dynamic weather+ open-quest system (not a prescribed order)+ factions and reputation tied to story line+ survival elements tied to functions (fast travel costs food/thirst or money)Cons:- writing is all over the place. There is some really philosophical and deep stuff one minute, but then VERY obvious typos and misused words/phrases and actors mispronouncing words and names the next- dialogue is flat. you have to press to continue each line, and have no choices in responses- except for the voice of Robin, the voice acting is really bad- combat is boring and repetitive- stealth functionally does not work well. Some enemies spot you miles away, others don't see you stepping on their toes- base building is very limited with pre-determined housing and you can't enter a lot of buildings. They're not actually for a base, they're to craft and upgrade skills, so feels pointless. If you're looking for a base/town builder, this is not the game for you- world does not feel alive. NPCs have no speech animation, you can't sheathe your weapons, so you charge around town waving a giant sword- graphics feel vintage in a bad way, even on the highest settings; 29 February;

Robin Hood - Sherwood Builders;MiAh;NOT INFORMED;62 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 1.5 hrs on record;I'm gonna give this game a thumbs up despite it's many flaws.The game's overall idea is solid. The devs took a chance at introducing a whole heck of a lot of different mechanics and design ideas to really give you a plethora of things to learn, play and experience here. Is the game perfect? No. In fact I'd probably call it perfectly average. Despite all that it does here, it doesn't really do any one particular thing really well. It's all mashed together in a kind of confusing convoluted way and a lot of things end up lacking in the process.Still, if you have a high tolerance for gaming then you'd probably end up really enjoying this game and thinking its super awesome. The biggest problem here is its complex binding of each of these mechanics.The sneaking isn't very good. The archery is awful (Which is mega bad considering your playing as THE Robin Hood.) The base building is restrictive and awkward, the management of inventory and people is awkward. The U.I. is ugly and confusing. The combat is awful as well.But the sound quality is great. The graphics are great. There's a large variety of stuff to do and sink into, it offers so much with a massive map to explore and exploit with a lot of different things you can do. So if gameplay mechanics don't matter much to you just gameplay components then it'd be easy to ignore it's flaws and really enjoy this game.I could go on and on and on but I'd rather not do it here.

Robin Hood - Sherwood Builders;John;NOT INFORMED;69 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 21.0 hrs on record;"Its rare that I review (if you can call this that) a game, unless its pretty awful. Its no AAA and it doesn't pretend to be, the graphics are average at best, but I'll list dislikes and likes not so much PROs and CONs as this stuff is what I care about rather than what makes a poor / good game. Some will be quite petty, so bear with me.DISLIKES- Characters mouths don't move, but their arms/hands sure do. There are many stereotypes about Italians that have nothing on the way the characters ""speak"" in this game. Either that or they're all auditioning to be the next wavey arm inflatable tube guy.- We live in a forest, but maybe 1% of the trees are harvest-able in this survival game. I also spent an hour or two trying to find a very specific tree type. You need your axe handy in order for the harvest-able trees to stand out, so heaven help you if you're ambushed while looking for trees.- How can I get up to that wall, ledge, roof? You might ask... there's a nice ladder right beside you, but that's just scenery. You still have very clear painted marks for any ledge you want to jump on. There's even a section where there are clear and present ladders, but Robin still has to jump for the bright green painted ledge each time. That's another dislike, the ledges needing to be highlighted and underlined, but that's nothing unique to the game.- Weapons degrade pretty quickly, you might have a bow with 100 durability, each shot fired drops 1 durability. This being said, enemies drop weapons when you kill them, but are unusable. Granted some of them are spears and pikes, which Robin wouldn't be seen dead using, but swords and bows are also not lootable/usable. Neither are any weapons from the multitude of weapon racks dotting the landscape. - one mission you're told to take a casket to a specific tomb in a graveyard. Your escortee even has the key. Once you grab the casket, he hands you the key and says to go put it in the tomb. Yet you have to wander the graveyard to find it. Shouldn't the guy with the key know exactly where to send you?- some missions require intercepting treasure carts / prisoner transports. Once mission highlights the cart, zooms in to let me know its there. I go into my inventory to prep for the battle, and all of a sudden cart is gone. Not on map, not in visual range, just gone.- Fella wants to be escorted through enemies to a safe destination, but insists on collecting an item of loot before you leave. Of course he runs ahead without waiting while you scrounge for said item of loot. Speaking of escort quests, if you get 10 steps ahead of them, you get a 10 second countdown to mission failure, regardless of whether the escortee is actually in any danger. No running ahead to kill threats while escortee hangs back. - The Robin Hood story has many variants: Part of the game is about building a village and having his ""men"" build and craft. I spoke to Tuck for a couple of missions during the tutorial, and a misson"; 2 March;

I feel like the only one that isn't is Robin Hood. No one else sounds like an actual person.I'm going to go in more depth since I have the most liked negative review.This game is mediocre in all aspects, but the price point for a mediocre game that ticks the number go up part of my brain is why I was interested in it originally. For others it might be something bad, worse than other titles. For me, I liked the chopping, the mining, and the building management because it's that typical RPG you get resource you get stronger you beat boss and move on. You choose how you want to level up, you have choices (go for 100% reputation, or sell stolen goods for some early cash flow.) It's fine for a game to be mediocre, but if I like it, then why am I so strongly against AI voice acting?AI Voice acting, like AI art, is notorious for stealing sound samples without the creator's permission. I don't care if ""you're different"" or the thing you use ""curates its samples,"" the fact of the matter is the more accepted this becomes, the more companies are going to cut corners by deleting voice actors, artists, and whatever else they can for a quick buck. We've already seen this with sound, where it used to be punchy, responsive, like you actually shot guns, but most guns nowadays sound like a wet fart in the wind.I like the main voice actor. I wish the character's mouths moved, and I wish the game didn't bake my room with how the graphics look but the game requires so much power. I don't like that part of the game is locked off behind bridges, or I have to ""wait"" for the main story quest to catch up to what I want. The point of these open world games is to explore and find stuff, probably become overpowered as a result, and do side quests. The main story is typically a side thing. It's not a bad thing here (I mean it's Robin Hood, they didn't portray him in a bad light.) But when you try to make a game linear when it's open, you sour the taste of people just doing everything they can before finishing the game.I will finish this game since it ticks my boxes, and if I suspect dialogue to be AI generated, spam the skip button. I will never in good faith recommend a game if it has AI generated anything, and will warn others if it does. Also, this game misses some industry staples, like chest having a sort inventory button. This is especially annoying for a game where I need large stacks of resources, they get used up, and then I'll have multiple stacks of 9 when it goes to 50 in my chest."; 3 March;

It just feels like an early acces game.Controls aren't intuitive. It's a lot of boring grinding. Combat just feels clunky and you get a lot of that. Stealth isn't really stealth, because the bow rarely one shots an enemy and then they're all onto you.Some of the events just suck. Just a few minutes ago I had to rescue a person from being executed. I stormed in, killed the executioner then the enemies swarmed me. My sword broke, but luckily I had a backup sword! That rarely does damage. So I run away, got in again, run away got in again. Then I run too far and the mission failed. Even though the executioner was dead already. The enemy archers do tons of damage, if you're lucky to their own comrades, too. But you run out of all you need immediately. Storage system sucks. It's so limited space and costs tons of coin to upgrade.Then there's a lot of dependencies. Want to build this? Gotta get that material first. But you can't get that material, because you don't have the tools with the tier needed. To craft that tool? You got to build another thing first. But for that you need other resources. Same for quests. You want to do a quest? But you need a skill first. For that skill you have to build another building first, again - resource grinding.The game loop is just not fun at all.; 8 March;

A single on-off switch and a double on-off switch.No 3-way or 4-way switches, no latching switches (I suppose they aren't needed with the ""Smart Home DLC""?).The only things you can put into the breaker boxes are Circuit Breakers (specifically 16A, even though you can connect however many appliances after it, so what does it matter how high the rated current is...?) and RCBOs, which are used as the main switch. There are no fuseboxes in this game. I'm gonna say that again... there are no fuses ANYWHERE in this game about being an electrician.Fixing appliances and gadgets in your garage is, as I said before, brainless.Just unscrew and unsolder everything, replace the broken parts, put it all together again.Granted, that's exactly how it works IRL, but there is still no thought required and after a while I just clicked everything until it was done.Look, I'm not asking for a realistic 1:1 representation of what working as an electrician is like, but the game in its current state is just very repetitive and very boring and doesn't even show one tenth of what an electrician actually does.The most positive thing I can say is, that the game has some humor to it.I do have to say though, that they should have kept the more whacky missions for later.I was removing all the lights in a house because a vampire wanted to live in it around mission 4, basically right after the tutorial.Sidenote: It may be because I'm from Germany and the developers are from Poland, but some of the things in this game just rub me the wrong way. I would never use an RCBO as the main switch... ever... but that may just be a ""different coutries, different regulations"" kinda deal.Also sorry if some of the terms in this review are wrong, I only know what they are called in German and had to do some googling to find the English terms."; 23 March;

A Hat in Time;Juan;NOT INFORMED;295 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 28.8 hrs on record;this is one of the prime examples of a succesful kickstarter, i have pre-ordered this game in 2014 and i have no regrets in supporting it for so long.i have played the alpha, beta, speedrunning event, had fun in all of those, though they were only 6 levels of the game.the game as it is right now is a much more upgraded version from the beta (well duh, its released), it features many more interesting mechanics, improved graphics and well, its finished! i definitely wont play through it only once, as it has a special spot in my heart, anticipating a game for so long cant be healthy :Pit is one of the best 3D platformers you can get on steam, if you are an enthusiast for this type of game just get it, and if you are interested in the genre, you will have no regrets.you will smile from pure fun, and actually funny writing! it puts humour where it belongs, and in very precise moments just to get that chuckle out of you.characters are cheerful and memorable, they have great design, atleast i think they do, they look great for the art style the game points torward to, their voice acting is great (you will find exceptions for this, though.), and they are just all around loveable!every chapter is unique and refreshing, you will go from casual platforming to a ????????????? terror game, then back to platforming with cool mechanics.i will not write any further as i still have to play through it myself, but i feel confident on making this review, as feedback has been very positive, and the very limited beta was already very fun! seriously! i played through it for 8 times!the folks at Gears of Breakfast deserve huge props, they come from a modding background (TF2 mods) and are already making this beautiful, fully pledged game, they show talent, and they also show compassion for the modding community, meaning this game will be held alive by the community alone. it is a great pratice that benefits us all as consumers, and seriously, a lot of devs could learn from it.it is expected for a review written at the time of release that me, as the reviewer, have not played through the game, but i just could not handle it, i really want this game to do good. because it IS good.;5 October, 2017;
A Hat in Time;Scooter;548 products in account;232 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 46.6 hrs on record;"I grew up playing games like Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie, Donkey Kong 64, and games like that. Anything with a Rareware logo on it was a guarantee I would like it. The Banjo games especially, I loved. The adventure coupled with the cute characters and mostly wholesome humor always made for a wonderful experience for me.In 2015, when I heard that ex-Rare employees were forming their own company to make a Banjo-Kazooie spiritual successor, Yooka-Laylee, I hopped on board the Kickstarter faster than you could say ""Wahey!"". I threw more money at it than I'm comfortable admitting, because I so badly wanted another game like Banjo. I wanted it to happen, I wanted it to succeed, I wanted it to be the best it could possibly be.For the next two years, I drooled over their Kickstarter page as they provided updates on their progress, new characters, new ideas, level designs, everything. My friends who know me probably wanted me to shut the hell up about this Yooka-Laylee game I keep talking about. ""It's not even out yet, fool. Have some chill."" But there was no chill regarding Yooka-Laylee. The hype, one might say, was real.Finally, in April 2017, after what felt like an eternity of waiting, the game finally released. I was ecstatic. I zoomed home from working that day, took the next day off, and dove into Yooka-Laylee.I enjoyed Yooka-Laylee, just not as much as the Banjo games. I was glad that this kind of game was being attempted again, even if it didn't quite hit all the beats that I wanted it to hit. I wasn't disappointed, but I also don't think it lived up to my expectations. It felt rushed, when a few more months of polish and detail would have done it a lot of good.During 2017, I picked up a Nintendo Switch, and pre-ordered Super Mario Odyssey. I tore through that game, enjoying every minute, exploring every single nook and cranny, collecting all the Power Moons. The capture mechanic is innovative and different. It was much better than Yooka-Laylee, but that's because it's a fully polished first-party Nintendo game. I'd expect nothing less.I've told you this whole story because I want you to understand my full intent and meaning when I say that A Hat in Time is better than Yooka-Laylee and Super Mario Odyssey.I had seen glimpses of A Hat in Time during my two years waiting for Yooka-Laylee. I thought it looked neat, and that maybe I'd check it out after it was released. I didn't want to invest in their post-Kickstarter contribution they had going on their site because I was uncomfortable shelling out more money for a developer I knew nothing about. If I recall correctly, their Kickstarter happened over a year before Yooka-Laylee's did. I didn't hear about it then, but even if I had, I probably wouldn't have backed it.After A Hat in Time released in October, I still wasn't convinced, even though it was $10 cheaper than Yooka-Laylee's list price. I waited for the Steam Winter Sale to pick it up, and finally started actually playing it after Christmas.Once I started playing, I was drawn in completely. A Hat in Time is an utter delight to play. I love it completely. The heart, the charm, the attention to detail, the humor, the music, it's all here. It's exactly what I wanted out of Yooka-Laylee. A Hat in Time is by no means a perfect game. It has its flaws just like everything else. I've encountered a very small number of bugs and goofy behavior, like getting stuck in world geometry then being teleported out of it. There are far fewer MacGuffins to collect in A Hat in Time (40) than in Yooka-Laylee (145) or Super Mario Odyssey (like 800 or whatever), which typically translates to being a shorter game.I thought I would be annoyed by these issues, but I am not. Not one bit. I'm apparently willing to overlook a few minor flaws because the rest of the game is so well done. It's cute as heck, it's funny, it knows what it wants to be. There are only four worlds, and there's roughly only 10 things to do in each world (sometimes fewer). The worlds are big, they're imaginative, they're packed with personality, they're very explorable, and they have a level of detail that shows the love and care that was put into making them. The missions are of varying length and quality, but most are long and involved, and the stories they tell are always delightful in some way or another.And the music, my goodness the music. I'm a huge sucker for video game music, and I love the music in all three of these games. A Hat in Time's music fits in so perfectly and exemplifies the delightful nature of the game.I spent 20 hours getting 100% through A Hat in Time, and by the time I reached the end, I wish I had taken longer. I wish I could wipe my memory of playing it so I could experience it again for the first time.So believe me, a die-hard Rare/Playtonic/Nintendo fan who has played both Yooka-Laylee and Super Mario Odyssey, when I say that A Hat in Time is my 2017 game of the year. Gears for Breakfast has made something special, and I'm looking forward to seeing more from them in the future.";22 January, 2018;
A Hat in Time;Eigan123;1,133 products in account;245 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 64.3 hrs on record;A gaming masterpiece.This is a love letter to video games.In A Hat In Time, the player assumes control of Hat Kid, a (mostly) silent character, on a spaceship, eager to get home. An unexpected snag hits, and off to journey to 3D platforming worlds you go!The story setup is brief but it works. A Hat In Time succeeds because although it advertises itself as cute-as-heck, it’s also fun-as-heck, peck-as-heck, and while there is a time and a place, this is the place. And this place draws you in, because while it’s not the biggest (it’s the first game released by Gears For Breakfast), nor the baddest (a Kickstarter project 4+ years in the making, with a modest budget and a modestly-sized development team), it does exude quality across the board regardless, in many aspects, taking many forms. A Hat In Time’s positives include:+ FUN FACTOR/FUN. Lots and lots of fun! This game GETS IT. From the moment you wake on your spaceship and are placed to inspect your immediate surroundings, this game invites you. At first it is but a whisper. You go over to the dresser, chuckle, a tiny glimpse of the clever writing that awaits you, you then turn your head, and… there is a pool of pillows in your bedroom! Well then, dive in!And that’s what it’s all about.Diving in.A Hat In Time wants you to interact. To explore. To dive in, to soak in its unique blend of personality and charm. Here’s your ticket, all aboard, passenger! You’re invited to this vibrant, crazy train! Nostalgic and trailblazing, A Hat In Time pays respect to the old and the new. The little things. The big things. This world is alive, full of details, both large and small, some random, some not, from Roomba rides, to scooter horns, to pattycake with the man in blue, to random posters plastered in various worlds, to talking owls, to curious crows, to picture taking, to jokes, to jokes WITHIN jokes, to clever responses, to humorous interactions, to easter eggs, to random jumps on floating cookies, to scary ledges, to tightrope mechanics, to engrossing music, to the vibrant surroundings and atmosphere, the list goes on. Which all amounts to --Fun. A BIG bundle of fun! The game doesn’t have to tell you to HAVE fun, because the world IS fun. The worlds are a playground for Hat Kid, she herself a world of her own, able to convey, through facial expressions and body animations alike, a wide range of emotions such as joy, sadness, or her unmistakenly unwavering child-like innocence, sarcasm, and hope. Hat Kid’s adorable idle animations, her 'running-in-place’ animation, environmentally specific animations (keep a lookout during cold/mysterious/scary areas), cute voicelines (Her “Bye” to the Badge Seller awww <3), her “Fireballs,” her “Boo-yahs,” and so on and so forth, as well as her dedicated buttons to ‘blow kiss/smooch’ and ‘raspberry’, all come together to make her a ball of recklessly positive inspiration, ready to take on any adventure that comes her way.+ CONTROLS. This is tight, responsive platforming paradise. Controls are crisp, enabling Hat Kid to move well to your desire. Her moveset includes running, a standard jump, a double jump, a long jump, a parkour-inspired wall jump, a dive, an air dive, a dive cancel, an air dive cancel, umbrella swipes, air homing attacks, etc. not to mention equippable hats and badges that add various skills and abilities to her arsenal. It seems like a basic layout, and it may appear so on the surface, but her runs, jumps, dives, and cancels provide a level of precision and a gateway for advanced play that allows for mid-air error adjustment, correction, and control, allowing her to maneuver platforms with relative ease. Her toolbox further rewards skillful players who are able to chain these abilities together to make use of speedruns, which are an embraced option in the game. A Hat In Time even goes as far as to include a speedrun timer in the options, for those willing to take on the challenge of going fast, fast, fast!And because Hat Kid controls quite well, particularly resourceful players will be able to discover shortcuts and different ways to finish a stage. This is a mark of a good control scheme, as well as well-planned, well thought-out, and well-executed level design.+ GENRE-BREAKING ELEMENTS. In a manor of speaking, this game surprises as it transcends its predominant 3D platformer roots and manages to mix genres such as stealth, mystery, and horror into one. I will be brief here because these sections are best experienced by the player itself, but will say that these sections make sense for each specific adventure, and are appropriate for each specific setting. It executes this wonderfully and it comes through beautifully. It does not feel tacked on, or existing just because it can, but is rather interesting and highlight some of the best and most memorable parts of the game.+ SOUNDTRACK. Clocking in at over 5 hours, A Hat In Time’s soundtrack, almost all of which are composed by Pascal Michael Stiefel, along with a few other notable names (Grant Kirkhope + artists with remixed renditions of specific tracks), is genuinely one of the best parts of A Hat In Time AND (IMO) one of THE MAIN reasons to get the game. One of the most important elements for game immersion, A Hat In Time’s soundtrack is excellent, with memorable, catchy, and ambitious sections, spanning across different genres to create a defining mark and a long-lasting impression. Mindful players will recognize nostalgic sections/references amongst specific tunes (but it’s not a prerequisite, as the soundtrack, as a whole, is fantastic enough to listen to as a standalone, without the coat of nostalgia to cast judgment).Simply put, this soundtrack is one to hold in high regard, in and outside of the game. I do (and will) play stages JUST to hear certain tracks, they’re that good, and such a joy to listen to! The variety here is astounding, likely offering something to suit the tastes of everyone.+ OPEN-ENDED DESIGN. The game supports Steam Workshop, which means that it encourages mods/mod support (currently in beta). Options exist for new dyes/costumes, new hats, new abilities, unique levels, recreations of stages from beloved games, added difficulties, and so on and so forth. Intriguing possibilities abound, and we’re just at the tip of the iceberg.+ HUMOR. A good chunk of the game’s personality and charm can be attributed to the humor and strong writing, clearly inspired by beloved games of old. Most of the humor here is appropriate for kids, although some border on the twisted and the macabre.Whether it’s Hat Kid’s mannerisms, her interactions with objects/characters, the characters themselves, or a specific activity within a specific stage, A Hat In Time puts a nostalgic, yet distinct style to accompany and enhance these specific worlds, never artificial, and as wacky as the wacky worlds that they are set within. It just… fits. It’s ok to smile, and to laugh along :).As far as negatives go, world 5’s main antagonist needs more screen time, more backstory, more motivation to emphasize why this character set out to become the very character this is in the final act. More fleshing out in this aspect is needed. as is, it ended up being too abrupt.---FINAL THOUGHTS---The game, per Kickstarter achieved stretch goals, will have worlds 6 and 7 arriving as free DLCs, and will have co-op modes available in the near future. There is much to look forward to!Get this game and transport yourself to an amazing, memorable journey. Support a development team that put obvious love and care into their work! The charm, the precision, the detail – this is a fine example of gaming bliss. One that should endure – in time.My wish is that Hat Kid becomes recognizable enough to the point that she becomes a classic, iconic, beloved video game character.A Hat In Time cherishes the past, shapes the present, and has a promising future.Play it. Be charmed by it. Enjoy it.Love it!;26 November, 2017;

Mr. Prepper;NeZ;NOT INFORMED;67 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 27.6 hrs on record;"Mr. Prepper. A survival base building game that's not about survival and not about base building but purely story-driven.TL.DR: If you can get it cheap (10 USD/EUR), give it a shot. But if you want a survival challenge or expect another game like This War Of Mine, STAY AWAY. It has SO much unused potential. It could be so much more.PROS:+ Interesting story. Mr. Prepper is not your average guy.+ The typical ""just one more day"" game design that sucks you in.+ 3 (4) NPCs you interact with that are all kinda likable.+ Amazing puns and great humor. Lots of cringe too, but overall pleasant.+ Graphics are on point, good music.CONS:- Unresponsive controls. Never click on the wrong floor - Mr. Prepper doesn't know how to stop midway on a ladder.- HORRIBLE melee combat system. Clunky and unresponsive plus weird camera movement makes for an awful experience.- The story is 100% linear and overall it's way too story driven too. There are sidequests... but they ALL lead to the same final quest step. You can't proceed with most sidequests until you've done other sidequests first. Why have 5 sidequests at once if I can only do them one at a time?!- You can optimize your bunker. But you don't need to. There's no endgame. At the end of my 100% playthrough I had 3000 coins and 100 of every resource. Turns out you don't need all that. I shot for the moon and grinded WAY too much.- Water? Easy. Just place 15 buckets in your backyard and a water tank in your bunker. The water from the rain magically teleports from the buckets into your water tank.- Food? Easy. Just place 10 plant pots with guaranas. They can be crafted into energy drinks, eaten directly for 4 units of food and can be sold for 1 coin each. Guarana. You get seeds early, the plants are infinite and you can use them for everything. I never thought I'd say this but Guarana berries are OP.- Money? Easy. Just spam plant pots with corn & sunflowers, spam traps in the forest and leave the machines in the mine running all day every day. Often you will have more flowers / gold / fur that you can sell. If you still need more money, just craft kettles, pans and tables to sell.- Resources? Easy. Just use the money to buy PCs, crates, etc. and disassemble them. That's also the ONLY way to get plastic, electronic parts and textile. Why is there no way to farm / produce / harvest those 4 important resources? Why do I HAVE to trade for them?- Trading? Easy. It's exploitable as ????. Buy sugar for 7 coins, sell it for 8 coins, all while increasing your trust for BOTH sellers? Sure. Use the money to buy books and resources.- As you can see, the game is too grindy. And still it's too easy to optimize the ???? out of it.- Some weird mechanics and inconsistencies. The water from the buckets teleports into the water tank but not into the irrigators for some dumb reason, so true automation is impossible.- Weird mini games. Why is the car driving a ???? sidescrolling quick time event? Really?- There's random levels in the forest, in the mine and random stages in the desert... but they're all useless. Once you get access to them, you already have all you need to finish the game.- Grenades and especially dynamite is WAY too strong. You can craft grenades with salt + stone (!), just spam them during fights and you're set. And in case you do need HP... just eat some guarana berries.- There are 2 ranged weapons in the game and both are useless. You get the pistol kinda early but can't really use it because you lack money to buy ammo and you get the rifle way too late to really use it for anything.- Boss fights. Yep. BOSS FIGHTS. In a 2D side scrolling survival game. Most fights are just ""kill 10 enemies that approach you in hordes"".- Finally, there's the last level in the game. In a game where you ""prepare for the worst"", you find out you can't bring in resources you prepared. Instead, the last level has a dumb puzzle that makes you feel stupid. And then there's the final boss fight and that one takes the cake. It's easily the dumbest boss fight I have ever played. In a game with non-responsive controls, you need to avoid falling rocks to ""kill"" the boss. UGH.";20 April, 2021;

Endzone - A World Apart;school,;NOT INFORMED;539 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 13.8 hrs on record;"Endzones mechanical mix is rather simplistic in terms of a city builder. There isnt much to plan around, not much to care about.However, its mix also provides a solid post-apocalyptic survival experience.The city building is good, not exceptional, not bad, its simple but good.The graphics are actually one of its biggest pro points. The world looks authentic, vegetation, lighting, textures, animations are all up to date and well done.Visually its a nice looking game. Again, nothing revolutionary, but for a game of that scale its delivering.The survival aspects remain standard. You have to get water, food, body protection (clothing) and healing products (herbalism).Nothing overly fancy here that hasnt been done or be provided by any other city building game or survival game.The only minor excourse here is radiation. You have to take care of the ground, of water pollution etc.While being minor, the implementation of radiation causes several sideeffects on the gameplay that make it more complex and introduces more decision making when placing buildings or planning your supplies.You cant just build a fisherhut and be done with it. Later events might cause radiation to contaminate the fish in the water, the fisher gets it to your supplies, it contaminates further and then is being eaten by the people so they become sick.Since its food, obviously they also become sick although they have bodyprotection.When they become sick, they can become unable to reproduce so your colony just dies slowly.Its kind of funny to have a colony of old people, but its obviously not going anywhere.Dramatic when the last one is the one having burried all his or her friends but not getting burried him/herself.Further on to the society mechanics. You have your typical demographics with their own problems.As mentioned Old people cant get children and arent the best workforce, children arent helpful at all and their parents are the only reliable workforce you have.All want something.Children ""want""";18 March, 2021;

Endzone - A World Apart;The;NOT INFORMED;265 people found this review helpful18 people found this review funny; Recommended 36.4 hrs on record;Tutorial took 2.5 hours to complete, so there goes my refund windowit's not bad. it has the depth of Banished and a lot of the same mechanics, and it has the pirates (called raiders) from Tropico 6 to come and randomly attack you, but you can bribe them away too. And it has Frostpunk's weather system, except with radiation instead of freezing. The difficulty is somewhere between all 3 of those games, not being as unforgiving as Frostpunk, but not as relaxing as Tropico.If you like building sims, then you'll probably like this, but it doesn't exactly do anything new besides the radiation mechanics. It's kind of a frankenstein of different builder/strategy games, which might be good or bad, depending on how much you like those games and whether you feel like you need more.Personally, I thought the setting of Banished was really boring, and the visuals too drab. This is a nice replacement if you prefer a settlement that has electricity and scrap collectors. If that sounds like you're kind of thing, then go ahead and get this (on sale, though the full price is pretty reasonable.) But it's not an absolute must buy for every single person. For example....I did see another review making some complaints about the setting. namely, that it wasnt exactly Fallout.Look, I love those games, BUT DONT come into this expecting an RPG with super mutants and zombies. There are other games (which are unfortunately more similar to tower-defense games) for that kind of thing, and of course you can go play Fallout Shelter if you want to build a vault. This is not a cartoon version of the apocalypse, but something closer to a realistic challenge. Combat is not the focus, and exploring ruins is a side project to the main feature: building a functioning settlement.;18 March, 2021;

I had to continually pay tribute to the raiders, which is fine, but the tributes kept getting higher and higher. I can see if the same raider came back over and over that they would increase the tribute price, but it never was the same raider twice. The last time a raider came I literally could not afford to pay them. They wanted ALL of my food, ALL of my water, and MOST of my radiation suits. Now I had a militia trained, and towers along the entire perimeter of my city, all stocked with ammo and fully garrisoned. The raiders walk right on by like they weren't even there. The towers just exploded instantly. And you can't build towers next to each other as it decreases their effectiveness. How is ONE tower better than TWO? How does having MORE FIREPOWER MAKE THEM WORSE!? Also, as far as militia goes, why can't I control them like an army? Why would any competent leader let only 4 militiamen fight at a time instead of all 150!? The towers in other parts of the city did nothing, just stood by and watched as they rampaged through the northern part of the city! Needless to say it was a game ender.

The frustrating part is that it has a neat concept, but it wastes a lot of its potential with a host of issues. In no particular order:Quests aren't well designed, in several ways. Let's talk about three of them:1.) First, the difficulty is completely unbalanced. Quests tend to fall into the two categories ""so hard it's almost impossible / not worth the effort so it's better to just ignore it"" or ""so easy you have to do nothing at all to complete them"".2.) The other thing about quests is that they often ask you to play worse. Say, you need to produce worse tools or protective equipment because higher tier equipment doesn't count toward the quest progress (which sets you up to forgetting to set them back so you continue producing the worse items). Or there are quests who ask you to disable the coal filters on your water towers, which means people will drink radioactive water if you forget to set it back again. It's like the game is actively trying to trip you up.3.) A lot of quests also ask you to stockpile a certain amount of resources - it doesn't matter if you have heaps of the materials in storage and you also produce plenty. The quests always ask for more than you have stored right now, so if you've set some already very high limits already, you still have to continue to increase them. This doesn't just feel extremely unnecessary and counter to the spirit of these quests (i already have plenty of the materials! why do you ask for more!) it's a lot of micromanagement with the limits for no good reason, which also just makes you start to ignore the quests.Together, quests are frustrating, annoying and actively ask you to play worse a lot of the time and later i just ignored them because playing is more fun that way (luckily the fail consequences aren't that dramatic that you can relatively easily afford that, on normal difficulty at least). All the issues are also made worse with how the game often hits you with a whole number of quests at once, because one of their intented goals is to serve as a comeback mechanic - say, you run out of tools, so you'll get a quest to produce more and you'll get a bunch as a bonus. Which sounds good in theory, but also it means that when things go wrong in your settlement, you'll be running out of a lot of things at once, and you'll be bombarded with quests for all of them. Being smarter about recognizing when you already have some active quests would be nice. Bonus points for having a comeback mechanic with these quests though. it's a good idea.One of my main gripes with the game though is lack of access to information. Okay, this upgraded version of a building is more efficient - by how much? The game rarely ever gives you numbers, or explains in enough depth how something works to allow you to actually make plans. It's a lot of guesswork and trial and error, and contributes to a very loose feedback loop to the point where it can feel like nothing you do matters in any way and what happens is random because you don't know what the effects of your actions are even supposed to be. Sometimes you'll also just run out of food and water, and you have no idea why, you didn't change anything and there was no big drought.The overall game difficulty is also badly designed. There will be a huge difficulty spike in the early to mid game. If you've played other games in the city builder genre like Banished, you'll know the problem of getting tools and clothing up in time, and if you fail you're in for a spiral. Together with other mechanics that improve the efficiency of basically everything, it felt worse in this game though. Even normal difficulty felt pretty brutal and was extremely stressful early on, but once you're over that hurdle there's nothing to be afraid of any more.One issue that plagues this whole genre: job micromanagement. You'll have to spend A LOT of time just managing jobs to adjust for population changes. I really want to see a game that doesn't force me to always keep hovering at 1 - 2 free workers to avoid losing my carefully adjusted worker distribution without wasting workers because if someone dies with 0 free settlers and someone dies they won't be replaced. Having some way to assign percentages to certain jobs could maybe help with that.Some other, smaller problems:Having to manually wire up electricity feels pointless and is a huge chore. You just want to power everything once you unlock electricity anyway, and placing powerpoles is really annoying. Why can't mines connect to a pole on the road tiles in front of them? Please just make the connection point in the middle, also for the refinery. And why don't wind turbines connect to each other if you place them at their closest distance without reducing efficiency? That would be such a good QoL feature.The UI is also pretty bad and clunky in places. Managing lategame is really frustrating in particular with no ability to quickly assign large amounts of people to jobs (other than all), trader UI is an example for unintuitive design (why aren't the positions for equalize deal and accept deal swapped? would be much more intuitive), i could go on.Performance will also be your main limitation for how big your settlement can become. At around 2000 population, it gets really noticeably slow.There are honestly so many more other issues i've had, but these are some of the main ones at least. Generally, the quality of the game is also pretty inconsistent. Some aspects are pretty polished (love the trader interactions and voicelines!), and in other places the game is just really clunky.To name some more positives:As a fan of postapocalyptic settings and city builders, i really enjoyed the core idea of the game and how brutal the game can be, even though it often feels unfair or random, does fit the atmosphere.I also started enjoying the game a lot more once i started playing the scenarios. Usually, i prefer freeplay modes in games, but in this game that just kinda emphasizes a number of issues the game has especially in lategame. Not all of them were great, but i can say i had fun playing them and 100%ing the game.The comeback mechanics with the quests definitel were a nice touch.Overall, it feels like an early access title. You can still have fun with it, and if you're a fan of the genre and can overlook a bunch of issues then it might be worth a look. But definitely expect to have to wrestle with the game in a number of places, it's far from a polished experience and it sadly wastes a lot of its potential.";15 May, 2022;
Endzone - A World Apart;Nikolaz;NOT INFORMED;200 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 5.1 hrs on record;Keep in mind the game is in early access so these things are subject to change. I watched a youtube video in which the (p?)reviewer had the impression that this game would have something to do with rebuilding society, utilizing ruins and so on, everything I've dreamed of in a city builder since forever. The game goes for and will go for, by the looks of things right now, an entirely different route. You are survivors most certainly and you will build, but you will also fail. Yes, there is in fact no doubt about it, there isn't as of right now and I do not believe this will change, any way for your settlement to become sustainable, it is less 'rebuild' more a sort of arcade-like increasingly difficult survival effort limited by a soft cap and a hard cap on how long your survival effort can last.The soft cap is the weather and radiation, despite your survivors emerging on the surface to what is supposed to be improving conditions they actually start out mild and will get increasingly bad, initially you will have uncontaminated rain or weakly contaminated rain. Once you make it past the 100 season mark those are rare, replaced with drought and highly irradiated rains and sandstorms, this is what I refer to when I call the game an 'arcade' because unlike Banished in which the difficulty can be explained within the confines of the setting here it cannot, there is little rhyme or reason in the radiation actually getting worse the more generations go by as you move further away from when the catastrophy that caused the apocalypse took place. The hard cap is resources, some like food and wood and water are renewable, however scavenged materials are (for obvious reasons) finite, once they run out your settlements final days will be approaching, if you can survive constant drought/sandstorm/high radiation with the equipment salvaging provides you, you cannot survive them without it. Any review is subjective but what I was looking for and the impression I was given from the previews is a world in which you and your survivors intend to rebuild society, restore the ruins and bring back humanity from the brink. What the game offers is the ability to tear down what remains of the old world until there is nothing more to remove, whereupon your settlement dies.;10 April, 2020;
Endzone - A World Apart;Trmotta;NOT INFORMED;142 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 25.1 hrs on record;After playing for 25 hours, I can safely say this game didn't bring me joy. Instead it gave me anger, frustration, stress, a small agitation as I wanted to start over and quickly reach an advanced point in-game and finally it made me just not care anymore.You see, this is a player vs environment kind of game, but one which doesn't make you feel proud of advancing through the days and overcoming the hardships of a post nuclear chaos. It just makes you feel that you will be penalized no matter what. In fact, you get beaten ever so constantly that at some point it just doesn't matter anymore, for you have learned that these penalties won't add up on the long run, as, no matter what, you can always recover, time is never really a problem and there are always enough resources or people available.The UI and visual queues needs a throughout recreation. It's pretty hard to understand what is going on. Why is my villager going through such lengths to get something that is available right by his side? It's during the day, I have all the materials, why is my production stopped? I would be so glad to have a way to quickly gaze and find out more about this and if there are enough water/food/storage near my production buildings, but I don't think there is such a feature. Instead I have to click on specific individuals and watch as they run from one point of the town to another without a clue of what they are doing.Even the technology tree feels kinda pointless. You go straight from manpower to electricity, which costs nothing to maintain, runs forever and doesn't seem to make production that much better.With so much going on, you would expect the environment to become ever so challenging or rewarding, but instead its just the same penalties happening over and over again, no twist, no new effect, just the same thing. Raiders? Yeah, they will demand resources from you and their value keeps increasing. But it doesn't matter as you can always pay them off, even if it costs all your 20k water/food.Without feeling proud for my achievements, not caring at all for the presented characters or what they have endured, not feeling immersed, and with mechanics that don't really add depth to the game, this was clearly a big NO for me.;19 April, 2021;

A Total War Saga: TROY;cbanks;NOT INFORMED;379 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 463.8 hrs on record;"TW has a fundamental problem: The AI hasn't really evolved. That was fine 20 years ago when I played my first TW game, Medieval. In 2022 it's pathetic and, in fact, TW: Troy is less of a strategy war game than 20 years ago. Creative Assembly's solution for this is to make the game harder (and less realistic) but not more challenging. Huh? Challenging to me would be a game of TW RTS chess. To make it harder TW just piles on enemy factions, cheats against players, NPC buffs, etc. The game starts off promising. The factions are well thought out and differentiated. On paper they have well defined strategic differences and play styles. Ditto factional units (more on that later). Regardless of mode, classic, semi-mythical, or mythical, it starts of with well designed, if largely recycled, cuts scenes laying out your faction's situation and starting strategy. Once in game you have 2 victory conditions: Homer or TW. Additionally you have epic missions (usually 13 needed for a Homer victory) and regular missions that offer rewards, often too meager for the trouble, that early on act as a tutorial to get you started. Later regular missions make little strategic sense to me and are just inviting endless wars in distant regions to gobble up historic areas. Each region has a settlement with a fort and typically 2 settlements with resources. Resource settlements can't be walled. It's all downhill from there. Fairly early on you'll be given a mission to control 4 regions (nomad factions are a bit different). About the time you complete it all strategy ends and TW: Troy becomes a game of whack-a-mole. Inevitably you'll be tagged a threat, assigned an antagonist faction you can't negotiate with that will compel countless factions to brainlessly declare war and swarm you. I've played 100s of hours and at this point in every game strategy, goals, objectives, plans all cease for pretty much the entire game as I'm in reactionary mode responding to endless invasions outnumbered anywhere from 3:1 to 8:1. Yes, it's a war game but this gets extremely tedious very quickly because no progress is being made except exhausting NPCs.It's not too long into the game I just want to auto-resolve many battles because most aren't very interesting. But you can't because, as expected, auto-resolve is so heavily nerfed TW forces you to manually fight all but trivial conflicts. Manual combat isn't even as good as old TW: Medieval, IMHO. The first problem is the unit selection isn't very diverse. Calvary is very limited and most of that is skirmish. The 2 mythical game modes are a little better offering cavalry like centaurs and even some flying units like griffins. But there still isn't enough variety. Resources are tight plus there are limits on many elite units so mostly it's about fielding as many mediocre armies as you can. I find it hard to get past 2-3 full (20 units) armies until the mid to later stages - about the time I'm bored and about to stop. I should add here most factions have an administrative burden nerf so the more armies you add the more they cost to buy and maintain. Ditto adding/upgrading settlements. Siege equipment is pitiful. Ladders and battering rams. That's it unless you go through a very long buff cycle to develop a ""Trojan horse"". I was so eager to develop one only to find it isn't what I hoped for. It's just a recycled siege tower from TW: Rome, et al. The walled city layouts aren't very interesting and battles are just slow hack and slash. If you ladder up a wall you're stuck on the wall until you pretty much control the gate and by then the battle is almost over anyway. Battering rams often get slaughtered before they do their work. Unwalled resource settlements are contrived geographic locations with typically 3 canyon choke points. Again, hack and slash. Few tactics.Open field battle (sea battles are resolved in open field too) doesn't offer many tactical opportunities either. The big thing pushed in TW: Troy is flanking but it's harder than you'd expect to maneuver units. Units are stupid and often non-compliant to your orders. They require constant monitoring. The game always assigns the player a disadvantageous starting position like lower ground. Terrain doesn't simulate reality (I've been to Greece) and is contrived with obstacles and lots of trees and hills because TW likes hidden units. The problem with hidden units is their visibility comes and goes so units can't lock onto the enemy and will just stand around awaiting further orders - that constant monitoring problem. Missile units in brush or trees won't fire and often won't easily leave cover with enemies near. Also, all units slow to a crawl in brush or trees and they aren't quick to start with. Beyond these issues the AI doesn't follow orders very well. Units tend to get hung up on their way even on clear terrain frustrating any flanking or rear action plans (like harassing NPC missile units). I'm not a big fan of the superhero army leader idea either in the 2 mythical modes but it's the price you pay for an expanded unit roster. Classic offers traditional leader units.One quick thing. TW: Troy discourages army garrisoning. Settlements can be reasonably garrisoned through settlement upgrades to a degree but if you add an army due to a larger threat it won't be long before your hero is penalized for laziness and procrastination. I'll add the hero buffs and penalties in this game are numerous to the point of confusion.Diplomacy is mostly a joke. It is most helpful in barter trading. The AI will always brainlessly make a trade if they're not at war with you. Otherwise, it is pretty resistant - and awful. NPCs will arbitrarily declare war on you and if you look up the reason it's because they're at war with you. Silly. Often in a turn or two you can make peace with them and they will pay you for it! Huh? Only for this silly cycle to repeat itself with the same NPC a few turns later. Mostly you can't negotiate with anyone beyond non-aggression except when your faction is part of a larger shared culture like the Danaans. Then you can form defensive or military alliances with cultural peers but they are only useful to the extent they won't attack you while they're in them and might pose a target for your enemies. They won't help you fight and will betray you without penalty. You break an alliance and it's a huge diplomatic penalty leading to almost every faction in the game wanting to fight you plus barter earns a huge cost penalty. Vassals and confederations are an option in rare instances but I find it best to avoid them. Wrapping up game play there are agents: priestess, spy and diplomat. They're not as useful as I hoped and just as NPCs swarm me with armies they swarm me with agents who typically kill/wound my agents over and over and over. In the mythical mode there are also mythical agents that infrequently auto-generate but they only last 8 turns. The turn limit renders them mostly useless in my experience. The bottom line is I find the early game play fun and can typically last 80-100 turns until I'm sick of the whack-a-mole. Playing 100 more turns to get into an end game isn't worth it so I rarely try and only forced myself to gut out a win once in a little under 300 moves just to say I did. By then I had overwhelming power and finally could strategically choose to declare war. Unfortunately it was on leftover minor NPCs until I reached an unrewarding TW victory. A Homer one would have even taken longer in that particular game.";10 March, 2022;
A Total War Saga: TROY;John;NOT INFORMED;215 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 355.3 hrs on record;"I'm re-writing this review because having spent over 333 hours in the game at time of writing, my opinion of the game has worsened. Let's get somethings out of the way before we begin. First, do not be fooled by the name, this is no Saga, this is a full Total War game that's had its content chopped up, cut out, and placed behind the paywall as DLC. Things as simple as blood you now have to pay for. The factions, the maps, are all there, they're simply inaccessible unless you pay more money. They even made blood a DLC. The greed is palpable and should not be rewarded.The second question is whether there is fun to be had in this game? Absolutely yes, this can provide some of the best entertainment in Total War history, because it has hands down the best battle maps. They have a good mixture of terrain types, ranging from plains for chariots to roar across, to woods to hid lightly armoured flanking units, to elevated terrain for Archers or Slingers to rain down fire on the enemy, with plenty of choke points for spear infantry to hold the line. Giant statues and sea monsters litter the background providing a scale as yet unseen in TW. Heroes sling insults at each other, goading the other on then ridiculing their opponent if they run away. The campaign map is also beautiful with some delightful animations of both wildlife and mythical gods and monsters. The game now has five resources - Food, Gold, Bronze, Wood, and Stone - all used in construction and/or recruitment.So whilst this is a fun game, the problem it has, the reason it's so difficult to recommend is because that fun is buried under a mountain of poor design decisions. Since Rome 2 hit the shelves, Turns have taken an age but this game takes that to a whole new level. At its shortest, with no interruptions, and on its fastest setting, a turn still takes around one minute to complete, longer in the end-game because of the sheer number of enemy agents that need to be moved. Add to that the incessant begging of the AI for 2/3 of resources you have, every single turn, and if you play as one of the Trojan factions, by the end of the mid-game you can expect the entire map to start declaring war on you each turn. This stretches turns out into an infinity that require active participation removing the possibility to tab out and go do something else. The game also has a propensity for spinning the camera around wildly when you have an army or settlement attacked, making it very difficult to keep track of where the attack is taking place on what is a rather large map, especially in the late game when your territory has expanded considerably through a mechanic called ""Confederation"" which is basically a way of conquering nations through peace.A typical turn will involve half the map contacting you and begging you to trade resources that you can ill afford to trade because you need them to build the higher end units (besides the fact, why would I sell you iron to make the sword that will kill me?). A typical turn in the early late-game involves the entire map either begging you for resources, or declaring war on you and/or conducting sneak attacks on your unprotected settlements, where upon the camera will swing around like its tied to a rope and being swung around someone's head, and after three minutes of this, you've had half a dozen settlements ransacked, another two or three wars, only to be spammed with an insane number of pop ups most of which contain entirely unnecessary information, leaving you so frustrated that you end up quitting the game.There are also a lot of short cuts been taken with the design because the unit roster is poor. Most factions use variations of club infantry which are all the same unit, albeit with a new skin. Slingers are better in melee than most swordsman, and can out range and out damage Archers in ranged combat. There is also a disingenuous limit on how many units can be recruited at the beginning of the game, with an army total numbering 20 but only 3 units per turn being able to be recruited, 4 if you spend food and ask Ares for help. Similarly there is no upgrade option, you have to disband a unit and recruit a new one which will be at the same rank but it all adds an unnecessary level of micromanagement. Late game is 6 per turn but it still means an army requires anywhere from 7 to 3 turns to build/upgrade. Similarly, on the battle map, units will stop attacking and stand around being murdered by ranged units if the unit you told them to attack routs. They won't follow, they won't engage the next nearest, again requiring you to micromanage the battle.So do I recommend the game? Only if you can pick it and it's DLC up in a cut down sale price. Between the greed and the poor design, a game that should have been the pinnacle of the Total War series is simply not worth your money nor your time at the premium price they're charging for it. Frankly Total War, and Creative Assembly have been going down hill since the Sega take over, and this game simply epitomises the decline of a once great series.";1 December, 2021;
A Total War Saga: TROY;are;NOT INFORMED;492 people found this review helpful29 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 92.5 hrs on record;Troy is plagued with more than a few issues that have existed for a long time in the Total War series:- Dumb, rabid AI that will target your undefended settlements with no concept of self preservation. You could be sieging the gates of Troy and on the verge of stealing back Helen but Paris' AI will be far more interested in playing whack-a-mole with one of your armies over some of your undefended settlements in the middle of bum ???? nowhere. This issue is particularly highlighted during the late campaign, with the AI abusing the Aegean with the full speed stance looking to wriggle past your armies for those oh so tasty undefended settlements.- Siege battles are still broken with extremely over-powered settlement defence towers and piss poor unit pathing. This issue is exacerbated by the condensed nature of the world map with many settlements being one turn away from each other.- The resource system means the AI spams diplomacy even more. AI can be overly aggressive and abuse diplomacy to get at the player - such as some of the major players forming military alliances with a 3rd world one settlement faction in the corner of the map which then declares war on the player for absolutely no conceivable reason, bringing in half the map to fight you alone.- Units wipe each other out so quickly that battles are reduced to how fast you can click spam fest- You're essentially penalised for trying to build decent settlement garrisons against aforementioned dumb, rabid AI. In the case of this Total War game, garrisons should have been tied to the main settlement building with a basic garrison with the chance to expand it at a discounted rate towards your administration tier and treasury imo . How it works in Troy is that you really need every settlement slot for resources, special mythical buildings etc and the garrison debuff of minus public order is also daft. - Great power penalty is ??????? dumb - at the very least this should have been tied to the administration tiers and not be implemented so harshly.- The administration tiers in general are under utilised and could have been made so much more interesting with the aforementioned points, instead of CA trying to make the game more difficult for the sake of it.- The difficulty levels tying together AI stat buffs and supposed increased AI intelligence - an asinine decision to say the leastNow for some of the positives:- I absolutely love the Mythos world map with so many interesting features and places to look at. The sea is beautiful and the day/night cycle with all the settlements lit up at night is the cherry on top. I also like the background imagery and how the fog of war 'burns away' when you discover new areas.- I think the mythical creatures are fantastic and have been implemented and balanced really well. They fit into the world and look amazing, the fact they are tied to different settlements around the map via special buildings is great, encouraging the player to explore and expand.- The administration tier system works really well here, it encourages the player to explore different unit compositions and recruit units that they might not usually go for. On a side note, in other TW games such as Total War Warhammer they should do away with the ?????? supply lines system altogether and let the player go nuts.- I think the special recruitment pool is a very cool idea, allowing the player to get hold of special units that they wouldn't get otherwise. Unfortunately, the events and other ways to fill this pool are extremely sparse when it should function a bit more frequently and consistently like with the events tied with the Lizard men's blessed units in WH2.- The Expeditions are a fun and interesting feature that allows the player to put together a team and guide them through a mini text adventure game in order to gain a special gargantuan monster unit as well as new units and mechanics which I think are great.Overall I really like the concept of this game, with two major uber factions in the form of the Danaan Pillar and Trojan Pillar clashing across the Aegean. It's just a shame that as you progress through the campaign things like the ??????, dumb, overly-aggressive AI can ruin this by creating bizarre, annoying and frustrating situations that pull you right out of the experience amongst other neglected areas of the game which gradually start to wear you down. I very much enjoyed the beginning of the campaign in this game, but as I reach the later game it starts to get more and more tedious. CA seems to have this obsession with making it's games more difficult for the sake of it as apposed to making it's games interesting. Although it has got admittedly better over the years there are still issues with some of the difficult for difficulties sake mentality and game design choices. As much as I would like to recommend this game for all the good points, I can't.EDIT:I'm trying to stick it out to at least complete a campaign, but the more I play Troy, the more annoying anti-player mechanics I keep finding:- The chronic issue of random neutral/friendly factions declaring war on the player seems to be tied to player progress. If the game decides that the player is 'doing too well' it will quite literally keep dog piling you with factions to fight from every direction until you start going backwards. Which is ironic because it feels like the AI itself has gone backwards. I have done a bit of testing through saving and reloading and it seems some factions will be absolutely hard set on declaring war on you no matter what agreements you make with them. The close proximity of a lot of the settlements on the world map means that if this particular anti-player mechanic kicks in, chances are there will be more than a few occasions in which an enemy stack will instantly take a settlement without warning or without you being able to defend yourself. Nice.- Now that agents can't be used in battle or attached to armies more meaningfully like in Warhammer, the problem of AI agent spam has come back in full force. Have fun watching a dozen or so enemy agents pinball between your settlements and armies every turn.-;5 September, 2021;

For every plus this game has it has an equal negative quality.

I also found the Mythos DLC pretty fun, but that's extra cost to play, so keep that in mind.And the negatives, The big one is a complete failure to recreate the Trojan war. CA, in a bid to make the game more open ended, doesn't have a lot of alliances or pacts at the start of the game, and thus, in all my play time, I have never once seen Troy, Paris and Hector, at war with all of the factions they are supposed to be at war with. How irritating is that? And worst of all, the AI will almost never join a war against one of the main factions, so you can't even work around it. And because of the ""Join War"" BS, the AI will constantly join the war against just you, avoiding any allies you have. Basically the entire diplomacy system is ?????? up beyond repair. Also, the usual anti-player bias is back. AI will focus on you to the exclusion of rational choices most of the time. AI behind your line, hitting a settlement, then forced marching away from all your armies is back (never left without modders, I never understand how CA keeps messing this one up).To sum up, I hope they take the good from this and more forward, but the diplomacy system is so broken it's hard to find the fun in the campaign even though individual battles are pretty fun.

A Total War Saga: TROY;FieteH;NOT INFORMED;182 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 50.7 hrs on record;As much as I have played this game to DEATH ever since it came out, that has mostly to do with Total War games being very good at hitting my addiction brain. When it comes to being a good game, though, TROY is a mixed bag...While I did not like Three Kingdoms butchering the combat in exchange for a spy mechanic that frankly did not work, playing a more traditional entry like TROY also highlights and exacerbates the problems with more old-fashioned agents, being incredibly unbalanced. Priests and spies especially feel broken, and a single successful action by one of them can put an entire army out of commission for multiple turns.Combat, on the other hand, has its own problems. While a lot of complexity was added, with new terrain types and spearmen being able to switch between a two-handed grip and one-handed with shields, it feels wrong. That doesn't sound very professional, but its the only way I can describe it. I'm one of the few people who like TW: Attila, because its combat had weight behind it. it felt impactful. When fighting in TROY, however, models float around without a care in the world, and their animations are very simplistic. On top of that, battles have gotten even shorter than they were, with no time of room for strategy. How can I move my chariots or light units around to perform a pincer attack when battles often last less than five minutes? For me, the Shogun II, Rome II, and Attila eras were just right, allowing plenty of room for strategy in a battle that wasn't overly-long, unlike in Medieval II, where a unit of trained knights somehow would need five whole minutes to rout a bunch of peasants. The world has regained a bit of colour, and the maps are interesting, but all that potential was lost when you zoom in, and it all goes wrong.Lastly is the optimisation, or lack thereof. Ending turns takes forever, even when your speed up movement in the options menu. This gets especially tedious in the late-game, where the AI has so many armies that even the campaign map started to somehow lag. Just keep churning out the DLC, guys! That'll fix all of your problems!In conclusion, while TROY was a step in the right direction, a pretty campaign map and soundtrack doesn't solve boring battles and lag!FINAL SCORE: 5/10;14 September, 2021;

A Total War Saga: THRONES OF BRITANNIA;Blitz™;NOT INFORMED;1,066 people found this review helpful15 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 36.0 hrs on record;This may be a negative review but TOB is not a bad game, its a bad total war game. Its kinda weird so bear with me while i explain.Thrones of Britannia is a saga title which means this is the smallest in scale but most focused total war which you can get. I get the idea of saga games and i support it but i expect more of them both in regards to scale and features, this feels an awful lot like an overpriced dlc as nothing it brings to the title feels substantial to justify a new title.The art style is beautiful, unit cards, user interface, 3D units and 3D environments like the battle maps (and the campaign map) are truly superb. Artistically speaking, the real gem in this game are the siege maps. Trust me when i say that they are a work of art, however in true total war fashion, the ai is incapable of properly using them.The game also features one of the oldest and most favourite features in total wars that i ever had, the battle maps respond to the location you are in the campaign map. If your army in the campaign map is in a hill near a river that will be reflected in the battle map etc.Furthermore, this is built on an optimized version of the Attila engine which means that you get cool things like units setting fire to buildings and forests, unlike Attila however this runs well.This brings me an opportunity to sidetrack from this review and call out CA for throwing Attila under the bus by never fixing the performance problems it had. Yes, i get that it never sold well but us loyal customers who bought it and got a subpar game in performance it feels like we got cheated.Anyhow, returning to TOB this game features many small differences to classic total wars. First and foremost is recruitment, instead of waiting a turn to get a couple of fully new units, in TOB you can immediately recruit as many units you want, provided that you can afford their recrutiment cost and food/gold upkeep. These new units will start with only a few men and fill over time. This is a superb mechanic and a much better way than the one we had before, food upkeep for units is also a great addition. However, there's also MAJOR problems with how recruitment works. TOB also features a global recruitment pool, which in combination with the previous mechanic means that you can capture a settlement deep in your enemy's lands and instantly build a new army (with elite units too) there. Yes that army won't be in full health but it's still a weird mechanic that you and the AI can exploit.This is exacerbated by the lack of any religion or culture mechanics as both of those things could have alleviated the aforementioned problem by requiring some time to 'assimilate' the population of the newly conquered settlement before recruiting armies there.Besides religion and culture, CA also threw agents, forced march, ambush and trade agreements to the chopping block. This is deeply troubling and takes total war several steps backwards. Now we can't assasinate enemy generals, we can't scout enemy lands so armies move blindly in the campaign map etc. I get that agents never worked properly but removing a great feature instead of optimizing it is not fixing the problem. I can't consiously support this new direction.Same goes for forced march and ambush, instead of getting these mechanics fixed they were cut out entirely, a really bad decision that i hope future total war titles wont follow.Another TERRIBLE decision is that minor settlements don't have walls or garrisons (at all!), this means that a single general unit can capture multiple settlements without any opposition. This is something that the AI also abuses. Eventually, this exacerbates the biggest problem all total war games have, steamrolling the ai. Like i mentioned this is something that is prevalent in all total war games but in this game it's completely out of control because of the aforementioned reasons, resulting in very small campaigns that you can win in a matter of a few hours. To give you an idea, i achieved an ultimate victory on very hard, on my first campaign in less than 7 hours (and that included the learning curve of me adjusting with everything that changed in this title). This game is just ridiculously easy because of how streamlined it is.Once you reach a certain point in your campaigns, you're completely and utterly unbeatable. After this point, i never had to check my food or money situation, i didn't care about my general's loyalty because i could hand them a ton of estates that i got by sending single general armies to take multiple minor settlements whilst my full stacked armies took the major ones, completely wiping out the AI in a matter of a few turns with nearly zero opposition as the AI was extremely passive.There's other little differences to classic total war games, like how you upgrade units or unlock branches of the technology tree by doing specific actions and these are kinda cool but i feel that eventually this is not a very well thought out game that crumbles under the weight of the bad decisions the directors made.So where does that leave us?I can't support in any way the removal of features and i am not convinced by the director's rationalization of why culture, religion, forced march/ambush stance and agents were removed. This is a HUGE STEP BACKWARDS.Moreover, what TOB brings to the table is a mixed bag of recycled features from older total war titles that haven't been really thought out well and don't quite work well with each other. Nothing in this game justifies a new title at it's current price. For the aforementioned reasons, TOB is a great entry game to the total war series for someone who has never played total war before because of how streamlined and easy it is. But for the same reason, it's an exceptionally bad game for veteran players. So I'd suggest getting this only at a sale for something like 15 euros.;6 May, 2018;
A Total War Saga: THRONES OF BRITANNIA;**Greg;NOT INFORMED;580 people found this review helpful11 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 29.4 hrs on record;I really wanted to like this one. Unfortunately, I really regret buying it.It feels like a demo...or an alpha version of a larger game. It's very well presented, and there are a few new features (recruitment has changed and.....actually I think that's it). But it completely lacks any......substance. Or challenge. Everything seems so small and short.I've played through one campaign as one of the Scottish factions. At first it was alright, but as soon as I had a few stacks, it was just a case of hopping from village to village, taking each one without challenge. Occasionally I'd need to take a city, which always had to same garrison, and the AI always acted in the same way. I stopped manually fighting them after five or six. One full stack of my own was always enough to autoresolve in victory. Once or twice the enemy AI would bring an army or two to the field, but they were easy enough to beat. Next thing I know I've won, and hold most of the British Isles.It feels like the game shoehorns in challenge from the Viking invaders (especially at the end) because the AI isn't good enough to create a sensible challenge on it's own (short of upping the difficults and giving them more cash, which essentially just means....more stacks). But whether it's more faction stacks, or shoehorned Viking stacks, it's a very boring challenge, and this is mainly because the battle AI has been exactly the same since Medieval 2. They form up with their infantry in the middle, archers behind, and cavalry on the flanks. They'll either march the whole formation straight at you, or wait until you move one of your ranged units into range, and then march the whole formation at you. I really used to like these games, but it's just boring now. And the AI only ever forms stacks of 20 units, always with the same composition, so it is almost literally the same battle over and over.By the end I just gave up. It just felt like a chore, going village to village, with nothing else to do but that.I could go into how villages have only one building, and you don't get to choose that building, or I could go into the fact that all the units feel exactly the same, or that the diplomacy is just so shallow, or that everything seems so short, but the other reviews cover those sorts of points quite well. I just wanted to add that really, I feel this formula has run its course. You could just play Attila, and get the same gameplay, but bigger and better. This feels like it should have been about half the price, and I still probably wouldn't have bought it in hindsight. I got bored of my current campaign when the game spawned in dozens of Viking invader stacks, not because it seemed too hard, but because the thought of stopping my conquest to go and fight each and every one in the same battle over and over just...made me not want to play with this formula any more. It's boring.I'll keep an eye on Three Kingdoms, but honestly, unless CA seriously revamp the AI, I think I'm about done with this series. As it stands, it just feels more...lifeless....with each title.;14 May, 2018;
A Total War Saga: THRONES OF BRITANNIA;DrTrevor;NOT INFORMED;194 people found this review helpful; Recommended 432.1 hrs on record;"I'm writing this review specifically because of the Historical Total War sales going on today.This game caught a lot of flak upon release, and while some of that was warranted, I believe it was mostly a case of expectations being too high which will almost always lead to disappointment. It is probably the most straight forward Total War, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a more streamlined Total War game, which allows for more battles, and shorter campaigns. Thrones of Brittania (ToB) is perfect for you. Not to mention if you're a fan of the time period, but if that's the case you've probably already bought the game.Here are my Pros when comparing ToB with the other Historical Total Wars:-Possibly has the best siege battles, with a ton of unique siege maps that can make for really epic and interesting battles-Has 8 distinct factions that all play quite differently, allowing for fairly decent replayability-The campaign map is gorgeous-Has ""short campaign"" victory conditions, allowing for shorter campaigns that can still feel satisfying, and not at all drawn out/tedious (unlike essentially every other Historical Total War, save for maybe Shogun 2)-Yet it also has the ""ultimate campaign"" victory conditions, which plays out as probably the best end game (again save for maybe Shogun 2). Although it's unlikely you'd play this long of a campaign too often, as it can be tedious to get to this point.-The focus on food as a resource and the recruitment system plays out much better to me. Wiping out an enemy army actually has an impact, and you'll rarely want to disband troops in the early game. This is in contrast to games like Rome 2 and Attila where I always found myself going back and fourth from times of conquest, then disbanding all my non-elite armies, and focusing on the economy.I'm not going to list any cons because IMO there's not really anything wrong with this game that wasn't already wrong with Rome 2 or Attila. It is a slightly different take compared to those two, but I think the changes they are all positive (okay, except for maybe the estates system).In conclusion, I'd highly recommend getting this game now that it's 66% off and try putting all the negative reviews you've heard about it out of your mind. Give yourself a chance to have some fun with it. Although if you don't have Rome 2 or Attila yet, at 75% off, you'll get SIGNIFICANTLY more content buying those games.On top of that, Age of Charlemagne and Rise of the Republic are probably the best Historical Total War DLCs we've had in a long time. They'd also have great content/dollar ratio. Grab em if you haven't already done so. All that being said, if you never gave ToB a chance because of all the negative reviews, now's a great time to do so. (if you've already bought most of the other Historical Total War content...). Although I should note that I've yet to play 3 Kingdoms, so if money ain't no thang, probably try that out first.";26 September, 2019;

I love Total War and I started playing with Rome Total War the first Rome title. I've not missed one since. My favourite was Medeival 2 though I love Empire, Napoleon, Rome 1 & 2 and Warhammer 1 & 2. Shogun 2 was okay. I have the Chinese one on preorder. Just to establish my devotion and general enthusiasm to the series.I f@#ck@#g hate Kingdom. As a Scot I love the idea of being able to play in my own country and having access to historical units. The problem is that this is the most dumbed down, poorly thought out and executed edition I've come across. If this was my first experience I would never have bought a title again. I'm starting to think Creative Assembly have totally forgotten about who their customers are because recently they are constantly degraded our level of control and removing the detail that we love. We like lots of different types of units which are lovingly rendered. We want a chance to be able to win when the odds are stacked against the possibility by use of formations, unit mixes, creative economic management. We don't want cartoon unit cards, auto garrisons, inexperienced units to be nearly equated with battle hardened ones and spending all our time with constant rebellions. The latter is really annoying because its not historically accurate. In real life the quality of the garrisons would outmatch any local rebellion but instead its vice versa.;20 October, 2018;

A Total War Saga: THRONES OF BRITANNIA;Rat;NOT INFORMED;1,694 people found this review helpful36 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 10.8 hrs on record;I own every Total War Game from the first Shogun:Total War to the Warhammer 2, I even bought Rome: Total War just last year for the sake of old memories but its with a heavy heart that im writing a negative review for a Total War game. Overall, this wasn't meant to be a ''full'' game as we all know its basically a re-skined Attila total war and I didnt not expect much when i pre-order it, but Its way too dumbed down for a Total war player of over 15 years.Firstly, the new food upkeep. In Thrones of Britannia, every unit need food upkeep. I praise the developer for this mechanism as this means that there is no longer a 20-unit doom stack for every 1-province minor factions. (Im sure every player hated this) However it made the game way too easy for me, I had a campaign where i merely need to capture the AI food production towns, the AI never raised another army for 15 turns as they did not have any food producing facilities and towns, there was nothing to do except to siege them one by one after destroying their standing army. Secondly, the new province system. The province system are another way that is too dumbed down as well, there are 2 aspect to this. In the building section of the new province system, every small town is no longer customizable, gone are the days in Rome 2 and Attila where you have to plan and strategize which town to upgrade and which facilities to build to manage your limited food supplies. In this game, a town produces what the developers have ''preset'' it produce, this sucks much fun out of the campaign and you merely need to focus on winning battles.The battle aspect of the towns is even worse, there are no longer ANY garrison in towns. Not even a 3 unit levy we had since Empire: Total War, welcome back the days in Medieval 2 where you had to have garrisons in every important town. In the campaign, you need to have so many generals to protect your small towns, and if you don't, the AI will send it 2-3 units stack to capture your small towns and wreck as much havoc as possible. Furthermore, fighting in towns and garrisoning them no longer have any defenders advantage, most of the buildings in battle are merely place holder, I couldn't even navigate my Calvary through the streets in-between buildings while there are no longer points to defend and its just a Melee fest to see who slaughters whom first. The only advantage that i seem to get with my generals garrisoning towns are the slight boost to unit's Morale.Thirdly, the Public Order system. Ever since Rome 2 we had a Public Order system that ranged from -100 to 100, this has been changed. Public order is no longer cumulative and now has a negative and positive value in which negative Public Order would give a % that a rebellion will occur, this means you only need to pray to RNJesus that rebellion wont happen. (I had rebellion triggering on as low as 5% and it messed up my economy so quickly) On another note, I do not know if its to simulate Anglo-Saxons unhappiness with the Vikings but 20-30 turns in, rebellions will start popping up against the AI everywhere, and if they captures a town that produces food, the rebel units will spawn recruit even more rebels which the AI cant kill. I ended up fighting more rebels than other factions.Lastly, the recruitment system. I have mixed feelings regarding this aspect, I welcome how new units are raised at around 25% of their numbers as this means that the enemy cant get another 20-stack full units in 3-4 turns, but it triggers me how the recruitment is now global and instant after 15 years of playing, I just captured an enemy town deep inside their lands and I can immediately reinforce my weakened 5-units army in a 20-unit army immediately. We don't even have to build training centers anymore as most units are available to you on hand while the rest are ''unlocked'' via technologies.While there are minor silly stuff such as silly technologies requirement or 0 historical battles. (I enjoyed the historical and quest battle from previous series)I love Total War, both its historical and fantasy titles and I was looking forward to Thrones of Britannia to quench my thirst for Historical settings and battle. But if you are a long-time Total War fan, DO NOT buy this game as you will be sorely disappointed, you will be better off playing Attila or Rome 2. If you are a new fan however, do not let this game lower your expectation of Total War, this is just a smaller scale version of other Total War games and thus the cheaper price of $40, try playing Attila or Rome 2 or even Medieval 2 and fall in love with Total War via them. I just hope most of the things they implement here are for Total War Saga and wont affect the upcoming Three Kingdoms, I would hate to be disappointed twice in a row.;3 May, 2018;

A Total War Saga: THRONES OF BRITANNIA;Simonson;NOT INFORMED;102 people found this review helpful; Recommended 111.9 hrs on record;"After all the B.S. at release, this ended up being a fun game. There is nothing really wrong with it other than it not being as ""epic"" as the Warhammer series. In contrast to the bigger games, this one feels far more manageable and focused on what it wants to achieve, which ends up being a very polished dark age total war. Battles are surprisingly good. I've had enemy AI armies feign attacks, only to fall back when I countercharged, pulling my men out of position. The AI holds men in reserve (archers and infantry), until they're most needed in battle, and then commits them when they're most effective. I've had enemy generals withdraw from losing clashes, to rest a bit before charging in again. I've watched enemy infantry flank around my army to get into my rear lines before charging in. I personally think the battles are the best in the series so far, due to the tactics and surprises the enemy AI throws at you. I don't think the enemy AI in this game gets enough credit. A warhammer clash is predictable and even boring most of the time, as their army charges into yours, with maybe their cavalry trying an ineffective flank attempt, but once the lines are engaged, that's pretty much it. In this game, I spend time actually maneuvering my lines before the engagement - and so does the AI. It's a bit of cat and mouse before we even start fighting as we each try to get the advantage. Sometimes I swear the enemy AI is trying get me to commit, sending out a unit of pricey infantry, only to pull back when I counter, and send a unit of cheap spears to absorb my charge. Then when I'm engaged with expendable unit, it charges back in with it's good infantry. It really is that good. Take away all the spells and dragons and the rest we're used to in other Total War games, and you're left with a purely tactical battle system that rewards effective use of your refreshingly mundane troops. The campaign map also requires a different strategy than other total war games. Because minor settlements don't have garrisons, you start to understand that winning wars isn't necessarily about taking settlements, but destroying armies. In my last game, there was a situation where I had the choice to either take a minor undefended town, or attack and destroy my enemy's weakened stack. I chose the latter, because with no garrisons for towns, the enemy army could have easily threatened my towns if I bypassed it. These lack of garrisons also make you analyze the map for strategic and defensive advantages. Bridges over rivers are vital choke points again. You find yourself trying to deduce where the enemy will move their army next turn to try and cut them off, mirroring them without attacking, keeping their army in check. This is entirely realistic, as opposed to other total war games where it's simply a matter of right clicking on the enemy army, who happily awaits your attack, is destroyed, and then recruits another full stack next turn. Or not caring about enemy troops in your territory because every settlement has a garrison. Towns on the frontier in this game can change hands back and forth until someone finally gains the upper hand and wins a decisive battle. An enemy army that slips past your defense can cause havoc. These are things real generals had to worry about, and they are faithfully represented here. I understand why some would complain about it, because it sometimes requires serious thought as to what your next move should be on the battlefield. This isn't a mindless lightshow total war where you click and watch the fireworks, it's a Total War that has gone back to its roots as a strategy game. War is meaningful, and not to be undertaken without a clear strategy for victory. A lost battle could mean a lost King, or heir, or valuable general. No immortal heroes here. This all gives each battle a weight that can echo for the rest of the game.All of this excellent campaign and battle strategy gameplay is layered with a robust domestic and political simulation. Lords vie for increased power in your kingdom, and their loyalty is a constant concern. There are numerous strategic choices to be made on the domestic side of things too, as buildings and retainers give your generals traits that can have important effects. Where should you build that blacksmith? Should this province focus on feeding your armies, or commerce, or maybe be a beacon of Christianity to the pagan hordes? Should you betroth your daughter to your top general, or send her to form an alliance with the emerging kingdom to the north that could threaten your borders? Each choice here is meaningful. If you haven't played it, or were put off by the negativity at release, you owe to yourself as a total war fan to give it a try. You'll probably be surprised at just how interesting and fun this game actually is. Play the systems and mechanics the devs had crafted for you here. It's not Warhammer, and it's not meant to be. Resist the urge to download mods that simplify the game and make it easy, taking away tactical and strategic choices, just because you're used to something else in your total war games. Play the game. Have and enemy army slip by and ransack your undefended hamlets. Get in over your head with a bad war declaration. Lose your best general, your heir, your king, and don't save scum. Watch as a disloyal lord you've ignored rebels against you just as the viking hordes are closing in. Play it out like it's a real history. See what happens. Learn. Improve, and you'll see that this game has a great deal of depth and excitement that hasn't been seen in total war for years.";26 July, 2020;

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition;salvador242;NOT INFORMED;909 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 141.8 hrs on record;First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on. This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books by Andrzej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.;26 November, 2013;

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition;[AReV]Nomed;NOT INFORMED;368 people found this review helpful; Recommended 51.4 hrs on record;Originally released in 2011, The Witcher 2 flew under the radar for a lot of people and was overshadowed by the ever-popular Skyrim. While not as well known, The Witcher 2 offers a much stronger narrative along with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and varied areas.You once again play as the Witcher. Geralt, who finds himself protecting King Foltest of Temaria after an assassination attempt. Ultimately, the second attempt succeeds and Geralt is framed for the murder. After escaping from a Temarian dungeon, Geralt decides to track down the real kingslayer in order to clear his name while trying to piece together his fragmented memory.The game is separated into three chapters each with their own main area along with a handful of side-quests. These areas are structured and paced well, allowing room for exploration without straying too far from the main storyline. The decisions you make along the way directly influence the narrative and can have a dramatic effect on the rest of the game. For example. decisions made in the first chapter can completely change the second, allowing plenty of room for re-playability. The game also features multiple endings, which vary based on your choices.The choices are morally ambiguous. there is no clear right or wrong answer in most cases. It’s more about choosing a side and watching the events unfold. While the first Witcher game focused more on slaying monsters, Geralt is trapped in the middle of political turmoil in this installment. These elements of the story add an additional level of complexity and immersion as the game feels almost similar to a season of Game of Thrones. Playing the first game is by no means necessary to enjoying The Witcher 2 as it provides plenty of backstory as well as a solid and cohesive narrative.The combat is solid as the game will have you balance between swordplay, magic, as well as parrying and dodging. The use of traps can also add an additional level of strategy and planning to most encounters. There is also the inclusion of alchemy, allowing Geralt to drink various potions each with different passive bonuses as well as negative side effects. The potions are generally used on a trial and error basis though, since Geralt isn’t able to use them during combat. The game does provide a reasonable challenge, especially on the harder difficulties, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other titles released these days.Orens, the main currency in the game is rather scarce, placing a large emphasis on crafting. The crafting system is solid and will have you hoarding as many resources as possible in order to create various armor, traps, weapons, and upgrades.CD Projekt Red is a company that really loves their fans. While other developers release paid DLC, CDPR released an Enhanced Edition at no additional cost which added multiple cut-scenes, quests, and additional polish. The soundtrack is fantastic, as it really adds an epic feel to the game. The voice acting for the main characters is top-notch while some of the acting for the additional characters is re-used but that is to be expected considering the overall length of the game.The graphics are absolutely stunning, as the environments are extremely detailed and varied. The character models and armor look great, although the facial animations can be a bit stiff and lifeless at times. You really have to look hard for low-res textures as even the smallest objects are carefully rendered.Overall, The Witcher 2 is a game that should be played by anyone that is a fan of the genre. It features benchmark graphics, a top-shelf narrative, and offers plenty of content along with elements of re-playability.For a much more detailed and thorough review, here’s a video I edited together for my friend Trent:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEPbEpWHMeoThe Witcher 2 also made our list for the greatest games released over the past 8 years. If you’re curious to see how it stacks up, check out:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIHmom_lP4Pros:+ Choices actually shape the game adding elements of re-playability+ Excellent graphics+ Engaging main quest and side quests+ Combat massively improved from the first title+ Solid Voice ActingCons- No potions in combat can lead to trial and error- Stiff Facial Animations- I experienced a few bugs and random crashes.

The gameplay is very unrealistic to real-life house flipping which was sad because it just means nothing you do has any point. The main issues for me are1. No repercussions for mistakes (if you accidentally knock down the wrong wall, paint the wrong room etc. the customer doesn't even notice lol2. The tasks have really basic mechanics, e.g. to clean up a gigantic plank of wood on the ground you just click it, which is boring3. Its so easy to miss 1-2% of grass to mow or specks of dust to clean and they're impossible to find which is very annoying4. Maybe this is just something that bothers me but there's no people in the game it feels like a zombie apocolypse5. You get no feedback from customers thanking you or complaining or anything, its just like the game has no point bc if you do something wrong nothing happensAnyway overall its a bit of fun if its on sale but otherwise don't bother; 10 June;

Have a Nice Death;Acencial;194 products in account;391 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 9.5 hrs on record;This is one of the hardest games ever for me to decide whether I'd recommend it to someone or not. The sense of style that this game oozes, the exceptional options menu, the charming and immersive music and character that this game has is some of the best in a 2d game. It just radiates character. The moveset that Death uses is also absolutely amazing. It feels like playing mini simplified Devil May Cry because of quick combos that you can pull off and how many moves each weapon has. If this is enough to get you excited to play this game, it is probably gonna be a game that you'd enjoy at least to some extent. But the issue comes from the fact that the strategies to deal with 90% of 'minion' enemies is to dash into their face while evading 1 attack and then hitting them. Once you hit them they are stunned and you just need to spam click or use a spell that is off cooldown and you are done. So all the amazing moves that you have at your disposal just come down to passing a dps check on a static enemy, and it completely shut down my will to play the game after I've realized that. That being said, the game is reviewed overwhelmingly positive and even I love so many things about this game that I am so torn whether or not to recommend it. If you resonate with what I've written here and you're someone who is a rogue like or character action enjoyer, I've made a more in-depth video because nobody (including me) will read a wall of text. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkTUJKpmyuk;21 March, 2023;

The story is really cute, the minions and bosses get harder over the stages, the gameplay is very smooth but I still miss some things so far:- better rewards for killing the minions. I can just run past them because I don't feel rewarded for killing everyone of them (I still do it because it feels right, but I don't get the feeling that I need to)- more diversity for replay potential. Almost every run feels the same. Beating the game doesn't seem to add anything new- better discriptions for the effects or weapons. I see weapons and skills and don't even use them because I don't see the need to play them. A tier list would be very quick to set up because the efficiency of the possibilites is not balanced.I will look forward to play this game but for now, my 14 hrs are enough for a while.[Edit: I know the game is in early access.

Like for example make us choose a book cover for Pitibook I believe. Making us acquire certain perks in every run so each run is unique. E.g. gains permanent hp after each department or lower cooldown of spells and weapons. Just like what Wizard of Legends do.- more modifiers for the scythe!!! It's kinda boring using the same scythe over and over until you find a decent weapon/ spells.- I wish spells have different binding key.

I waited a year for the Steam version, not for the EGS version poorly repackaged as the steam version.DI2 is a good game, but my review is going to stay firmly planted in negative merely from the principle of ""Don't tout coming to steam when you force people to install and use components of your own service to run the game.""

The survival elements are fairly simple and I find them well-tuned, and islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed. There's even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it. There's an excellent balance between the peaceful sea-faring and island exploring and occasionally battling. With the most recent story based updates the game has really expanded, although it's still unfinished and development seems very slow. Bring a ""friend"" as shark baitThe biggest benefit of Raft to me is the seamless co-op. Hosted on a local machine, your friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you. If you should want to let them progress without you, which I have done a few times, you can easily send them the file to load. It's not quite as good as it being persistently online, but it's easy enough. I played around 40 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled together, assigning jobs and positions, working as a team to explore the ocean and the land, baiting the shark away from the others, tucking unconscious bodies into bed, you know, all the sorts of things friends do for each other.Chest WarsHowever, I will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage. I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categories, painstakingly labelled with signs, and then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed box, or scuba gear into my food box. In the end I told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it. It staved off divorce. I also got yelled at a few times for re-arranging the rooms, but really, these guys have no interior design skills! Look I'm type A okay, I need order on my boat, even in the apocalypse.What's bad?The main drawback is that the development is slower than me running a marathon with ankle weights on. It's getting there, but no one knows when it'll pass the finish line and you're just hoping it doesn't have a heart attack en route. I'm patiently waiting, but I do wish the full experience was ready.

Automobilista 2;DicraeoF1;NOT INFORMED;117 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 2,357.4 hrs on record;Updated as of March 2024:I have been playing this game for almost four years now, and the review I updated in 2022 deserves another couple of adjustments. I am very happy with how this game moved along, but I'm not going to try and pretend this game has reached anywhere near perfection.Back when I wrote this review, I told people to buy this game. I still think you're making a good investment if you do, with a lot of vanilla content and generally fairly priced DLC. After countless, countless of physics changes, the game still has not quite arrived where it wants to be. however it is very close. With some cars, closer than with others. You will notice that this game allows the user to save slides more than others, and this is essentially correct. However, the cars tend to be generally a bit too slidey on traction, struggling to put power down more notably than expected, and they also tend to reward a driving style that leans towards drifting (particularly bad in the GT3 class of all things). On the other hand, the Force Feedback is very good at telling you what the car's doing. the cars feel very dynamic, braking behaviour requires more finesse than in other sims (looking at you, ACC) and in general, driving cars in this is a very fun experience that feels organic instead of pre-programmed. It's got the aforementioned weaknesses to be ironed out still, but the developer has acknowledged most of these and is harder at work on fixing them than most will imagine. When getting this game, you need to understand what it is and isn't trying to do: If you look for a great multiplayer experience with minimal bugs and a good list of features, I'd suggest you to look elsewhere. If you look for a fun, quick driving experience, you are very well off buying this. If you're interested in historic racing or offline racing, this is definitely the best choice for the former and in the top 2 for the latter (the other being, ironically, iRacing). The game has a couple of other selling points to which I'll try to list in the following: Selling Point #1: Reiza Studios are relentless. There are ambitious plans for the game, and they keep on working, keep on delivering and keep on improving the sim. Every 2-3 months, there's an update (and its usual hotfixes) to look forward to, and it's never a step back. This game is a journey to enjoy, one where the horizons generally tend to get brighter. Sometimes, it still feels like the workload is huge, and the game definitely has some way to go until it is a finished product - but there is a lot of fun to be had with what's on offer already, and there's fun to be had in seeing it evolve.Selling point #2: Multiplayer. There are many bad things about the current multiplayer, but there's one perk I still think to be underrated:No other sim except for Project CARS 2 can be picked up and played the way this can. You do not have to fiddle with setting up servers, you can simply set up your own lobby to your liking within a minute, and have great races with friends. Selling point #3: Obscure content. You will want to drive on Cleveland, Cascavel, Cascais (some would say Estoril) 1988, the Nürburgring Nord-and Südschleife 1971, Bathurst 1983, Santa Cruz do Sul, and you will want to do it with ARC Camaros, Brazilian Stock Cars or a 70's junior formula car. You just don't know it yet.Selling point #4: VR-support. If you own a VR device, buying is basically a no-brainer, because there is no comparable performing sim for VR on the market.Selling point #5: F1 cars. If you're an F1 fan, this has F1 cars from nearly every era you might think of. Most aren't licensed, but they still, at least to me, feel like proper representations of their respective area - and fitting skins can be found on RaceDepartment. Also, there are some interesting details in here - like the '97 McLaren, which had an additional brake pedal that is recreated in the sim.Selling point #6: The AI are continually improved, continually enhanced, and they have gotten to a point where, if you manage to find a combination where they are on your pace (which is by far not as hard as it used to be), they are very likely to provide a fun experience. They take mostly realistic lines, they will race you, and while it's sometimes noticeable that they have different physics, it doesn't detract from the overall satisfying experience that (now the physics are stable) will be enhanced even more. AI are a big development focus in this, are heavily supported by the community feedback and they already often provide better races than any multiplayer lobby. They do still have deficits in their racing behaviour, but as stated above, this area is more likely to improve than any other in the game.A couple caveats have to be admitted, too, though: Multiplayer, as said above, is not suited for serious racing and riddled with game-breaking bugs, especially if things like dynamic weather or pit stops are added. The AI don't know how to initiate overtakes on straights most of the time and do not defend the inside - they only start to race well once you're side by side. They also don't care about dirty air, whereas the player very much does, giving them a couple unfair advantages in high downforce cars. Finally, the game does not support modding. I'm not sure it makes a difference, though, because the track list is pretty impressive (~40 locations, and many of these have very different historical versions). For me, AMS2 has been the most worthwhile sim game I've purchased. Join now, and watch as a (not-anymore-so) ragged diamond is carefully carved to perfection. Very much recommended.;25 August, 2020;

And boy let me tell you this whole year has been a journey!I'm racing in real life for over 14 years. And never have I experienced a sim that comes so incredibly close to the real thing than AMS2. For example: the rain conditions. SPOT ON! I've raced a lot in the wet. And I love it. When I drove in AMS2 for the first time in the rain. I was blown away how realistic this is.After some time I started in some leagues. I've found great friends from everywhere in the world that are really great guys to race with. And of course at some point I created my own league. So yesterday was the release of the Racin' USA pack. What we got is revolutionary for simracing! We have 42 years of weather data from every day on every track. If I want to drive in rainy Hockenheim 2019, sure, nothing is going to stop me. I can even use the weather from Imola 1988 for example. That. Is. Mind. Blowing!Now onto the physics. Many people don't liked them before the update. But they'll gonna like it now. You feel like you are really there in the sim. In the car and on the track.The Youtubers that don't even have a go casually in AMS2 are so wrong. And now after the update a lot of online lobbys are there that are full with drivers. I've hosted multiple servers today and I had on each server max 28 drivers. AMS2 is a new Standart in sim racing. This is the future. This sim is done by a incredibly small team with a very limited budget. But look what it's become. It's become the best sim there ever was. And I've played them all!;5 June, 2021;

That was the general consensus when they let us know that Automobilista 2 would be sporting the Madness Engine, from the Project C.A.R.S franchise. It was expected that they’d go for the new IsiMotor engine from rFactor 2, which is considered by many as the most accurate simulator out there in terms of raw physics, aerodynamics, ambient simulation (how the climate interferes with the track and car and so on). Yet they went with a rather questionable option, derived from Need for Speed Shift, a simcade at best, which also defines the pCARS franchise. Could it be that Reiza wanted to broaden their public and adopt an arcadey approach? Or maybe they would try and build a solid simulator out of it? After 30 hours of tinkering with all the content and under different weather conditions, I can safely say it’s the latter. And it doesn’t surprise me one bit.To understand why it’s not a surprise to me, we need to go back in time, before;4 July, 2020;
Automobilista 2;Shanakar;NOT INFORMED;86 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 40.8 hrs on record;Automobilista 2 as of February 2024, is it worth buying? Well, yes and no but mostly yes. I've been sim-racing since the 90s and sim-developing since the early 2000s having worked with a number of developers over the years. I've only just recently picked up Automobilista 2 however and never played the original. Why is that? Well I've been more into pure sims such as rFactor, rFactor 2 and iRacing to care for much else but recently I branched out and decided, what the heck, I'll give it a try because I keep hearing it has the best Offline Single Player AI in any game. So here goes with the review.Automobilista 2 surprised me. I went into it expecting to be disappointed and while I was in some area that I'll explain later in this review, for the most part. I was pleasantly surprised.Content: The amount of cars in the default game without having to buy any DLC is phenomenal. The best offering of different series and era and car types for a racing game of it's genre. Even track wise you get a large variety that allows you to experience each of the cars in a wide variety of tracks that fit their category.Race/Championship Setup Options: The options you are given access to to set up a race from having Practice, Qualifying, Race 1 and Race 2 are well thought out and done very well. The Championship creation setup however needs some additional work and options. Not being able to create your own points system is a bit of a let down and a strange option to not include considering how much more other stuff is editable. I would say that is my only gripe about setting up a championship. Having to use one of the pre-existing points systems.Physics: The physics are very good, not pure sim like rFactor 2 or iRacing but it comes very close and I think I kinda prefer this more as pure-sim games have become far too advanced nowadays to be enjoyable for the common gamer which leaves the games in a state of low player base, low online attendance and even bad online experiences with amateur simmers. AMS2 provides a great level of sim physics with he ability to catch the car and correct your errors, to feel when you're about to lose control etc. It's very well balanced out.AI: I have seen people have mixed experiences with AI but for my experiences, the AI for single player have been the best I've seen in any game albeit a few hurdles that still need to be fixed. 1) AI are real bad on their fast lap, real slow, and sometimes that doesn't correct itself perfectly. This can happen in the races too where there will be certain corners that the AI will be overly slow even at 120 AI Strength which is the max it can go. 2) Sometimes AI spatial awareness can be bad. Most times it's fine but you'll get that one off here and there where the AI will just turn in on you or punt you from behind. Now that could be realism as it doesn't happen often, but can be frustrating when it does. 3) AI sometimes drive in the wet with the same grip they would have in the dry. It's not often, but one thing that is consistent in the wet is that the AI seem to have far more traction than the player does.Sounds: For my liking, the sounds are amazing, I like them a lot, but having been deaf three times in my life, I may not be the best judge on that. I do enjoy the sounds though and being able to hear an opponents engine as they are pulling up beside me from either side is great to help with my own spatial awareness.Modding: This is where AMS2 is a disappointment which is a surprise considering Renato started in modding. It's like a big finger was given to modders here. You can only add a skin by replacing an existing car skin, you cannot add another skin to a type of car to have an extra team in that series. I hope this changes because that is stupidly crazy. Car models have been given ID's for whatever stupid reason they can come up with and each car type has been given a limited number of slots which serve for the skins/liveries/AI drivers that will be permissable under that car model type. This limits the game so much. Even trying to replicate a specific season that had more drivers/teams than what is allowed in game for that car type is just silly. Come on Reiza, you can do better than that. This game could be huge, the biggest out there if you just opened up modding more.Controller/FFB: For me using the Thrustmaster TS-XW Sparco Racer PC Steering Wheel, the game is perfect, in fact, I love the FFB on it. Of course depending what Steering wheel system you use, it can require some setting up to get it perfect for you. In regards to handheld controllers like an Xbox Controller. You can get it to work very well but it takes time and adjusting. I've been able to get mine set up to a level where I can race like most other console games and still win races. But it took me hours to get it perfect, testing, adjusting, testing. But that's not a game issue, that's just what you have to do as a player.DLCs: The DLC's that have been released are worth buying, all of them, even if you don't like the genres. Branch out and try them out. You'll be pleasantly surprised. And if it helps Reiza get more funds in to keep expanding on this game, then that alone is worth it in my books.Overall: Automobilista 2 was a great susprise. I wasn't expecting to be surprised in the way I was. Overall the game is worth buying and having part of your Sim-Racing/Racing collection. The initial car offering is spectacular to say the least as are the tracks. The only negative I have is that modding needs to be done better. AMS2 could become the pinnacle of racing games but fails to capitalise because of the way they've set up their game. Maybe this can change in the future.If you love racing games with lots of different variety of racing genres, eras, etc, AMS2 is for you. Definitely worth trying. I will be doing career and other race videos on my twitch Channel and Youtube channel with the same name I use on Steam so keep an eye out as they will begin taking place in March/April 2024.; 24 February;

Automobilista 2;SenMithrarin;369 products in account;93 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 68.1 hrs on record;AMS 2 is a bit of a mixed bag right now.The quality of the experience depends heavily on which car you drive. Some feel like a great step in the right direction, and others feel completely unpredictable, even unfair in how they respond. The main stock cars, the modern F1, and the Formula V10 are all some of the better drives in the game.That said, no car truly outshines the previous game, and the game certainly still feels in development. While AMS 2 is leagues ahead of Project CARS, sprinkles of that game remain. The worst offender, in my opinion, is under braking. The brakes lack nuance, and often feel too powerful, with any touch of 100% brake power likely to cause a lock-up no matter how brief. Cars also seem skittish in the middle of the corners still, and a slight adjustment is likely to cause a spin despite feeling well within the limits of the car.But when AMS 2 is good, it's fantastic. Reiza have created a very strong foundation, and if they can keep improving, AMS 2 has the potential to be one of the best of all-time. Graphics are an obvious improvement, but I have also found the AI to be leaps ahead of the gMotor 2 AI in the previous game. They are very reactive to the player, but not as much to give up positions without a fight. They also make very human-like errors, which helps the race feel more alive than ever. So who is it for? AMS 2 is not a replacement of the first game yet. If you are looking for the next step, a full-featured masterpiece, certainly don't discredit this game - but it's not quite for you yet. If, however, you are an enthusiast, someone who's willing to put up with some lackluster experiences in order to follow the game closely - this sim will make some impressive first strides. Think of this game not in terms of how much you will spend for it, but rather, how much time you will invest. Not recommended for those who want a completed masterpiece, but easily suggested to any who want to see it grow.;31 March, 2020;
Automobilista 2;pretty;NOT INFORMED;58 people found this review helpful; Recommended 291.5 hrs on record;It's been a while since the AMS2 has been released. And now it finally became what we all hoped it will be - one of the most advanced and versatile sims on the market. So why you should buy it (Reiza offer good discounts every major Steam sale so if the money is tight, just wait till the next Steam sale) and why it decrowned ACC in my personal list?     Best weather system and seasons. Not only it has all possible weather presets from a sunny day to a thunderstorm, you can also set a historical weather from the last 40 years. The weather implementation is the best I’ve seen - it can rain over a part of the track while the other track will be completely dry, the changes in weather are seamless and feel very natural. Also every track comes with a pack of seasonal textures (except snow), the trees and grass change colours, deciduous trees loose their leaves in winter and so on. These details just add up so much to immersion.    Best real road implementation. AMS2 has a true dynamic real road: the rubber accumulates where the tires are loaded the most, the marbles outside the racing line are both visible and perceptible through the steering wheel. Dirt can be brought to the track and it affects the grip. When rain starts the rubbered line becomes slippery, then rubber gets washed away. And after the rain stops the racing line dries out first. Puddles are forming if the rain is strong enough, they then stay much longer on the track even if the sun dries out most of the track and you can get caught pretty badly on your slick tires. The possibilities of track conditions are pretty much endless. It is also worth mentioning that Reiza sorted out the puddles behaviour and they are not as deadly as in Project Cars.    Best Force Feedback. After the September update the FFB feels as good as it was in the AMS1. It’s fast, very responsive, you always know that the car is doing. AMS2 is the only sim where I can catch the slides using the FFB and I can feel the moment when the tires are having grip again (as it is IRL) and not just trying to guess the moment (it is like this in all other sims for me, I have non-DD Fanatec CSL Elite wheel).    Amazing AI. Reiza fixed the AI provided by the pCars engine, there’s no jerkiness in their behaviour, AI is predictable and competitive. AI cars don’t hesitate when there’s a gap, but still manage to keep it safe. They can attack you and each other or choose the defending line when they feel threatened. They make errors and every AI driver has their own behaviour and skills level, which makes racing against AI much more realistic and immersive. Of course it's not perfect, the performance in different conditions my vary, especially during changes from dry to wet and vice versa. But it’s still a very enjoyable experience to drive against AI, AMS2 probably has the best AI of all non subscription-based sims on the market.     Physics are great. There's a lot of controversy about AMS2 physics. Many say it's same s pCars 2, and even though that was never completely true, in the first years the similarities were quite obvious. But after the patch 1.5.0 that came out in July '23 everything has changed - Reiza fixed the long term issue in tyre physics calculations in Madness engine which was the main reason for the floaty behaviour. And since the version 1.5.3 (came out in November 23) the debates are over. The cars behaviour is predictable, you can feel the weight distribution and the moment the tyres lose grip very well. You can still slide the cars and these slides are pretty controllable to some extent (as irl in fact), but that now costs you laptime and tyre live as it should. And that's just a hell lot of fun to search the car's limit in AMS2 because the game communicates very well on where the limit is.    Graphics are amazing and the engine is very well optimised. Even with a relatively old systems you can get great visual experience and won’t have to sacrifice graphics for performance a lot. I’ve heard the VR performance is the best (can’t confirm myself though).     Great sounds. I don’t know what kind of sorcery Reiza have done with the Madness engine, but the sounds are just amazing and have nothing in common with the pCars. That’s just another league really. Still not on par with RRE and ACC though, but a very good effort overall.     Damage modelling and mechanical failures. This is the most advanced sim in this regard really. You can set up damage from visual-only all the way up to the realistic levels when a slight contact with a wall can end up your race. If you abuse the car it can (and will) break. And a very nice addition is random failures you can turn on, there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing your rival having an engine failure in the end of the race. But beware, next time it can be your engine. xD Also tire flat-spotting implementation is the best on the market, you can literally ruin your tire in the first corner and suffer the lost of grip and feel vibrations through the FFB all race long, these vibrations will intensify when you load the flat-spotted tire more. As IRL, a flat-spotted tire will tend to lock up again and again making the situation even worse. Simply amazing!    Huge variety of cars. It has every single F1 era, slower Formula cars, a great amount of GT cars from the old GT1 to modern GT3, GT4 and GTE (all are amazing), prototypes, road legal cars, trucks, karts, rally cross cars and much more!     Great amount of high quality tracks. Unlike the predecessor, AMS2 provides a big amount of A grade tracks (make sure you also purchase the Premium Track Pack DLC with the base game). The quality of the tracks is great. What differs Reiza from the other game devs is that they also provide a high quality renditions of the legacy layouts. So you can drive old timers on the tracks they belong to. But of course not everything is so great, here’s the negatives:    Multiplayer is the biggest issue atm. The net code is actually pretty good, you can have some close battles without the risk of being punted by a ghost. But that’s pretty much all positive about it. The lobby browser is terrible, you cannot filter out full or inaccessible servers/lobbies. When you find a lobby to join, sometimes the game glitches and you cannot start the race. The assists like ABS or TC being randomly disallowed even though the server allows them. Hopefully Reiza will put a lot of efforts into multiplayer this year, this is the main reason the sim doesn’t get the attention it deserves.    Every big update requires you to reset setups, re-assign controls and change settings. At least it’s been like this in the past years. Not a big deal but is somewhat annoying.     The quality of the content is inconsistent. The older base game content can be twitchy, some cars have FFB, physics or sound issues. But this stuff gets more and more rare as Reiza slowly iron these problems out.;1 January, 2023;

I have since hung up my keys and live my days retired from the life, but firing this up with some noise cancelling headphones and hearing the engine noises, the turn indicator, the traffic, the air brakes, all of it takes me back.I'm not going to sit here and nitpick out everything it didn't quite get right, like how if you try to GTA it, you have increasing fines but IRL you flat out lose your license and face jail time lol. I'd rather focus on what it DID get right.Speaking of fines, the way they increase really makes it so if you do try to GTA it, you'll eventually start spending more money in fines than what you get from the load. Making it so that your profit margin increases dramatically for safe driving.;18 May, 2021;

Factorio;Jack;NOT INFORMED;2,773 people found this review helpful3,485 people found this review funny; Recommended 235.1 hrs on record;I started a co-op factory with a close friend. After a day of work, I stepped back, looked at what we built, and came to some realizations.1) I have no ??????? idea whats going on in this factory2) Half the components that directly interact with each other aren't even near one another, one of the machines producing copper cable for another machine to assemble into circuit boards is halfway across the ???????? refinery3) 90% of the conveyor belts are underground, and the rest are going so many directions this thing looks like a ball of yarn4) There is coal ??????? EVERYWHERE5) I maintain enough sanity to count to 56) Staring at this thing makes my eyes itch7) Looking away makes my brain itchThe scariest part is that it keeps getting bigger, and every time it gets bigger it somehow becomes MORE labrynthine. One of those ??????? conveyor belts goes all the way around the entire factory to deliver steel plates to a single assembler thats making bloody gears, and its right next to the refinery itself!Sometimes the factory breaks. We don't usually notice because of how much of a mess this thing is, and the breaks we do spot are often half an hour old and are a recurring problem. Rather than fix it, we simply unjam the machine and ignore it until it breaks again. The biggest problem to fixing it comes from our production lines. Normal production lines look like a grid. Ours looks like you threw a bunch of squares into a bowl of spaghetti noodles and gave the bowl to a five year old for a period of one to five minutes. This proccess results in either an empty bowl and a full five year old, a floor covered in noodles, or spaghetti all over the walls and ceiling with the squares nowhere to be found. Knowing the trend in increasing chaos and complexity the factory exhibits, probably all three.The factory is an empodiment of madness incomprehensible even to the men who built it, laid every unholy circuit of conveyor belt, a thousand arms madly spinning every second, countless plates of copper and iron in a complex dance the likes of which is unseen in the realm of mere mortals. There are sections that I have no idea how they work, and I BUILT THEM.The factory grows more complex with each passing second and more convoluted every milisecond. Perhaps the reason is in part due to each segment being constructed with no plans for future additions, then the future additions were constructed by forcibly adapting the existing segments, usually by shoving more tubes into it rather than actually redesigning it, and these futrue additions are also not planned for expansion. The end result is a cluster-???? so large in magnitude, the last time a cluster-???? rivaled it in size, God smote the town and turned its inhabitants into salt. Unfortunately no god can save us from this... thing.Having expanded it further its almost as if the factory has a mind of its own, an ever hungry consciousness burning with dark malevolence and the need to grow. It infects all who stand in its presence, compelling them to add to it. A hundred furnaces belch smoke and the black blood of the earth is torn from its cradle to fuel the fires of industry. The ecosystem is demolished and the skin of the planet is rent and shattered for its glittering treasures, tossed into the inferno of a thousand stone and metal prisons to be transformed, used to expand the malignant blight upon the world that we brought. Ten thousand steel cogs turn and steam fills the air as the never ending fires boil the oceans away to power the sprawling spiderweb of mechanised mayhem, ordered chaos at its purest, a hundred thousand plates of steel and copper cycle and swirl in patterns barely knowable by the very people that created them.Each day, the red and green fluids are pumped into glowing crystalline globes, each sparking and burning, discovering new knowledge and new machines. The factory grows. Each advance in technology only complicates matters. The factory grows. The new advances create a need for new resources. The factory grows. The new resources require new means of transportation. The factory grows. The new transportation feeds new machines that burn the new resources to produce blue fluids to discover new technology. The factory grows. The blue fluids feed the globes to reveal new truths, beginning the vicious cycle anew, a neverending circle of destruction and growth that will only end when every corner of the planet is scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet will never be scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet is infinite in size. The factory grows. The game will never be over.The factory grows.Epilogue://: Date: 6/21/[ERROR_NULL_VALUE]Resources have dried up again. The factory consumes all within its reach, insatiable in its hunger. Though it had experienced full production stoppages in the past, the factory could never be eliminated from the planet by the natives, for the sun itself powered the beams of destruction that maintained its borders. Within the creaking, ancient cogs and permanent haze of foul and polluted smoke, a single humanoid shape slowly rises to its feet. Aged, failing flesh and bone long ago replaced with steel and chrome, once polished and clean, now weathered by uncountable years of exposure to acid rain and blackened by thick, choking smog, form its excuse for a body. It could have left while it was still human, before it was consumed in body by the foundry it created to escape. It never had a chance to leave, mind and soul devoured in the pursuit of freedom. With slow, clanking steps and the steady drip of oil from its joints, like a bleeding mechanical nightmare brought to hideous life, it stands and rasps as it moves for the exit. Behind it, a thousand drones rise like a plague of locusts, ready to continue the endless harvest. As the abomination that was once a man steps towards the gates of the factory, a mighty space faring vessel lies decrepit in its dry dock deep within the core of the facility. It was supposed to be a way off the planet, the whole reason for the factory's construction. But soon, the building of the factory became the means and the end, no thought other than the constant urge to grow in its mind.The only machine resembling the human form in the entire world stepped out into the barren wasteland of the ruined world. A keening, howling wind tears across the surface, forests destroyed by the ruined atmosphere no longer keeping it in check.It is the cry of a dead world, echoing forever on a planet overtaken by the machine.;13 April, 2016;

In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.Automation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one.

It feels like it's mostly under control now, but today something triggered it to flair up again. Normally I'd just keep fretting forever, but this game actually made me see my anxiety and some other aspects of myself in a different light, a kinder light. It's definitely a bit frustrating at points, but it's a challenge I know I can make easier at any point, but don't want to. Maybe, like the main character, I have something to prove, something to gain from the struggle. There's this moment of catharsis when I complete a tricky area and I find pride in collecting all the strawberries I can, even the tricky ones. The gameplay is excellent, and honestly? Normally I'd get frustrated by repeated deaths, but there's a moment where it essentially tells you it's okay to fail because you're learning from it, and that really just put a lot into perspective for me. The levels are gorgeous, the music is amazing, the sense of emotion is a little overwhelming at times, the gameplay is rewarding, and the characters and even the mountain itself flow seemlessly together into a good story and metaphor. As a gamer, a writer, a psychology student, and someone who's struggled with her own mental health, I have to say this game is excellent on all accounts.

I've found that when you first start this game there is strong evidence that it pulls the odds in your favour, you can get away with calling with much weaker hands (eg: 7 10, or 3 J) and still beat much stronger hands most of the time. This carries on until you play on higher tables, on these there is (quite) strong evidence that if you play positive expectation valued hands you lose more money than you should. I'm not entirely sure how this game manipulates or determines the RNG, however, I strongly suspect that players who have purchased chips get some hidden ""dealer"" advantage on the higher tables. My analysis was based on 5,524 hands, with around 3,000 on smaller tables and the rest on the much higher tables.I'd strongly not recommend playing this, I've ran the same analysis on PokerStars and I've found their RNG to be much more statistically sound. Thanks for reading, all the best.Trimza";9 October, 2021;

Saying the game is ""RNG certified"" is just the biggest lie and I have no idea how they managed to get it past in their game. So let's start: ---1) (POKER): This game is supposed to be players vs players, but most of the time you will be matched with bots that have a pre-dealt hand (winning hand) even if you have pair of A's, the bot will somehow get a STRAIGHT or a FLUSH on the river card. And I know what you think ""bro it's just RNG... It's just luck"" - Try it yourself and you will see. Not once, twice or three times, but the bots will do this EVERY-SINGLE-TIME they get pre-dealt a straight or a flush.--- 2) SPIN & PLAY: Again it should be players vs players but there are bots in it too with the same-F*ing-Stragegy (pre-dealt winning hand). And the ""JACKPOT"" they show before the spin comes out? the 1000x Jackpot? Yeah, forget about it, will never happen. The biggest you can get is 12x, and good luck getting it (once every 100 games) You'll just be playing for 2x, 4x, and maybe once in a lifetime a 6x. COMPLETELY RIGGED. ---3) BLACKJACK: OH BOY IF WE GET INTO THIS ONE.... Basically made to make you think you can win to take it all away from you when you bet big. You have 4 bets you can do. EX: SMALL(500K), MEDIUM(1M), HIGH(2,5M) AND HIGHEST(5M). You start betting 500k, and wow, you win. Bet again, win again. Bet again, lose, and so on. Win rate can be 50-60%. Start betting more. 1-2.5 and you'll see your wins drop to 30-40%. NOW BET 5M I DARE YOU. YOU MAY WIN ONCE, OR TWICE, BUT WHAT IS THIS?

Connect your steam account with your smartphone and/or your tablet and you can play everywhere.The second plus is the integrated steamworks and steam achievements which was for me very important. This means you can play on your mobile devices and this counts as well for your stats you need to receive steam achievements. Very nice.More plus:The navigation in the game overlay is super easy and understandable immediately for new players. You receive enough play coins to play without buying coins with real money. It is possible of course but not necessary. The winnings (and losses) you earn are only in virtual currency.It is multiplayer only which gives it a special thrill playing against real players worldwide. Big fun, no risk. You can invite your friends, host a table and you can reward your friends every day with free coins.A lot of different play modes so you can find your relaxing fun gaming table or the more professional room ... and if you like hats - you found the place to be :)All in all as a not experienced poker player i am nicely surprised about this game which opened for me (and tataa – for my wife) the world of poker.

Step away from that aging game Minecraft and enjoy a finer more refined version with the only limiting factor in this game being your imagination as the things you can do and build are endless. Guaranteed thousands of hours of enjoyment!I'd love to give this review a thumbs up since this game is very deserving of it however, the community is a major part of any game and said community in this game is very unpleasant when it comes to discussing topics.Anything negative even remotely minor in being is met with extreme hostility which most of the time is uncalled for and unnecessary. I've not seen such fanaticism outside of Reddit and was genuinely surprised when attempting to share suggestions, potential changes, etc in the Steam discussion section as well as the official website. Give it a go as an observer and browse the general discussions section for a few days and see for yourself. I find it more pleasant and enjoyable discussing politics with the most hard headed of people than dealing with the majority of people on these forums.Other than that, 9/10 as mentioned at the beginning of my review. The game is a blast!!/editI wrote this review with more of a head in the sand approach as I didn't want to post the usual spiel of omg early access 10+ years wtf, etc. Yes, the game has its problems -- quite a few. Some new and some old/legacy ones (10+ years later). Though with its faults, the game can still be enjoyed to an extent (with mods). With the devs losing sight of their original vision and the slew of nonsensical updates, etc etc et al, i'd honestly give it a 5.5/10. But as I said, this game is still fun and can be enjoyed thoroughly (when overlooking some of the more annoying bugs).Amusing:https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/19d5cg7/i_dont_think_this_should_be_allowed_to_be_in/;30 December, 2018;

""Not another 'zombicide game' trying to say it's a 'survival game'."" But he got it for me, and it woud be rude to not atleast give it another shot. I'm rather glad I did.I started play in a -private game- with my friend, set to the medium difficulty. Day one was a mess, I figured I was playing another left4dead 'survival' game which was all about killing as many zombies as one humanly can before wandering to the next area. Well, after breaking a few weapons on zombies and getting no reward outside of what lint was in the zombie's pockets, I knew I was wrong, and night had begun to set in. My friend luckily -had- played before and warned me that things got a lot different at night, so we managed to make it through with no deaths, but many close calls.50 days in, I'm more than hooked. Survival is the key- Food, water, scavving, repairs and building at day. Shelter, security and stealth at night. Crafting damn near anything in a Alpha game, from multiple layers of cobblestone walls outside of what used to be a log cabin. Each peice taken the long crafting process of finding rocks, chopping them down into stone and then turning into cobblestone. More? We built a second story for storing items. More? Two layers of spiked pits surrounding our 'cabin' with only a ????? for us living people to cross. More? Another story, turned into a rooftop farm of corn, blueberries and potatos. Nights can get rough at the ""Spillway Estate"" as we have now dubbed our fortress, we try to keep quiet throughout the nights, limiting player activity to things that dont make sound, or carry foods on our person that generate smell. ( Yes, that's a thing!) A chest near the front door full of easy repaired and built weapons. Pistols, a shotgun and some ammo for it, fresh from the forge! when things get really bad- The newly crafted fallback point, a basement/bunker. Metal walls , floor, and roof, only one entry which is blocked in times of emergencies. Beds, emergency food and water (or tea!) supplies stored next to some of our most powerful weapons. ( Chainsaws, landmines, a rocket launcher, and a whole lot of shotgun ammo! )To sum it all up, it has a few minor bugs, but it's in alpha, and they generally get fixed up rather swiftly! Worth the money, great with friends- Especially when you notch up the difficulty and find yourself hiding for your life in a closet with nothing but a stick to protect yourself!Lots of potentiel, and fun as is.9/10(Aug 19, 2014 Update: 1)Been awhile since I posted this, but it has been brought to my attention that a good amount of people have read this. So I thought I owe it an update due to the many, many changes to the game:Crafting: Crafting is mostly the same beast as it was when I started, though so, so much more crisp now than it was before. A lot of the bugs have been worked out (Some still linger). You now can upgrate tiles after you lay them into more fortified version of their previous selves. (A wooden frame - Wooden block. - Reinforced wooden block - Metal reinforced wooden block.) As well as many other types of similar things, it's rather neat I think.Random world generation?! I admit the same ol' world was getting a bit old and such. So when I heard they had a random world with some neat UI upgrades I was excited. And it is nice, though has its bugs and the occasional cluster of buildings you recognise from the old world, but still adds a great stuff. Maps now have a ""fog of war"" making it harder, and more exciting to go scavanging!To come? I heard character creation comes at the next big patch. Could be wrong though.My rating remains the same.";18 April, 2014;

7 Days to Die;OlanDawes;NOT INFORMED;2,500 people found this review helpful62 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,281.8 hrs on record;One of my favorite games that I have played in the past five years has got to be 7 Days to Die, hands down, maybe even my absolute favorite.Whenever I try out a game, I dont play it for three or four hours before rating it, you're barely into a game to even rate it, in my opinion. At this moment, I'm 529 hours in, so I felt the time to review it was approaching fast, so here I am.Where do I begin? Well, I had been scrolling around on YouTube, looking for games to watch people play, when I accidentaly stubled upon this gem. I only saw Alpha 1 gameplay at the time, which barely resembles what this game is now. Despite how it looked, I had been looking for a survival base building game for a long time, so I bought it one weekend, and it absorbed my soul and then some.Whenever you first start, you have little to nothing on you. You have a bottle of water, a bandage, and some food to start with. You can loot your surroundings to get some basic materials to start making a stone axe to start getting wood to make a simple shack. If you don't want to build a base in the beginning, you can claim one of the many buildings and fortify it so it works as a home until you decide what you want.This task won't be easy, with zombies added into the mix. Depending on your difficulty, the zombies might be a niusance or an absolute nightmare to deal with. Every 7 days, a Zombie horde will come to attack you and destroy the precious progress you've made on your base, hence the name 7 Days to Die. In those 7 days, you will build your base, and get traps and weapons ready to survive the night and emerge victorious from your base when the morning comes.As the game goes on, it senses how well you're doing. If you're sweeping through the zombie hordes and haven't died in a while, It will send stronger zombies in more numbers to try to give the hardcorre people a challenge.There is a whole lot I could add into here, but for the sake of people who get bored of reading reviews all day, let me get to my pros and cons.Pros:-Lots of replayability. You can play a whole lot of this game and get the best stuff, and start all over again on another world with different settings to give your veteran self a bigger challenge, to keep the game fresh. EDIT: Even though the updates come rarely, there is SO MUCH added each update it's sometimes like you're playing an entirely different game.-Smart building. You can't just build a castle in the sky here! There is structual intergity in this game, so if you build a structure incorrectly or a zombie takes out an important support beam, the building could fall apart around you, along with your supplies being cast into the void.-Friendly Community. This community isn't like DayZ or some of the other communities that have murderous players lurking everywhere, there is a huge variety of servers, some being PvE(Player verses Enemy), others being PvP(Player verses Player), other servers being modded to give the game even more life.Cons:-Updates. The game does have updates, but they happen at least 3 or 4 times a year, so you will be playing the same thing for at least a couple of months before anything new is added, which is annoying at times.-Learning Curve. There are games like Space Engineer that have a very steep learning curve that makes casual players not want to pick these games up. 7 Days to Die can have this problem with new players at first, with so much to do and a horde on Day 7 being a problem that might overwhelm some players. I would reccomend watching some people play this first before jumping in, mainly so you have a vague idea on what you are doing. After that initial curve, the game definitely gets easier.-Graphics. If you are a big graphics gamer, then this game might be a bit dissapointing for you. The models, especially for the players, aren't too pretty to look at. The zombies are a bit better, but like I said, the graphics are a bit dissapointing to look at. The landscape is kind of blocky, but It is a minecraft-like game, so it is to be expected.Overall, this is one of my favorite games of all time. It does have it's flaws, like not super good graphics, a bit of a learning curve, few updates, and the occasional bug, but what it has far outclasses its cons, like solid gameplay, lots of repalyability, and having building physics that make you build smart and realistic. I would reccomend at least trying this game out, I think that you will enjoy it!;7 June, 2017;

The free version on Krita's official website, which includes everything that the ""paid version"" does.2.) Buy it on Steam.Krita is open source, so you can edit what you want and when you want. Krita is a FREE app, the only reason to buy it on Steam is for developer support or the convenience of updates. It is also possible to send a donation to the developers.I have been using Krita for 8 years, but only since the release of version 5.0 can I recommend this application. This update fixed many bugs, lags, crashes and other problems.What I would appreciate in the future is the possibility of transferring brushes from Photoshop directly to Krita. While creating Brushes in Krita is well done, it's more convenient to import a brush instead of making one from scratch.I recommend beginners to familiarize themselves with the application first, read the manual and learn shortcuts before deciding to start creating a masterpiece. I, for example, learn new things even after 8 years of using this beauty.Keep in mind that I'm not a professional artist and can't judge the full potential of this app. Still, I think it's a good app and a worthy competitor to Photoshop when it comes to painting. Even so, I can create decent paintings. I have a sample image displayed on my profile.To all drawing enthusiasts, I wish you good luck, fun and success using this application.

Krita;Bewts;NOT INFORMED;136 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 111.2 hrs on record;This is a great digital painting software that has a lot to offer. Included is everything you would need to get personal or even professional work done. You can flip and rotate the canvas like in SAI, there are perspective tools to guide scene creation, a plethora of usefull brushes (speedpaint sketch being my favorite), not to mention all the filters and photo manipulation that you would find in photoshop. I love that I can resize the canvas without interfiering with the drawing. I love that every brush can be used as an eraser with just a toggle key. It's as fast and light as SAI with all the functionality of bulky photoshop.I would love to see a more focused direction though. Having all this functionality can sometimes get in the way of whats important in a program like this. Getting straight into the work with clear intuitive controls and minimizing any bumps that get in the way and allowing the user to get a hold of the full functionality with little effort. I find that less clutter and more user control via hotkeys and slidders the better. This is aimed at visual people after all. I would also like them to take advantage of modifier keys.Thankfully they are adding the ability to switch between brushes with hotkeys. No information on when that will be, but it's this kind of functionality that speeds up the painting process. Less time fiddling around in tool windows and more time spent with your eyes on the canvas.The dev's have been very attentive during the entire early access process of this software. I've personally provided lots of feedback that I've already seen results from. A big thumbs up to this dev team and the fact that they do care about the user and want to shape Krita around our needs. Gemini already came in with a good foundation of standard features that you expect to see in a digital painting software. So theres a lot to build on for them going forward now. It still needs a lot of work and I hope people will continue to provide usefull feedback. Krita Gemini has really benifited from the early access.;2 April, 2014;

But still this world lacked efficiency and neatness.World 4.A multiplayer world with my friend in which I forced myself to be neat, tidy and efficient. Also having to explain the games mechanisms to someone helps you understand it even better. I only made it as far as fuel generation as the save was on his PC.World 5.This is my current iteration, I've created one of the most efficient worlds I ever thought possible. Wanting to get to a level where power would no longer be an issue, I only used the cleanest methods I knew.I'm now at a point where I'm attempting to make race tracks around some fun parts of the map with moving obstacles and pretty visuals.This game is more than conveyor belts, there's so many elements to it, you can play it in many ways, whether it's for efficiency, for cleanliness or if it's just for the joy of what the game has to offer.This has quickly become a staple of my regular plays, the fact it's in early access and has so much to it, makes me excited for what's to come next.If you are on the fence about buying this game, do it, it's very straightforward and the game helps you every step of the way and then you can start deciding what you want to invest your time and efforts in.I can't praise this game highly enough, they've gone so hard with the graphics, it's a visually stunning game.The mechanics are simple and have the potential to be satisfyingly clean depending on your play style.The enemies add an extra level of challenge and as you upgrade through the tiers you develop new ways of taking them on.Seriously get this game, it's one of my faves, thank you Coffee Stain and keep up the good work, can't wait to see where you take the game next!;6 June, 2023;

Eternal Return;A;NOT INFORMED;148 people found this review helpful20 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 150.9 hrs on record;"I really want to love this game. I play it everyday and will continue to do so for a bit, but the strain it puts you through requires some kind of masochistic tendencies, which apparently I possess.The core gameplay and the mechanics are extremely enjoyable.The game runs well. It is generous in its distribution of currency so you can gain access to the characters that you want to play.It has a practice mode where you can play and try whoever you want before purchasing.The cosmetics, the map, the events are all incredibly generous for a Free To Play game.The characters and the balance of the game is actually pretty good, and the top characters generally switch out almost on a daily basis due to how well you can play. Although there are certainly some characters that are stronger than others.The core and foundation of Eternal Return are so freaking good for a smaller company.However, the biggest and most disappointing thing about this game, and why I, despite really enjoying it, am not recommending it is due to its absolutely awful matchmaking.I am simply trying to learn and get better, but often times the lobby I am put in has, quite literally, the best players in my region that proceed to, as expected, annihilate the entire game.Often times, the response to this would be, ""But you're learning how to play better"" or ""Get good"" or whatever.I'm no stranger to failure having played the Dark Souls/Bloodborne series nor am I new to the MOBA genre having played way too much League, Dota2 and HoTS.Now, the frustration and quite frankly, disheartening learning curve would not be so bad if the population of the game was anywhere viable, but it is not. And due to no/poor marketing, the que times for a normal game take about 5 - 20+ minutes. Hell, even 30+ minute ques are often the case.You can see why then the lobby you finally get into, would be frustrating, as you sit and wait for about 15 minutes, only to play for about 4 minutes because you encounter, literally the 7th best player in NA right now or something along those lines.This process happens. A lot. To the point that this is often the norm, not the outlier. Like I said, this learning curve wouldn't be as frustrating if I wasn't waiting for extended periods just to die. It's not fun for most people. And it's killing the game.Because if you don't float, you sink. And people would rather leave and go play something more enjoyable than sink.There is no ""Matchmaking"" system put into place for the normal game modes.There is however, matchmaking for ranked, but ranked is only active during very specific times, and if you are at work, at school or can't make it that time, well, you're out of luck because then you will sit in the ranked que, for literally 3+ HOURS without finding a fair Ranked game. So if you want to play, tough luck, you have to go into normals where you have a very high chance of encountering 1 - 3+ players in the region who will, let's be honest, curbstomp you because it is more akin to playing against bots due to how new some people are.This is the state of the current game. It is entirely disappointing because what keeps me playing is how much I absolutely enjoy its core foundations and gameplay. The GAME in itself, is very very good. It is gorgeous, it is interesting, fun to understand and plan out builds. When you get a fair lobby and the matchmaking WORKS, it feels like you're playing the game. It feels like you learn, even if you place very low because you understood what you did wrong. All of that is incredible and Eternal Return knocks it out of the park.But unfortunately, that is just not the case 90% of the time. You will get killed in 3 minutes, after waiting 15 minutes for a game, without understanding what's going on or what you did wrong, simply because the person that killed you is just, so much better than you, that you have no idea what you did wrong or how you could improve.It's like matching a professional Chess Player, like Magnus Carlson, one of the best players in the world to someone who's only played one or two games and then asking the new player, ""Are you having fun? Are you learning? See how you could improve?"" Except Magnus Carlson would probably take the time to try and talk to you.Eternal Return just ????? you and leaves you feeling ???? about yourself.I guess I'm a masochist.

Start with AI lobbies so you can better understand the core gameplay. the 1.0 release has added a lot of QoL features for newer players, and made the game more fun to play. Also make sure you enable voice chat it is off by default for some reason... If you want to know what items to build on a character, or what skills you should level go to dak.gg. most of the stuff on there is very helpful.On the removal of the solo game mode:90% of the current negative reviews are because they removed the solo game mode. A lot of people will tell you that they removed solos because of their investors, but what they won't tell you is that before 1.0 you could only find games consistently from around 8-12pm est in team modes and every other time of the day the game was nearly dead... Even solos had times of the day where you couldn't play at all. Them funneling everyone into 1 mode has successfully made the game playable at all times of the day. Not to mention the balance of the game has always suffered from multiple modes. If the playerbase grows it's likely they will add solos back, but people insist on crying on here, increasing the chances of new players not trying it out. Many will see ""mixed"" for recent reviews and assume the game is bad, but it's really just the old players being unable to cope. I played solos myself as well, for all it's problems it had its charm. I'm not saying it is good that it was removed. They made this decision to save the game, as it's clear they were not making money and could not sustain the game in its current form.

My friends and I have submitted tickets in with suggestions and they actually listened to our ideas and have changed some things like adding paper and changing some gameplay issues. This is such a great thing for a beta game as they change to the audience. Gameplay / Difficulty The game can be hard to get into definitely which might steer you away from the game but put some time into it and you'll find yourself having fun. If you're a micro / macro fan then this game has a lot of that, you can have multiple builds for a character that you choose from and you path in game to get items for your build. There's tons of items and path choices you can choose from that you can experiment and try new builds. Also in game, there's things such as consoles, bushes, all that so positioning is important. There's also tons of tiny things like food, animal drops and timers, Wickeline, traps, switching gear, mastery exp. As of right now, they are currently releasing new characters every 2 weeks or so, so you'll always have some new variety to play with and experiment with. Currently in NA, the ranked queue takes years to find games unless there's an event going on for it. Tips & Tricks ? When playing squads, try and find routes that line up with your teammates by zone 3 atleast. ? In any mode, find plans that get your weapon by zone 2, zone 3 is acceptable. ? Find some food that aligns with your path (like alley you can make hot ramen / garlic ramen)? Don't try and fight early unless you have your weapon and they don't or you have an item advantage. Fighting early isn't always bad but it wastes so much time in getting efficient routes? Improve routes (find items that are similar in your path so you can move to the next area, some areas are nearby that might have the same items so if you don't find your item, you can go there and get it) Great with Friends The game can be really annoying and frustrating especially in solos. Griefers, more people that kill you, paths and items being taken in your path, etc. In Squads and Duos, there's some leeways like being knocked down,;17 February, 2021;

Dead Rising 3 Apocalypse Edition;Wanech;225 products in account;84 people found this review helpful; Recommended 26.0 hrs on record;"Hi folks, there are some things you should know before you pick up this awesome game.First off, the game is capped at 30 FPS. This is very easy to fix, and I'll explain how:1. Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\deadrising32. Create a new notepad document, paste ""gmpcr_unlock_frame_rate = True"" into it.3. Save as, title it ""User.ini"". Make sure it is saved as ""All Files"", so that it registers the extension.Now you can play the game at 60 FPS, but I highly recommend that you cap your FPS at 60. Otherwise, aiming and other stuff will be messed up.Next up, there is a rough save bug in this port. However, I've discovered a pattern and it is easy to avoid once you follow these next steps.When the game first boots up, it will ask you to specify your gamma/brightness for the first time. Remember, if this EVER comes up again, your saves DID NOT LOAD. If this happens, just hit okay or whatever the prompt is to ""set"" your gamma, and then close the game out and re-open it. You can test this, because if you go to load your game you will see your progress display as if you are level 1. When you load the game up and it DOES NOT ask for your gamma setting, your game likely loaded in properly - but make sure that you actually read the display for your progress before you load. I have not experienced an issue when following this pattern, but as a precaution I decided to back up my saves. The directory is as follows:C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Games\Dead Rising 3\savesJust copy that entire folder and set it aside each time you want to back it up, and if anything goes wrong next time you load it should be okay to paste it back in. From what I've read, when your saves get screwed - they get screwed for good so overwriting the screwed saves should be okay.Also, if for some reason you have trouble with the FPS - turn LOD to the minimum. I can play on max with that at the lowest setting, but it grinds my game to a halt if I crank it up. It will probably add some pop-in, but I don't mind it.All that aside though, this game is amazing. I've played a lot of zombie games and I can't believe that this one flew under my radar. It's been such a blast and I highly recommend it.";20 April, 2021;

You’ve officially unlocked your frame rate, and you can now enjoy the game!And one more note: If the text document doesn’t change after adding ini, make sure that file name extensions are turned on by going to View on the top of file explorer, and checking extensions to be enabled! It’s as easy as that!;27 April, 2023;

Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition;Hououin;NOT INFORMED;716 people found this review helpful16 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 123.7 hrs on record;Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. I've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. The story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. The combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. I might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. Speaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. To Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. I really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.;18 August, 2023;

You seriously did a good job and were turning the tide in your favor.

Response to DL points a few weeks back was easily the most backlash this game has seen. Despite knowing exactly how we felt, you still went ahead and implemented a tedious, half working monetary shop that is designed to be incredibly predatory to nickel and dime your fanbase even more.I always looked up to Techland as the developer to set examples and break standards in the gaming industry.

Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition;DontLookItUp;NOT INFORMED;763 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 30.4 hrs on record;The developers of the original Modern Warfare 2 (the 2009 one) said that they ran into a problem after that game, because it was fundamentally an incredible game... but nobody knew why. Thus, they couldn't replicate that magic, because they didn't know what caused it in the first place.I feel that Dying Light 1 create this same problem. In many ways, DL2 is fundamentally superior, with smoother animations, more zombie variety, more fleshed out character upgrades, and a more developed, interesting world. It has it faults as compared to DL1 (no grappling hook and no guns come to mind), but in most respects, it should be the superior game to DL1... but it's not. There's simply a magic about DL1 which they couldn't replicate this time around. DL2 is fleshed out and well made. It's not buggy or un-optimized, and Techland certainly did enough with it to claim it to be its own AAA game. But it's no DL1.Is DL2 worth buying? Sure. I got my money's worth out of it and don't regret buying it. But don't go in expecting to re-live the magic of DL1. Think of it as its own standalone game, and you'll probably have a better time.;21 April, 2023;
Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition;heatedfrogger;NOT INFORMED;1,153 people found this review helpful16 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 32.1 hrs on record;"I started Dying Light 2 having been a huge fan of Dying Light 1. Let me refresh your memory about Dying Light 1:Dying Light 1 was a wonderful experience that I put about sixty hours in to, and I enjoyed almost every second of it. The dialogue was cheesy, the plot had holes, yes, there are legitimate criticisms you can easily levy at DL1, but I would still overwhelmingly recommend it because, above all else, it was fun. The combat felt fantastic, with real weight to your swings. The parkour made you feel agile and, once mastered, gave a real freedom to your movements. There was variety in the environments, with a pleasing amount of verticality. You were free to ""grind"" to increase your power almost to an unlimited level. And night time felt different - you were genuinely at risk at night, because it brought out much scarier, seriously powerful zombies who would tear you limb from limb if they caught you.It's worth setting the scene like this, because Dying Light 2 let me down on almost every count.I didn't expect the story to be any good. there's no pedigree of decent storytelling here. But the devs have shoehorned in an arbitrary choice system so you can ""fundamentally change the world"". But there isn't actually a branching story tree, they tell the exact same story regardless of your choices, but they have to work the plot around whether you decide to let a few characters live or die - the result of this is that you are left with an impossibly generic story with utterly forgettable characters. Sure, the story is terrible, but DL1 wasn't exactly good. It made up for that with fantastic gameplay. So how does that compare here?In short, not well. DL2 manages to miss the mark in both combat and parkour. The combat feels cartoonish. slapping a zombie or a person with a wrench makes a light bonking sound and often barely staggers the target. It feels a little bit like you're hitting people with foam weapons - until you randomly land a critical hit (which is in no way influenced by an accurate strike, such as to the head, and so doesn't feel rewarding), at which point you will decapitate them, or literally cut them in half with the same weapon that they were completely ignoring a moment ago. I think the developers were concerned about how powerful it was possible to get in DL1, and to compensate, levelling now requires picking up a collectable (inhibitors) rather than purely being earned from experience. And they gate the availability of these inhibitors behind map progression, and thus story. Enemies in each subsequent area therefore get harder at the same rate you do, and so this removes any actual sense of progression or power scaling - it takes the same number of hits to kill a zombie at the end of the game as the start. Except it sort of made sense it took three to five hits to kill a zombie with a rusty pipe you've picked up in desperation at the start of the game, and doesn't make much sense that a ""legendary"" rarity machete that you've modified to both shock and burn takes up to five hits to kill a VISUALLY IDENTICAL zombie. The only difference is that the small number at the top left of their health bar is higher. At least in DL1, as tougher zombies were introduced, they were visually distinct (and you were free to scale as you wished).The parkour is unfortunately not a redeeming feature here either. In DL2, the movement feels wrong, somehow. You're too floaty, you have no inertia at all. You can jump too high, you can spin 180 degrees at full sprint. It just doesn't feel like any of your movements are particularly deliberate or consequential. The streets are just a little too wide. you can't jump across them without having to catch yourself on the edge without using a specific skill, and using that skill drains your stamina, so you can't string freerunning across the city without stopping. In DL1, freerunning across the city was a joy. the buildings within a district were usually of subtly different heights, so you're navigating vertically whilst moving across rooftops quickly - this kept the running engaging and fun. In DL2, the buildings are the exact same height. You only have to actually do any parkour to jump across a street when the row of buildings you're on has run out. In the second area, buildings are suddenly extremely tall, and this feels immensely promising. But they then immediately introduce the hang glider... This tool (until upgraded) is immensely slow and unresponsive. It leaves you floating slowly in the air as you drift towards your target, but you have absolutely no option of getting around any other way. And once it IS upgraded, you can fly at a reasonable speed more or less indefinitely. So movement has gone from DL1, where you would climb a building, run across rooftops, leaping between them, navigating up and down as you went, with buildings also built on hills and slopes, with destructible roofs and surfaces that make noise and attract risk, to DL2, where you take a lift to the top of the nearest building, then glide directly to your target in an uninteractive way. Techland has tried to make DL1 again. They've changed very little about the game and added a few additional features, that, on paper make it more fun.But all they have succeeded in doing is removing the joy from the experience of playing the game. Fans of DL1 will absolutely be able to play through the game. I did, it took me 30 hours of sporadic play. But when I got to the end, I was disappointed, and all I could think was ""man, Dying Light 1 was a fun game"".";26 July, 2022;

Not only am I blown away at how the reworked combat, gore and parkour feel like a more satisfying, roided version of the predecessors. but many parts of DL1 I enjoyed so much like bounties and events have returned too.I think it's safe to say that we're in for a support run as good as Dying Light 1's was, and hopefully this shapes up to be the ultimate chaotic fun zombie game.;5 July, 2023;

I can honestly hardly call this a sequel. It feels like it's trying way too hard to be a CDPR game while at the same time also trying hard to be Dying Light, as opposed to a fully fledged sequel to the latter. Chris Avellone's presence in writing the core of the game's lore and world building would've required at least another 5, maybe 7 years of extra dev time and FAR more resources and manpower to develop than Techland already has. His departure from the team and subsequent rush to finish the game had led to extremely huge plot gaps and pacing issues. The following will sum up the things the game does good and bad, especially as a sequel to it's rather sublime first game.The good:+/- The game's map is gargantuan, easily dwarfs Harran and then some. Plenty to explore, feels like a giant Mario level, tons of secrets and easter eggs. Downside however is that just about every dark zone is a literal copy paste, and there are also no Volatile nests at all barring maybe.+ Story and sidequests are quite long and girthy, my first playthrough of the game thus far where I chugged through the story and did a fair amount, but certainly not even half of the side content, took me 65 hours. I had assigned all of the utilities to the factions and done all the bandit camps, and a handful of dark zones and anomalies.+ Soundtrack is great.+/- The parkour. I'll go into this in a little bit more detail further ahead.+/- The combat. Again, will go into more detail ahead.Now for the bad:- The main story. Without spoiling anything, the story is decent in premise, but executed horribly. As mentioned before, there are plot gaps, and horrible pacing issues, especially evident in the epilogue (which sucks MAJORLY by the way.) The core narrative of the game that Avellone tried to establish felt way too ambitious and Techland did not have the manpower or resources, or time to realize its full potential. - The dialogue. The voice acting isn't bad for most NPCs, though it felt like they got some rather average or below average VAs for a lot of their NPCs, it was largely due in part to the script writing in general for the NPCs that sucked. Dying Light hardly had this issue, but with how DL2 is trying way too hard to be an RPG without actually being an RPG, a lot of the NPC dialogue has been really poorly written, almost as if the person spoke very little English at times. (Yes I am aware Techland is a Polish game studio.)- The atmosphere of the game and world. Dying Light had a much more gritty, horror theme to it with an atmosphere more appropriate of the period the game world was going through. This sequel meanwhile feels more or less like how Bethesda handled Fallout 4, it's not gritty anymore, it has far less horror in it, and is more fantastical (especially thanks to the more saturated color pallet) and makes it truly feel like it isn't a sequel to Dying Light but rather either a soft reboot or spiritual successor to it.- The skill and world progression. This is partly tied into how the parkour is in the game, but the skill progression in DL2 feels way off and you get access to some really odd skill choices early in the game. What's even weirder is that the main character supposedly wandered the European wasteland for 15 years and knows almost no parkour or advanced moves off the bat. Part of this makes sense for game reasons, but narratively it makes no sense whatsoever. As for the world progression, the cool thing DL1 did was that it started off with some light, easier infected and slowly the world around you became more dangerous as more people got infected and turning, with more monstrosities being introduced over time. DL2 just throws everything at you right at the beginning. In this case, narratively it makes sense because it's some time since the world succumbed to the infection, but from a gameplay perspective it just feels wrong.The so-so's:+/- As mentioned before, the parkour. They refined quite a lot of elements and made climbing a lot more fun and fast, as well as riskier + more reward thanks to adding in a stamina system, compared to DL1, and is the most fun I've had in a long time with a game that has advanced movements, possibly the best I've played thus far, trumping that of Breath of the Wild and then some. Downside however is that the jumping and movement also feels a LOT more floaty. The first ability you unlock is an increased jump height, and you can also unlock an unrealistic double-jump as well as an ability to turn 180 degrees mid-air. DL1 was a lot more like Mirror's Edge with regards to parkour and jumping, but DL2 basically turns you into a discount Spiderman, in all the best and worst ways.+/- The combat. For the same reasons as the parkour, combat is better and worse at the same time. There is far less gore, and they removed the cool X-ray animation that DL1 had when you landed crits on anyone, and it feels a lot floatier as well. On the upside however, fights against human NPCs and zombies are a lot more interesting because you can chain some neat and effective parkour attacks and stunlocking isn't an issue anymore.-------------------------------Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you don't care much at all about the story and you haven't played the first game to base a lot of this stuff off of, it might do quite well as a standalone game, but as a sequel, it suffers from a LOT of drawbacks. This is essentially what is in my eyes:The perfect 7/10 game, no more and maybe room for less. A sidegrade, rather than an upgrade or a downgrade, with lots of nuances that set it apart from the previous entry.EDIT: Included a bit of formatting for easier reading.";21 February, 2022;

Grim Dawn;eGregious;NOT INFORMED;264 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 622.2 hrs on record;"It is important to note that Grim Dawn is an indie game. Aside from the engine itself, the majority of the game's systems were designed and programmed initially by only two people, with the help of a bunch of part timers, and eventually forming a much larger team after a successful kickstarter. This is both a good and a bad thing! Despite the limited resources, this is very much a concept piece with tight design, systems that knit together perfectly symbiotically with no ""bloat"". This is a fantastic game.Those coming over from Diablo 3 or similar ARPGs, however, might find themselves overwhelmed at first. Both a potential upside and downside to Grim Dawn is that it doesn't put restrictions on you for training wheels. You are unleashed into the full skill tree with barely any knowledge of what you should do. Make no mistake - you will spend about half your time ""playing"" this game poring over the trees, the wikis, trying to figure out combinations and what works best, particularly if you've not played this type of ARPG before. That IS part of the game, and can be enjoyable in its own right, but to begin with, it's extremely confusing. The first time I saw the Devotion system, a series of additional perks and stat bonuses on top of your regular progression, constructed as a kind of astral maze, my reaction was ""WHY IS THIS NECESSARY!?""Having spent enough hours in the game, I can still honestly say that something similar to Devotion but without the brain???? could easily be achieved. In that respect, Grim Dawn is almost complexity for the sake of complexity. It's the antithesis to the design philosophy of the new Diablo 3, and it's easy to see why the fans are so vigorously vocal about that - it's almost a political statement about the way games are designed. But you could also make a strong argument that learning and navigating that maze - like the skill system - is part of the game itself and its lasting appeal. Whether or not that appeals to you will be entirely a matter of taste.It's unfortunate that the game doesn't feel quite as tight and kinetic as its AAA cousin, Diablo 3, but honestly it's a very minor complaint. It still feels fun to play for long monster-smashing sessions, but more in the sense of watching your progression and XP climb. it just lacks the visceral appeal and feedback of a true AAA action game. But the devs have done a pretty fantastic job nonetheless, and I still find it more satisfying than some of the ""floatier"" action games like Yakuza. What's more, they continue to improve. the first expansion, Ashes of Malmouth, introduced the Inquisitor mastery, which feels very suited to running and gunning. In the second expansion, Forgotten Gods, they've added a huge number of movement abilities like teleports, dashes and leaps, enhancing that all-important ""action"" element to this action-rpg.The Faction system is not quite as amazing or sandboxy as it sounds in the sales pitch (are these things ever?) but I found it extremely satisfying, nonetheless, to watch my faction reputation climb and unlock new rewards (and on the opposite side, the hatred of my enemies climb until they began sending their ""nemesis"" hit-monsters after me). It's an optional element to the campaign, but after the story is over you'll find yourself coming back to grind out reputation and unlock the essential augmentations that factions will offer. The systems all feed symbiotically into each other, building the ideal breadcrumb trail of gameplay so that you will never run out of things to do - at least not until you have a couple of hundred hours on a character. But if you like this game, you will certainly get addicted to creating new characters, playing with new masteries and builds.One of the last things I expected about this game was to be impressed with the story. I generally play games for what they are and rarely ever actually appreciate a game's story. But Grim Dawn's lore is impeccably written, with just enough suspense and intrigue packed into every dropped note to make you eager to find the next one. You'll want to find every secret of the world, and the devs have been devious in hiding them. The main story is not quite as good, but that's not what I want from a game like this. I want it to feel like a game, not a film. For that, this emergent and bitty style of storytelling is perfect, and keeps you interested without interrupting the precious gameplay.Finally, loot. Unfortunately I found the loot in this game to be far too numerous, dropping piles of crap and forcing you to play Inventory Management Simulator 3000 every 10-15 minutes in the early game. This lessens as the game progresses and you unlock more bags to hold stuff, and as your gear becomes fairly good. I also began using the loot filter to simply ignore the lowest two tiers of loot, opting only for rares and above, which made me feel like I was throwing away a lot of money and potential gear upgrades, but simply made the game less tedious and more fun. This was improved with the free update that accompanied Forgotten Gods, which introduced a more complex loot filter so that you'll only see gear that pertains to your particular character type - no more having to sort through manually. Far better late than never!If you've read this far, then you've probably got a good idea of whether or not Grim Dawn is for you. Despite my criticisms here, I've had a blast playing Grim Dawn and consider it to be the best ARPG on the market right now. If it's what you're craving ... you'll not find better than this.";8 March, 2019;

Once you get there, start scraping your ship to collect material to establish your first base. From there, the world's your oyster. Expand the base, make mining vehicles, explore the planet, set up outposts, ... And when you feel ready, make a rocket, and take off for the stars. If you're lucky, your rocket will be powerful enough for you to leave the planet's gravity well, and you'll be ready to make your first space station! Then of course, you will need a new space mining ship, a shuttle to get back and forth from planets and moons, a mothership to store your stuff and your ships, something to defend against pirates, ... And I haven't talked about the multiplayer yet.Just writing this review makes me want to play some more.";28 May, 2017;

Implicitly, the evidence is there for some types of people (looking at you, Lego fanatics and Minecraft nuts!), but if you have an attention span that has allowed you to get this far, BUY THIS GAME! I can not remember a game I am so eager to starting up like SE, every time. Fair warning, the learning curve can be quite daunting (as many hours as I have logged, I'm STILL learning stuff!) and the build time, depending on settings, may take hours to months to build. However, when you hear that ""woosh"" sound from your Gyros kicking in, and the hum of those engines when your ship leaves the station for the first time, its all worth it. Everytime. There will be your fair share of ""WTF?! moments"" but they are character building experiences at this point relatively for me because this game runs amazingly well now compared to earlier versions of the product. Also, the SE groups I have come to know makes me think that SE is one of the least toxic environments I have ever played in for any length of time. 11/10 recommendOh yeah, and watch for Klang...Lastly, Keen, Marek, and our amazing modding community: Thank you for all of your hard work This is the game I have waited my entire life to play!

Let me explain.All games I play I start on the hardest possible settings. I dislike easy mode because bad habits and the real intent of the developers never shines through. (The devs need to make games easy for some people because they're either time-poor or effort-poor and well, their money and wishes are just as important right?)And this does that. In SE, easy mode doesn't teach you anything. It's a ""Lego meet Asteroids"" style and some even called it for a ""Minecraft"" clone as a result. Add building block. Add another block, and another ad infinitum until you have spaceship. For me, it got boring quickly. It's called ""creative mode""- just... build.And then there's survivor mode - on hard. Whoa!! I struggled for the first few hours. With little in the way of documentation and no real clue as to what to do, it took me over an hour to work out how to build a single block from the remains of a craft crashed into an asteroid.First there's survival. Have I got enough uranium for power? Should I turn on the gravity generator? How can I save energy until I can salvage enough to.... live?I need to mine. I NEED fuel. I can mine using my included hand drill but it's... messy. Slow. Trite. So to mine I need a mining ship. To build a mining ship I need components. To make components I need an assembler. To use the assembler I need steel. I need glass. I need energy. And all I have is a drill. I have a grinder. I have a welder. And in my scenario, I have a ship I can salvage. Piece by piece with a grinder, all the while careful of my energy limit, my inventory. I need a refinery. The refinery is needed if salvage doesn't give me everything I need so I'll need raw material to convert to ingots, including uranium ore which I convert to processed uranium to fuel the reactor so I can do ALL these things.Do you see where this is going?To build my mining ship I need a mining drill. To build the drill I need motors, steel etc. Some of these can be salvaged. Some have to be made. Every component needs to located, transported, linked and welded. EVERY component. You need a plan. A rough sketch on what you intend to build helps alot. It gives you purpose because time is of the essence. if you're not watching and run out of fuel you're.... dead. No energy means no refining of uranium ore to refuel. It's a grind. And a weld. Yep. Grind and weld. Hour after hour floating in your pressure suit. Maybe you can leave the grav gen on and walk around, expending more of that precious reactor fuel. Who knows. The decisions you make determine what you build and how fast it's going to take.The flying is... space like. There's 3 dimensions. There's gravity. There's velocity. There's death. There's no attitude indicators, sky markers, ""horizon"" indicators, compasses or such. Fly too far, lose your bearings and home.... disappears.";4 May, 2014;

art of rally;Glaide;NOT INFORMED;130 people found this review helpful32 people found this review funny; Recommended 45.3 hrs on record;You come to in a carpark in Finland. Given the glare, the hangover is implied. Your in-game father, a giant, low-poly golden Buddha statue, phases up through the ground, gives you a short history of the noble and eponymous art of rally, warns you about trees and then, just like your real father, ????? off until you've made him proud.You promptly floor the accelerator, wildly overestimate your skill level and chuff yourself into a ditch. Neither of your fathers are proud.But you try again, regardless. The road ahead of you winds, bucks and narrows, outraged that you'd dare try to traverse it - or at least, travel it without the proper respect. You're thrown off. Glumly, you read the fun slogan on the bottom of your car as it sinks into the Sicilian ocean.You try again. Funselektor makes trying again easy. The music swells and pulses, four hours' worth of bounding synthwave that begs patience, calm and focus as it weaves and spins. like Gandalf on rollerskates. Like a real life Gandalf on rollerskates, it is irresistible and you follow it, and try again.You book it into a fir tree. You try again.You misjudge a jump and cartwheel past impassive cows. You shame them and yourself. You try again.You entirely underestimate the stopping power of a hay bale and lose valuable seconds doing a 13-point turn. You grit your teeth, and try again.On a rainy night somewhere in the Japanese hills, you perfectly drift an 80s Volvo around a hairpin. You are aroused for longer than four hours and need to phone your doctor.You learn to fear Germany and the precision its landscape demands, but love its automotive children.You learn to take your eyes from the car below you, positioned, as you are, as a phantasmal observer high above yourself - out-of-vehicular-body experience entire - and watch instead that distant horizon, reading it like an augur. You might be moving in the present, braking and sliding around the current corner, but your mind is two turns ahead, six seconds. you are racing the future.At a certain point, you will realise that you've been reacting to the pitch of your car's engine, listening as it instructs you when to lift off the accelerator, so that you can clip the apex of the corner and still be facing the right way to floor it into the next. There will come a time when you fight not to make up seconds, but shave off milliseconds. art of rally is a language, and you have become fluent.You come to in a Finnish carpark, blinking owlishly at your screen. The HUD tells you that you've just finished a stage, but you're not entirely sure which one. the wave of the music, the rhythm of accelerate-brake-turn, the hypnotism of that ever-moving horizon has lulled you and you forgot you were racing. You weren't even really thinking. The leaderboard puts your time in the top 5% of drivers. That is the art of rally.Somewhere at least one of your fathers is proud, probably.;28 October, 2021;
art of rally;Armitage;NOT INFORMED;56 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 16.2 hrs on record;Almost gave up early but glad I didn't. First starting out, it felt like the controls were wooden and stiff, the cars were unresponsive, and the camera angles were always messing me up. I couldn't control the cars, kept crashing into things, and generally wasn't having any fun.Having stuck with it a bit longer, I came to realize that the game is closer to a sim than an arcade racer and the physics model is heavily focused on vehicle weight transfer. After that, the rest fell into place.Hints:- Control problems? You're probably using too much throttle and not slowing down enough for turns. The physics engine punishes you for constantly flooring it and rewards you for easing into the throttle and using part throttle in a lot of situations. - The brakes are exceptionally strong on all cars on all surfaces. Use them!- You don't need to Fujiwara Takumi every single turn.- Understeering in a slow corner? Lift off the throttle entirely to get the weight back over the front tires.- The game punishes you for crashing. Even the lightest collision almost always results in a 180 spin. Avoiding offs in the first place is the best strategy. - Loss of control and pendulum-ing all over the place? The camera lags behind the car's movements, and amplifies the situation. Lifting off the gas prevents the pendulum effect.- There are no pace notes and sometimes you can't see the hairpin or decreasing radius turn coming up ahead. Discretion is the better part of valor.- Hate the rainy stages? They're the perfect place to practice your throttle control and tons of fun once you get it down.Things I like:- Charming aesthetic- Nice variation in levels and cars- Music selection- Once you get a hang of the physics model and start putting it all together, it becomes super rewarding to chain together an entire stage of perfect corners. Stick with it!Nitpicks:- Camera lag / sometimes you can't see what's coming up ahead- Occasional performance problems / FPS drops- Cuts are allowed but sometimes the game questionably resets your car when you're only a few feet off the road; 4 February;

art of rally;Sly_Reflex;1,057 products in account;66 people found this review helpful; Recommended 37.0 hrs on record;Art of Rally is an odd but enjoyable game that does a lot of things right, but also gets a few things wrong. Let’s go over them.First of all, let's go over how it looks. Personally, I think it’s beautiful. It’s gorgeous to look at, doesn’t really matter what car you pick or which track you're driving, it is consistently stunning to look at. In an age where driving games are all about photorealism, this is a breath of fresh air. I know it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but aesthetically I think it’s right up there with some of the most striking games I’ve ever played.Sonically it’s also very well crafted. The cars sound good, the effects from driving on the various surfaces provide feedback as well as sounding great, but the real star here is the soundtrack. It’s nothing short of phenomenal. It’s perfectly pitched to those real life broadcasts where you’d see Subaru’s and Lancia’s diving over crests and kicking up gravel as they sped past. I’d go as far as saying the soundtrack to this game is immaculate. Even if you don’t buy this game, go check it out on youtube or spotify. It’s fantastic.Gameplay is mostly good. You have the general options you would have for rally games, as well as a story mode that sees you rally across stages and rallies that gradually get longer and harder with faster and faster cars over the space of when rallying emerged as a sport right up to the mid to late 90’s when Subaru, Toyota and Mitsubishi vying for podiums.There are several maps of which stages are built from, all of which can be modified so that the races can take place in the rain (or snow), in the fog, at various times of the day and night. It’s what you would expect really.Surfaces include dirt, gravel, snow, ice and asphalt as well as wet versions of all of these. They all drive as you would expect. A personal preference is that I’m not keen on the tarmac based ones, I have the least fun driving these rallies but I can see why they would be someone's favourite.One thing I do not like at all is levels that have rain on them. I think they are a tad difficult and could do with toning down. I groan whenever I see them in legs of a rally I need to complete. They are like driving on skid pans with how slick they are on top of having puddles liberally scattered that make them a complete chore to play. These levels should be a bit harder but should be an exercise in seeing how sideways you can keep the car rather than struggling to keep the car on the road.Another down I’m going to give the game here is that going off the road sees you reset and eat a 5 second time penalty. Rally is about cutting corners wherever you see them and the game feels so inconsistent on where it will nab you for going offroad and will not seem a little harsh. I think if the driver wants to go off road where it looks like they can, they should be able to. If you do not want the driver to cut, prevent them from doing so with obstacles.Speaking of which, there’s very few obstacles in this game. Roads narrow and widen, but it’s not often you see ditches either side, or have to go through gates or anything like that. There are things like hay bales to slalom through but it would be nice if there was more variation to the scenery.Talking of the scenery. Some of it is destroyable and some of it will bring you to a dead stop. This also seems very inconsistent. If a car looks like it should smash through it, it should be able to smash through it. Yes orange plastic netting barricade, I’m talking about you.Also on the track are spectators, which add a well needed bit of texture to driving. It’s very exhilarating to drive through a crowd and watch them narrowly avoid being hit by a 150kph chunk of metal, but there are occasions where they obscure a corner and it can lose you time, especially as this game features no pace notes.I am sort of bewildered why there’s no mud to drive on, sure you have wet dirt, but it’s not the same. Effects for driving over certain terrains are missing as well. It would be lovely if driving in the dirt of the deserts you kicked up a huge dust cloud behind you. I think this may have been cut to maintain performance? Seems a bit odd it’s missing.Car selection is great. All your favourites are here and present. You can even mod in decals for them. I am sad that we don’t go any further than the 90’s as there are some classics that came after that era, but it’s really hard to be disappointed at the vehicles that made it into the game, as well as the cleverly named “off brand” names. Same goes for the real life parodies of the drivers from each era you’ll go up against, a lot of love and care was put into a knowing nod to past legends both vehicles and drivers. It’s clear to see a lot of knowledge about this wonderful sport has been captured with a tongue in its cheek.Finally I want to talk about performance. For some reason this game runs like butter for the first 30 to 60 minutes of you playing it, and then it starts to micro-stutter and get unsustainable to play as it chugs about. I think it has to do with the game loading between rallies or something, but it really shouldn’t be doing this and it can and will hamper your enjoyment, especially in those long play sessions where you start to get into the zone.Overall I give Art of Rally a thumbs up, it’s a nice game to play while you wait for friends to come online or for a quick 20 minute hit of gameplay, but it doesn’t come without its problems and you should consider those when making a purchase.I do hope that Art of Rally makes a sequel and squashes a lot of issues I mentioned, because overall I think it could be a fantastic skill based time waster if it ironed a few of its kinks out.;22 December, 2023;

I played both Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero from the beginning of their early access launches.According to Steam I have played:Subnautica- 100+ hrsSubnautica: Below Zero- 60+ hrsIt's so hard for me to let go of the hope of this game being something more than what it is turning/turned out to be. To be philosophical for a moment, we are more disappointed with something that gets close to the target than we are with something that misses it completely. To me Below Zero is a large step back from the original in the ways that made the original so special. Which is a heart wrenching thing to see. I will break it down more but first I want to make sure that you, the reader of this knows that Below Zero is a good game. It's beautiful and engaging. Like the first game, it is one that is hard to stop playing. Also like the first game, Its base loop of resource gathering a tool creation is well paced and gets you to explore farther and dive deeper to find those valuable resources.Where Below Zero falls short is in its understanding of what made the first game amazing. It is a survival game. There are A TON of survival games. But how many strictly underwater survival games are there? When the first Subnautica came out I think it was the only one. Yes it has some out of water roaming in it but it was very minimal. The atmosphere was also incredible. It takes place on an alien planet so there isn't any people roaming around. Aside from some logs there isn't any form of human life. To add to the isolation the radio guy says they are gonna rescue you and then they get blown out of the sky! If that doesn't make the atmosphere seem desperate then sprinkle in the fact that all other survivors are eaten before you get to them and you have yourself some edge of your seat suspense. Next, the first game has a huge open world. For an indie game, it's HUGE. Lastly, the survival loop was great and you really progressed to the point where you felt like a master of your domain. Yes, you need to avoid those leviathans but the game really gave the sense that you started from nothing... and now you are driving around a massive submarine!To summarize:1. Isolation2. expansive underwater world3. Eventual dominion over that worldWhen I look at those 3 things, they really are the base of any survival game, except for the underwater part(the unique trait of subnautica)Now looking at Below Zero.1. ISOLATIONYour character drops onto the planet on purpose. so right off the bat it's not about survival in the mind of the player character. Then there are audio logs everywhere. The first game had logs like I mentioned but they didn't have audio which adds alot more personality to the characters but takes away from any sense of desperation or dread. Also, there is a voice inside your head that your converses with, again removing a sense of isolation. Lastly there is a human NPC in the game, which makes you physically not alone. So the strange alien world I was in felt a bit more homely that I was anticipating when I started playing.2. EXPANSIVE UNDERWATER WORLDThe underwater portion of this game is significantly smaller than the original, like 25%-33% the size(my estimation). Also I'd estimate that 25%-33% of Below Zero's entire world is on land. Which means they removed 25%-33% of the world that made the game unique from all other survival games. Yes, the land is still on an alien planet. But there are plenty of run around survival games on alien planets. I can't help but think of what it would of been like if that 25%-33% was put into the underwater world. Another amazing biome or 2 could have been added. Oh man...sweet, beautiful underwater biomes...3. EVENTUAL DOMINION OVER THE WORLDI was waiting for a giant sub like machine to be introduced into the game. The sea truck(which is a small sub) is fine, but it hardly feels like a sea conquering machine. While you do progress and climb the ladder of dominance it end really quickly. You find the sea truck withing a few hrs and then you made it. That's it. You get attachments for the sea truck(a cool idea) that lets you explore farther and longer. The attachments are things like more storage or an aquarium for storing food. But by adding attachments the truck its movement speed is reduced significantly so I usually have 1 attachment and go back to my base when I want to swap(cause the underwater world is so small it doesn't take much time). If I really need to have access to food and storage(among other attachments for the truck I wont mention) why can't I use the great base building mechanics and build small bases around the small underwater world? That would eliminate almost all of the benefits that the truck provides! I walk away from this game confused and sad that the developers didn't see what made the original so amazing. It's almost like they went in the opposite direction. I hope Below Zero does well because they are obviously very talented people and I want them to succeed. I also want them to try again.Side note. Below Zero is $30!? You guys should rethink that.;1 March, 2021;
Subnautica: Below Zero;bees;NOT INFORMED;308 people found this review helpful20 people found this review funny; Recommended 39.0 hrs on record;"It's Diet Subnautica, not Subnautica 2.Had I not played the original Subnautica first, I would have thought this was a pretty great game, and likely wouldn't have had any issues with it at all. But I did play the original first, and that set the bar for my expectations -- especially given that the two games are the same price.It's gorgeous. The coding is tighter, the animations are smoother, it is WAY better optimized -- no more chugging and chunking while distant objects struggle to render. The weather effects are great, and the addition of temperature as a survival mechanic is neat. There is a lot of new lore (with an interesting cast of characters), plenty of new flora and fauna to scan, great new base building pieces, and a lot of new decor options.Now here comes the bad:The map is TINY compared to the original. And extremely shallow -- you can go almost everywhere that matters with the first depth module for the seatruck and a bit of free diving.The survival elements feel poorly balanced. I got the tank upgrades very quickly, and never felt concerned with hunger or thirst thanks to slightly overtuned edible plants being so easy to access, and food/water being in so many of the numerous crates scattered across the map.The progression curve feels flat compared to the first game -- the upgrades come too quickly, and don't feel as rewarding. The Cyclops allowed you to go DEEP. Well, there is no ""deep"" to explore, here. And no reason to do so anyway, as all the endgame crafting materials are very plentiful and are able to be picked up very early in.You unlock some things at weird times. Some too early (like the multipurpose room), some too late (like the decorative plant walls -- which you can only scan from one specific area, despite encountering them in more than one place).You are able to scan a lot of new plants, but the ones you can actually take seeds/samples from and grow for yourself are EXTREMELY limited. Why? Even if they were just decorative elements at your base, with no other use, that would still be SOMETHING. There aren't many creature eggs to find, either. It almost feels like the game was pushed out early, with less content than originally planned.Props from the first game are used as decor in the second game, but are unable to be scanned or picked up (all the lab equipment, many island plants). This makes no sense to me. The assets are already there, in use in the game world. Slap an inventory icon on it and let us use them!There aren't many uses for the spy pengling. At all. It could have added a lot of exploration value, but it's mostly a waste of inventory space. Same for the snowfox, which I used approximately once and then discarded -- it really needed to be able to hover on water, to make it worth zipping around on.There aren't as many leviathans, and they aren't as scary. The game in general isn't as scary. I never felt alone. I never got lost in an utterly black void, a cave system some 1000m down, unable to orient myself and running out of air, water, or flashlight battery.The player character legit sounds like she is edging a big fat orgasm when she eats (UNNHHHH, MMMMM, AAAHHH). There is no way someone didn't bring this up during playtesting. It is absolutely ridiculous.Overall, it's fun and polished enough (and I got it cheaply enough) for me to give it a thumbs up. But if you pay full price for this and expect it to be just like the first one, you're gonna be disappointed -- there just isn't enough of it. Once they finish backporting the building elements from this game into the original and fixing up the older code, I'll never touch this game again.tl.dr - Super pretty, but it feels like a DLC, not a sequel.";9 July, 2022;
Subnautica: Below Zero;sophistry;1,135 products in account;200 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 81.0 hrs on record;Tough call. I agree with the reviewer who said this is a good game, but not the game they wanted and hoped that it would be. It feels like DLC, not in terms of the amount of content but in terms of how quickly you chew through it, and I think if you go into it with that fixed in your mind, it'll have a better 'feel' for you -- maybe play it immediately after playing Subnautica, without a break in-between.I think I'm sort of the odd one out in that I don't actually hate the sea truck, as many people seem to. If the cabin were slightly smaller and more nimble like the seamoth, less prone to getting clipped on sidewalls and rolling, I wouldn't think there was anything wrong with it at all -- it's mostly the compact, cabin-only mode that frustrates me in that way. And sure, it might be nice if the storage module had more storage, but honestly, the smaller world means that less available storage on the move hasn't felt like a huge problem for me. Being able to drag a fabricator around with me is pretty nice, too.For me the weirdness comes from two places, and I have a theory as to why they might be related. The first is the pacing: everything is vastly accelerated. The progress you make through the tech tree and the story is really rapid. The biomes are much tighter, so maybe that's part of the reason why -- you're spending a lot less time traveling from one place to another, which could be a good thing or a bad one, depending on how you feel about it all.The other weirdness for me -- and maybe this is just me, idk -- is the feeling that the biomes themselves have, maybe as a side effect of how compact they are. They're really beautiful environments, and I think a lot of love went into them...but I've hit a weird wall in my playthrough. I can't figure out where to set up my Big Main Base, the one I'm going to pour a lot of time and resources into, because all of the locations that look like grand set-piece locations, all of the places you might want to put your base and build it out so that you have some cool stuff to look at through the many new glass ceilings and other transparent elements, aren't designed with your base-building in mind. Every time I run into a spot with a killer view or a convenient location there's another structure there already, or it's too narrow and tight to accommodate player structures in any way that makes sense, or there are significant predators that are going to casually destroy my stuff every time they swim by.It's a weird feeling after the last game, where my late-game base was located in a spot I felt was custom-made to give players a fantastical spot to live. Combined with the dizzyingly rapid tech progression, it almost feels as though Subnautica was designed from a place of envisioning how the player would experience the world for the first time, and Below Zero was built from a place of constructing a world for the player to experience, thinking mostly about the world itself.**I'm not a dev and I'm not going to pretend that I know whether or not this is true, or what approach was taken -- I'm just saying that in thinking about the differences, this is the closest I can get to articulating what feels different to me.The bottom line is that this game still has most of that great Subnautica flavor, and if you liked Subnautica you'll enjoy most of what Below Zero is. It's beautiful. It sounds great. But you'll be happier if you don't expect it to be the same expansive, slow unfolding of mysterious mysteries, and resolve to enjoy it for what it is -- a variation on a theme, compressed in many places, but trying to offer you a few new things in exchange.;19 March, 2021;

The classic subnautica released to early access and has grown into a very complete and well made game. Take this game, early access, is releasing at, imo, an even better state than compared how the original did. I can see this game being taken very far and I am very curious to see how it will turn out. The artic setting is beautiful and even though the food fish and crafting items seem to be very similar, it seems to breath in a completely new life to the game. Great stuff;30 January, 2019;
Subnautica: Below Zero;JackLetz;NOT INFORMED;340 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 77.4 hrs on record;So far this game is awesome, but I have to say that there is one element that I am highly disappointed about. When I think of an underwater ocean game, I think of going deep under water because it makes things tense. In the original subnautica you could go around 1800 meters deep without going to the border drop off. Once I saw that they were making a new game, I was expecting them to make the game a ton deeper but instead they pretty much halved the maximum depth from the original game. This was so disappointing to me because it doesn't give me that feeling of being so far separated from the surface like the original game did. While both games are terrifying, I personally think the original wins because that feeling of going so deep down was one of my favorite aspects of the game and they took it away on the new one.;5 October, 2020;
Subnautica: Below Zero;ditzy;NOT INFORMED;278 people found this review helpful; Recommended 51.0 hrs on record;"Below Zero was a truly wonderful experience for me after Subnautica, but you may want to be prepared for some differences. Without going into spoilers, I think the important ones are:1. The story is very different. Do not go into BZ expecting the same emotions as Sub. As an analogy, Alien (1979) was a horror film, but Aliens (1986) was an action film. Both are exquisite, just not the same genre of story. BZ is not ""action"" to Sub's ""horror"", but the stories are very different energies like that.2. The setting and technology is not the same. BZ is not just another story in the same setting. It is the same planet, and there are a lot of familiar elements, as a result, but the location and technology are different in many ways. I won't give specifics, just don't expect to navigate the map in the same ways, or experience the same kinds of dangers.With that said, I want to talk about some of the other reviews and address many of their criticisms for folks who haven't played the game yet, to give you some context. I feel that many other reviewers are unreasonably expecting a sequel to magically recreate an experience that was dependent on everything being new. If you played Sub, then you already know so much about the setting. BZ fundamentally cannot be the same experience, but that does not mean it can't be incredible in its own way. That said, many of those other reviewers sound like they really power gamed or min/maxed Sub, and if you're that kind of player then their reviews may actually be helpful for you. But if you are in it for the story, and aren't trying to unlock literally everything before completing the game, then my comments may be helpful. My points above already address several criticisms, but here are some more specific ones (very mild spoilers):1. ""These vehicles suck. Sub vehicles were better."" -- for Sub vehicles, I can't think of a single bad thing about the seamoth, it was wonderful, but the cyclops and prawn suit were pretty awkward and restrictive. But I didn't even care. They were just what they were. I loved my cyclops and prawn suit. I lived with the awkwardness and embraced what was wonderful about them. BZ vehicles are no different. There are good things and bad things about them. I don't think their shortcomings are any different than Sub vehicles, they're just different.2. ""The map was so much more confusing, and important stuff was harder to find or more hidden."" -- I literally had to look up a guide to finish Sub because I couldn't find a key item. In BZ not one single blueprint or item that I actually acquired was as hard to find. They weren't just sitting in the open, but it wasn't in some secret cave I wasn't going to find without a scanner room. Both games do have an element of randomness in the form of how much you actually just explore your environments. I got stuck a couple times in BZ looking for some blueprints, but I just went to the places I knew I hadn't explored yet and easily stumbled across the blueprints. Same as in Sub. But hey, you can also just use scanner rooms to find stuff. That's what they're for.3. ""The story is a mess."" -- I truly have no idea how people can say this. Maybe they played an earlier build that was different (if early builds were even that different), but the story I experienced in the first 2 weeks of Jan 2022 was perfectly coherent, understandable, and enjoyable. Not everyone is going to like every story, that is incredibly valid, but I think the story is far from a mess. Sub's story was incredible, and I was really affected by the end. Well I loved BZ's story and how it ended, too. As I mentioned above, it's a very different story, so you may not like it, but I think it's wonderful in its own way.4. ""The world isn't as spooky/scary"" -- I think there's a minor element of truth to this, but I also think folks are taking for granted that they learned to deal with a lot of scary elements by playing Sub. First time going to many areas in BZ were real scary to me, but once I realized what the dangers were, and got to see all the creatures, I quickly fell into late stage Sub energy, where I could travel around pretty freely without worry. Sub just taught me how to handle those fears. The only exception is the big leviathan you have to contend with late game, which I always treated with a healthy amount of extreme caution.Hope this helps someone.";13 January, 2022;
Subnautica: Below Zero;you;NOT INFORMED;1,194 people found this review helpful15 people found this review funny; Recommended 66.1 hrs on record;Compared to the first Subnautica, I feel like there are numerous minor improvements in this one. The most notable being the fact that it feels far less grindy when gathering materials. Materials are spaced in a much better fashion and are not nearly as annoying to collect. There are also numerous sections that are designed for you to have to navigate without a vehicle early on using plants that give about 30 sec of oxygen and take time to recharge that add a lot to the feel of the game. The AI for many of the creatures also appears to be significantly better than in the first game, although they still run into walls. There's a much heavier focus on story in this one as well, and the writing is quite good at times. I overall think this game has much more interesting designs on many of the creatures (although others fall flat), but it has nothing on the scale of the Sea Dragon or Emperor from the first game, which I found disappointing.There are also quite a few things this one doesn't do as well as the first game unfortunately. I don't know if there are actually less creatures in the world, but it feels as though there are. Some environments feel just as interesting as in the first game, but others feel very bland once you spend some time in them. The crystal caves at the end have fantastic visual and level design, but aside from the (very cool) shadow leviathans, there's nothing new or special about the area really. It mostly contains the same creatures you'll find in numerous other locations. The following red crystal area is even smaller and more disappointing in that regard. It's just one big loop effectively, with the same creatures as the preceding area for the most part. Squid Sharks are particularly cool in my opinion, but they get heavily overused. The shadow leviathans are awesome, but they effectively just fill the same role as ghost leviathans in the first game. The other major ocean threat leviathan in the game has an interesting design, but doesn't even begin to inspire the fear that the reaper leviathan does in the first game. There are also few less of them than reapers, which leads to most of the ocean feeling relatively safe, which is a shame.The place where this game suffers the most is the place where it deviates the most from its predecessor - the land gameplay. It's simply not very good. The animations on land are still very stiff and there's no option to crouch. The snow fox is cool, but flips easily and you'll spend half the time getting knocked off of it by the ice worms. The ice worms themselves are too on the nose and lack any real suspense. I was never afraid they were coming - it was obvious they were and they were more of a nuisance than an actual threat. I thought the land environment was very interesting and well designed, but the gameplay just doesn't support it well. There are numerous mechanics that work great under water that just don't translate (or look good) on land.Overall it's a great game and I would recommend it. But, I would recommend the first one more. During the first part of this game, I was very immersed and was even enjoying myself more than the first game, but after only a short time it felt very small. Without an equivalent for reapers to box you in, there's really not much you can't just go explore very quickly, and it's far less scary of a game once you get familiar with it. There are also no major events like the Aurora exploding or the Skybeam (or whatever it's called) getting shot down, making the game feel less active as it progresses. The later areas are far less mysterious and interesting than the final zones in the first game. The alien sites are much less impressive and much less interesting, which is a shame considering the focus on alien sites in this one.;13 May, 2021;

This game stands alone on its features. its graphics are stunning, its music is grand, and the overall feel of the game is that of an old school RPG. If you are thinking about getting this game because you feel it is a stardew valley clone, ask yourself these questions: 1) what is it about Stardew Valley that I'm wanting more of? If it is the farming, this game has a more varied and intricate farming gameplay loop. Is it the story? This game has a story is a traditional RPG story with different races, peoples, cities, and cultures. Is it the combat? This game's combat is more intricaite than Stardew Valley.But despite each of its features expanding on the best features that we've come to love in Stardew Valley, this game is not a sequel. It does not play the same, it does not have the same feel, and it will not scratch the simplicity, slice of life that Stardew Valley did so well.Once you realize this, as I did after 25 hours, you'll come to love this game for what it is and what it isn't.; 12 June;

No Plan B;A;NOT INFORMED;14 people found this review helpful; Recommended 6.1 hrs on record;A solid 7.5/10 for now.The gameplay loop is very satisfying, kind of like a mashup between Phantom Brigade and Door Kickers. However, the planning phase itself is a little clunky to the point of frustrating. As the game allows you to build and intricate and complicated plan, it becomes a messy jumble of line that is too easy to misclick, and potentially ruin your entire operation when overlooked. I suggest a lock feature where you don't keep clicking on another character plan when you're already planning for a single character. As right clicking is tied to where you want them too look, it's too easy to right click into an already laid plan and thus pull you back and forth between characters. It becomes frustrating when you have a bigger team of 4+ unit trying to scramble in a cramped space as you keep on changing plans between units. As the planning makes up the entirety of the game, the clunky controls really makes the entire experience more frustrating than it should. Other than that, there's already a decent amount of content in the game, and i'm looking forward to potential new weapons/equipments in the game, maybe a body armor system?; 4 April;
No Plan B;Wondervice;NOT INFORMED;190 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 8.2 hrs on record;"It's close to being great but sadly there are too many things dragging it down.The game's main gimmick is in the name: ""No plan B"", meaning that if you fail a mission, you have failed the whole chapter of the campaign. You can only influence the game in a planning session, in the actual mission your units will follow your pre-set instructions, have almost zero incentive to act on their own and you cannot give any more commands.To make a game like that really work, you need to give the player very specific, very detailed information, as well as a reasonable way of predicting how encounters go.This is not the case.The problems start with the unit and gun abilities. The descriptions are vague and multiple stats you can advance not only have no description but don't even show up anywhere. The in-game help section is completely worthless.You are also missing crucial information about basic actions. What does cover do? What's the hearing range of a gunshot? What's the accuracy falloff of your guns outside ideal range? All of these you can only guess, but guessing is expensive: no room for trial and error since ""no plan B"".The thing that finally made me stop playing was the enemy AI. It's almost non-existant, but sometimes behaves in erratic and unnatural ways. Sometimes they run towards a fight, but then think better of it and just stand there, on the other side of the corner from your operative who also just stands there, no one shooting, no one advancing.If one of your men is downed, there is no way to redirect anyone, so whatever that one was doing is not getting done. This will easily result in a lost mission, because enemies in a room or even in a corner will just stay there, not caring about you slaughtering everyone else.Also while graphics and presentation are fine, the UI is very finicky. Both the timeline and the map are a bit clumsy to use, and it is very easy to ruin your plan with a misclick, which you might not even notice. And if you do... well, there is no plan B."; 6 April;
No Plan B;Alf;NOT INFORMED;54 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 6.4 hrs on record;I am blown away by just how good this game is. If you're wondering if you should buy No Plan B if you've already played Door Kickers or other similar tactical strategy games, you definitely should. Here are the things I like:- The interface is extremely intuitive and easy to use. The game starts with a few tutorial levels which quickly gets you up to speed on the controls and interface.- Each mission is first planned out in one of those tactical kill houses that squads like SWAT would use to train. The way that you select ops and then drag the timeline back and forth to determine who should be where at which time feels incredibly natural. I'm sure all other games like this will copy this method going forward, it's brilliant and makes it fast and easy to set up a tactical plan.- Once you confirm your plan, the tactical kill house is replaced by the real location and your squad will execute your plan. It is incredibly satisfying to watch, and you can easily create action shots of your assault if you like.- The meta game is great too. Fatigue carries over between campaign missions, giving you a reason to not deploy your entire squad in every mission. Likewise, any lost equipment, injuries or deaths carry through as well so your decisions feel like they carry real weight.- You can also buy new equipment and get skill upgrades for your squad.All in all this is a great tactical strategy game that is well worth the price. The dev has a good track record (e.g. Gladiabots) and even though the game is in Early Access it feels pretty feature complete.Highly recommended.;3 December, 2021;

No Plan B;???;NOT INFORMED;23 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 17.3 hrs on record;"-This review has been updated.. Quite a bit of time has passed and i decided to check out new features.11-8-2022The things I like... 1) It's a poly game, I really like this art style. There is a lot of customization for your squad. You can change the smallest details all the way to what type of pouches they have on their vests and even the ranks you want them to be, gender, uniforms, etc. Every faction has different guns, which is kinda cool. Just sucks if you prefer playing as SWAT & want them to be armed with scars over m4s.(check #5 on the cons though because a lot of the customization options mentioned here are only for SWAT faction.) 2) The planning involved in this game is amazing compared to any other ""tactical"" game I've played that is semi-simular. Like these scenarios are ""1:00."" Yet you can spend 15+mins, to over an hour trying to perfect your breach. 3) You can't see the enemies during planning. Meaning you have to actually check your corners & have your guys cover each other just like in real life. 4) love the different camera perspectives. Things I don't like... 1) Missions have a timeline limit on sandbox mode.. Personally I like to play the campaign missions on sandbox.. It helps me learn the game, yet I still have to make all my moves & my units have to do the objective in 1:00. Speaking of that after the tutorial you get a few choices on what to do next. When you try to play the campaign the game tells you to try skirmish instead.. I'd prefer the game doesn't tell me how to play it. There is a sandbox mode. Where you get infinite money & skill points. If there is a way to learn that is the best way. The popup message is not needed.2) In the campaign you have 8 units... I want 16... Why? 8 for squad 1, 8 more for my squad 2. Since mission fatigue is a thing. Or just let me turn off the fatigue... Again I'm in sandbox mode, I'd expect the stuff I'm complaining about to be in hard or permadeath. 3) The tutorial covers most of the game, yet the part it doesn't tell you, is how to get to your teams loadout... You literally have to start a mission then put a unit on a breaching point, then you get a loadout selection screen... By default my brain thought ""these guys are unarmed, I'm not going to put them on a breach point."" The loadout should be available in the squad customization section. Along with buying new weapons. Again if we had more then 8 guys we wouldn't have to waste ability points on building a sniper, just to change him to a shotgunner or something later. 4) The damn tutorial videos... They were fine in training mode, but when I'm playing the game, trying to do stuff, and an unskippable pop-up video blocks the right of my screen it frustrates me... I haven't seen an option to turn them off either. 5) SWAT has a lot of customization, then as you select other factions the options become less and less. Men are required to have beards... Robbers, if you change the body type they are men wearing skirts?... You can't change the hair styles separately from the body type. I feel like the outfit menus need a full rework. Instead of type, name it gender, then add outfit style as a category, and overall give us more options instead of taking them away. Every faction feels lacking compared to SWAT, and even on SWAT you can't change the gloves if you are on the second body type. I mean SWAT can change uniform color and everything. Robbers, gangsters, & FBI get like no options. Issues I noticed... 1) During planning, when you are trying to get your squad up to a different floor, the game doesn't allow you to hold shift & quick select a point upstairs for your guys to go to. Trying to get them to go to the floor above is really difficult for some reason, they just don't want to. Sometimes your guy will decide to travel all the way to the bottom of the staircase again, rather then climb a few stairs... Blame the doughnuts? 2) if you hold shift then select an unopened door that is past another unopened door, you can end up with a glitch that spams like over 50 little boot icons (screenshot on my profile.)... Doesn't seem to affect anything, and undoing the move removes them. It's just inconvenient.3) When you are planning and creating paths for your units to follow even though you don't order a pause, a random pause gets placed in the path sometimes. I haven't found out how to remove them yet either. A simple delete option (without resetting the entire plan) would be nice. 4) A good chunk of the maps snipers seem to be pointless... Meaning you waste some of your ability points building them. 5) Name a full squad, delete the squad, then recreate the same faction. The outfits save (thank god) but the names do not.Food for thought... I am probably in the majority, nobody else is probably saying add more units. They don't want it to be too easy, right? Yet irl SWAT would have more then 8 people + however many cops are on scene outside. It is just a game, but it's a game with sandbox mode & map creator... I would like more freedom. Or at least, more options on stuff outside of the building. Like police units outside of the building that can setup snipers and stuff etc, that cost in game currency. This type of stuff would work for everyone except maybe the robbers. Where yeah being restricted to 8 makes sense. Unless the robbers have resources like payday 2 robbers, so calling in favors would still make everything I said relevant. FBI & SWAT being separate units is odd to me.. FBI & SWAT are the same thing... Like sending in a criminal minds investigator vs a SWAT trained operative is absolutely redundant for most of the missions in their campaigns. I think you should take all the customization options from the FBI or SWAT and add them to the other, then merge the campaigns. The deleted one could be Delta SEALS, SAS... Any counter-terrorism unit. Or just make a different faction all together. Conclusion... I recommend this game if you like top down strategy games, or just being able to control units in general. I think it was well worth it's price, maybe even worth more. It's basically ready or not, but less not then ready. Since it's still in beta, heh get it?... Anyway I find this game unique and I want to see it do well.4-7-2023 1) A lot of customization has been added to SWAT... Everything else i have stated above is still the same with how other factions get less and less customization options.. The other factions seems to be neglected to the point to where i could ask why they are even in the game? However the weapon customization is new,, and it's actually really great & it's diversity carries to all factions. I still hate that i have to put a unit on a deploy point just to change their appearance. This seriously needs to be added or moved to the squad customization section. Even if i could just customize how they look without putting them on a deploy point i'd be happy.Overall besides a few new customization features, basically everything else I've said is the same. I'll leave you to interpret that as you will. Thanks for your time. :)5/9/2023i tried to play this again. Biggest issue i have is when creating a path the unit i'm trying to make go somewhere does not make a straight line, and he stumbles on his own feet, sometimes walks in a circle. This was always an issue in this game, but it has finally annoyed me enough to where i needed to added it to the review. We need an update to the path editor where it doesn't delete the entire route just because the game decided to make my unit backtrack for no reason.";8 October, 2022;
No Plan B;campaign;NOT INFORMED;11 people found this review helpful; Recommended 97.3 hrs on record;No Plan B is a planning / tactical game that remains both simplistic and complex. While the scope of a given mission appears small on the surface, moving through it as such will usually end badly. This is not an issue on single missions or challenge maps for those that want to play one off and risk free missions for a quick match or to learn the game. (quick mention i have played exclusively on linux via proton and have had no issues so if that is relevant to you, now you know)I really enjoy this game and it has filled my time for when I wanted to sit down and do more long planning and precise missions, or just load up a single mission and draw a rough plan and see how it plays out for a quick match when I'm looking for a more quick and action oriented session.; 29 February;
Hammerting;Xenoun;397 products in account;162 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 25.0 hrs on record;"After playing for 25hrs and beating the game with a ""Diplomatic Victory"" I'm not recommending others buy the game in its current state.There are many MANY minor issues that add together to make an overall frustrating experience. The ""heavy micro"" problem others have said isn't really true, its just what one youtuber said so the pack picked it up and ran with it.The real problems with the game stem from:- The standard mountain size is too large. There is too much space to explore and too little variety filling it up. I had 1600+ mountainlore sitting there at the end of the game with every upgrade unlocked.- The war on the surface is pointless. You can repair your allies fortifications but forget about helping them get armies out. Your contributions to their food or weapons do so little that the un-aided enemy can keep up easily. So get ready to sit there an repair their walls for hours on end until they eventually capture a city...and go immediately into a truce.- Due to the above point the only way to win is to get max rep with all the surviving factions. I had 3 allied factions in the end....makes me feel less like I made a choice of who I wanted to support and more that I just had to do it to get the game over with.- Due no doubt to the size of the mountain, once you hit around 15-20 dwarves your entire supply chain starts to fall apart. I sat there for 30 minutes on fastest waiting for my dwarves to plant a crop that they had haulers, farmers and plants available to do. The crop was even set to ""high priority"" with a yellow triangle on the craft symbol. IT TOOK 30 MINUTES. The AI needs massive improvement to make it workable and remove the feel of micro managing.- Too little direct control of the dwarves to be able to take over when their standard AI fails as mentioned above. I could have solved bottlenecks in seconds if I could override all commands on one dwarf and get him to do one critical step rather than hit a feeble high priority button and watch as the dwarves do tasks that have a lower priority.- Trading with the other races is tedious. Even when using the trading window you have to scroll through the entire list, hunting for every scrap of hide or whatever it is you need at that moment. Add a filter, add a search bar or something ffs. Let me type ""hide"" and it filters to all items with ""hide"".- The dwarf buildings get very large and the ""grotto"" areas become impassable roadblocks. Have one spawn where you're expanding into? Too bad, you can't build there. Let players cave-in the grotto's and build over them. They serve no purpose other than aesthetics.- The HAMMERTING. The thing that shares its name with the game!....is utterly useless and pointless. It feels so lacklustre, the bonuses are pathetic and have zero impact on the gameplay. Want to know what has more of an impact than the bonueses? The time your dwarves spend when you do the hammerting and they all run there and talk for ages. - Some buildings are almost entirely useless. Arcana and Tailor have one or two things you need and then....forget about them. The healing building doesn't get any new recipes from the start of the game. Want more advanced medicine? Use a random shrine that spawns....forget researching something using higher level materials.- The higher level materials don't feel like they make any impact at all. Nothing changes when you get orichalcum, or tomb lotus or diamonds...you can just craft another thing that makes some kind of difference but nothing that is readily apparent to the player or has any impact on gameplay.- Auto-equip upgrades doesn't extend to rings and armour. WHY NOT!!?? Holy crap is it tedious to go through 20+ dwarves and check their 2 rings and armour. So guess what, I didn't do it and it made 0 difference. Raises the question of what's the point of having that mechanic?Edit: don't know how I left this one out as it's my number 1 frustration- When harvesting crops the dwarves do not reserve a plant to re-harvest. So you'll be sitting at 100-200 mushrooms for example and go ""yay I can use those for food/yeast etc now"". Then 30 minutes later you have a crop of mushrooms with a red ! across it because they've used all the mushrooms and now you have none. Begin the process of pausing everything that uses mushrooms, hunting down more and re-growing your crop. While the crop bit might sound annoying...now imagine after encountering that and trying to control it you then have it happen 3-4 more times with mushrooms, twice with sugar beets, 5-6 times with gloom wheat....until you just give up and rush the win condition so you can be done.I could go on even longer with this but you get the point. So many frustrations with this game. It needs more dev time. It needs polish. It needs someone to stop and have a hard look at what the systems are doing and what they're trying to accomplish because right now it plays like an indie demo, not a full release game deserving of a mid-market price point.";20 November, 2021;

Let me be clear on the unfinished part, there are still placeholder tools that do nothing but are clearly intended to be used, there is a end game goal that doesn't actually do anything, there is no balance to the tools, weapons, food and most buildings have at least 1 useful thing they do while having a host of other things they can do that have no use or produce a higher tier item that has the same stats as the lower one (see unbalanced).

Hammerting;Reginald;NOT INFORMED;246 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 172.9 hrs on record;I stopped playing this game when I realized I'm only playing it because I want something like it to be good, rather than because it _is_ good.There is a ton of micro needed that really shouldn't be there - Having to manually manage scaffolding or dirt block removal because the dwarves will remove the closest one, preventing them from removing the rest? In a game largely about digging? Or only being able to mark ~10 blocks to be dug out at a time in a direction because you can't mark anything beyond your field of vision? Or manually adding upgrades to individual dwarf homes when it's normal to have 10-20 dwarves? This game is filled with tedium.There's also almost no actual pressure in the game - swarms aren't a threat, and you can block them out trivially with a few placed blocks.Each additional update should be a clear improvement, but they've been hit or miss, and they (at least recently) have missed the mark at actually making the game better - they just make it more complex. The game didn't need relationships between the dwarves, and, even after a release focused on that, they don't actually seem to matter to your settlement. Adding farming in the dirt (instead of it being in a building) now makes farming something that you can't manage the same way you do all of your buildings' work. Epic crafting (leveled gear) is neat, but no one is going to buy this game for RNG-driven leveled crafting. In the mean time, the only win condition is amassing a truly enormous amount of money (again, only achievable through tedious repetition), because the devs removed the main story line 6 updates ago.Did I mention this game is leaving early access in a month?;20 October, 2021;

Hammerting;badminton;636 products in account;57 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 46.1 hrs on record;I don't like recommending against a game, especially when there's caveats, but since it's not early access anymore I feel like it's fair.Hammerting is the stereotypical result of a studio of artists and level designers making a game. Behind the beautiful aesthetics it's just a mess of over-simplified gameplay and unnecessarily complicated systems. It's full off odd decisions like the talent tree. The stats system is great, the talent system is great, but why are there are so many talents that boost irrelevant stats? The tiers in the talent tree make no sense either, they don't get any stronger as you work your way down. I understand that the effects are cumulative but why do I have to unlock multiple paths to get max boosts to whitesmithing? And why do my whitesmiths have to unlock stonemasonry and farming skills to progress?Research is even more messy. Advanced Casting (metalworking), Complex Stonemasonry and Woodworking are all tier 3 but you can't build the large foundry without unlocking woodworking and stonemasonry first. So if you spend your points thinking that iron weapons and tools might be nice then congrats you just soft locked yourself and now you have to focus on exploring until you can get enough points to unlock the other two. Oh, and you can't unlock masonry without first unlocking... farming... and arcana...? Dwarfs starving at the beginning of the game? Oops you have to unlock the almost completely useless early game tech of fishing before you can learn to cook a simple meal. Cave farming doesn't actually farm anything anymore, it's just a way to get water for free. If RNGesus is good to you then maybe you can get some wheat, which you can't use without unlocking... fishing...?The overworld is a bit of a missed opportunity too. There's no reason to have to map fogged out at the beginning of the game, all it does is arbitrarily limit the trading you're allowed to do, which is already extremely limited and very tedious. Why can't I just build a trade hub in my mountain and set up automatic routes to get the stuff I need? The war is basically meaningless because I don't care about any of the above ground civilisations, none of them are a threat and once a town is captured and rebuilt it's trade as usual with just a change of flag. Sometimes you get good prices for things so a town can rebuild but your gold already builds so quickly it becomes a meaningless number. Dwarfs should be the peacekeepers, if one faction becomes too powerful they should attack the player and trigger a loss rather than have the player win the game. That way you would always have to walk the tightrope of helping out the underdogs to maintain the status quo instead of just befriending the winner. Things would have to happen more slowly so the player could keep on top of them, but they could have quests to send dwarfs on diplomatic or combat missions to give a decent boost if things start to tip too far in one direction.The UI needs some tweaking too. Things like making sure the professions are in same order for every dwarf, as would having the appropriate modifier at the top of the attribute and talent tool tips (some stats improve a skill by +1 and some by +2, in the tool tip for attributes and talents these seems to be in a completely arbitrary order, just put the +2 at the top and the +1 under those for easy reading).Exploration is heavily encouraged, but largely unfulfilling. Once you unlock drilling machines ore is essentially unlimited and a single tiny patch can feed your fort indefinitely without the need to explore for more. The places you find are as beautiful as the rest of the game, but mostly meaningless. Deeper ore makes stronger or more expensive items, but the game is easy and gold quickly becomes meaningless so... why am I digging for it?Those are most of the (hopefully) objectively inexcusable problems I have with Hammerting. The caveats to my negative review are mostly subjective things like how easy the game is. Comparisons to Craft the World are unavoidable, but there's genuine conflict in that game that takes genuine strategy and work to overcome. Hammerting is extremely sedate by comparison, which is great for casual gamers who just want to watch their ant hill grow. The problem is that Craft the World also has a far more flexible building system that lets you customise your ant hill in fantastic ways. Hammerting looks amazing aesthetically, but the variety between your subsequent forts will quickly approach zero. They've tried to add a thin layer of customisation to dwarf rooms, but they all have the same upgrades that go in the same places.In conclusion: Craft the World is superior in basically every way. If you want something to doodle around with while you watch something on a second monitor then Hammerting might be good for you, if you want a rewarding challenge then maybe not so much. I alternate between the two so I'm a bit ambivalent about posting this but ultimately there are better doodling games out there and better challenging games out there than this one. I hope they keep developing it because it seems a bit half baked at the moment. Thanks for your time.;27 November, 2021;

Get up to 35 dwarves. Starts lagging horribly. Dwarves won't make ""mushroom oil"" or ""leather"" for me. At all. Even when I have the materials. Dwarves stop eating, stop cooking, stop healing. Buy a ton of food from the overworld. Spiders attack, but dwarves still don't eat, still won't heal. They are all running around with 5 hp or passed out from ""low moral"". Spiders one shot all of them.These devs are hands down the worst devs on steam. This game is a joke. Oh, they made the overworld pretty? Dwarves can talk to each other now (which does nothing practical)?The AI is trash and if they haven't updated it by now, they aren't going to. Also at 30ish dwarves and a big base, the latency is unbearable. I'd stream this just to show how garbage the entire game is, but at this point I've given it more attention than it deserves.The only, single pro I can give it: I'm honestly shocked this isn't abandonware yet.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT #1: Big new update, reinstalled to play again.First thing that happens is I sell some stuff to the overworld (granite, etc.) to get a bit more gold to start with. Turns out, this sends ALL MY DWARVES to the surface, to run back and forth from town. BUT they can only carry a few things at a time. You used to could sell mass amounts and it be done fast. Not anymore.My base with only a small foundry and quarry was then attacked by slimes, both buildings broke, and I didn't have the blocks to build another quarry which is the only one to progress.The new update ended my run within 5 f*****g minutes.Uninstalled, blacklisting. Will not recommend to anyone, ever. No one should fall for this scam. The devs are actually making it less enjoyable. Take it off your wishlist and play something good and fun instead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Put on your wishlist, wait until AI is drastically improved. The Dwarves are so unapologetically stupid it single handedly makes this is a DO NOT BUY warning for anyone that's thinking about it.They will literally fall down on level and sit there, starving. You have to click them, manually move them over to one side, manually click them to climb up.They will leave the quest items next to the chest and not load it. You'll lose a quest because the timer runs out, with the last item you needed just.... laying on the floor. I'm not sure if there is a way to manually select the dwarves to pick up specific items, but even if there is a key binding, that is something the UNITS SHOULD PRIORITIZE ABOVE ALL OTHER TASKS.Its literally the end of the world above ground and your dwarves will make the good guys lose a full battle because they were short one ingot, but not only that, it was ALSO more important for your dwarves to do literally any other tasks instead of helping save the world.It is a pretty game and scratches the Dungeon Keeper itch, but it ends up being a mostly frustrating experience more than a fun one.Also, MAKE THE HOMES HOUSE MORE THAN ONE DWARF. Another annoyance that stands out in a sea of annoyance. Maybe they will make it work one day but right now do not buy it.EDIT: Gave it another shot, had a pretty good size mountain going. Then my dwarves just.... stopped working. All of them. The AI just broke completely.RIP. Devs say they want to work on this, but make them fix it before you buy it.";21 November, 2020;

NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution;The;NOT INFORMED;31 people found this review helpful; Recommended 26.4 hrs on record;"Story - 3/5 A lot of people say this game doesn't have a story. My explanation to this for people looking to buy the game is that, yes the game doesn't follow the Great Ninja War story arc where the series left off at the end of Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. BUT it does feature two well-written, somewhat anime accurate story tidbits in the form of the Ninja Escapades (The third Ninja Escapade is just a 5-minute cinematic with no battles whatsoever) and an exclusive Mecha-Naruto storyline. If you are interested in how the Akatsuki was founded and why or if you want to learn about why Itachi had to do what he did, these mini story elements are really fun. I have only given the ""story"" 3/5 because both Ninja Escapades and Mecha-Naruto storyline last ~3 hrs at best compared to the ~8 hr storyline in a full-fledged entry in the Storm series. Graphics - 4.5/5 The graphics have an extremely vibrant, anime-esque art style, that kinda appeals to me. Quality-wise it fits in right between Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 and 4. The latter of which was one of the best looking games of 2016 imo. Roster - 4/5 A key element to consider when evaluating any fighting game is the roster. This game doesn't disappoint with its massive roster of 118 characters. DO NOT take this figure at face value though, as Bandai Namco has a very loose definition of what qualifies as a ""character"". You will find around 4-5 duplicate costumes and versions of characters, especially Naruto and Sasuke and some characters are only available as supports and aren't selectable as mains. All this in mind, and the final figure is around 80 UNIQUE characters. Controls - Depends To really enjoy this game, you REALLY need a controller or be a ninja yourself with the keyboard and mouse. I personally have an Xbox One controller and really liked using it with this game (they work perfectly together). Gameplay - 4/5 In the Ninja World Tournament Mode, which you will find yourself spending most of your time in (as it has most of the content in the game) has very different mechanics as opposed to the rest of the series. Gone are the days when all you had to do to advance in the story was beat the pulp out of your singular enemy. Instead, you will find yourself faced with three foes, each with the singular intent of collecting as many ""Battle Orbs"" as possible. This is done by beating up your enemies and picking up the glowing orbs that are dislodged. The Battle Orbs also function as your health. When you lose all of them, you become stunned and vulnerable, in this state all it takes is one hit to take you out of the round.In Free Battle Mode the normal Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm series combat makes a return, with one major change. You can no longer use both your Awakening and Ultimate Jutsu in a battle at once. Instead, you must choose between them and another option called ""Drive"" mode, (which gives your two support characters additional functionality) at the beginning of the match. The 3D arena combat is quit simple so don't expect much of the complexity offered by Bandai Namco's other 3D fighter, Tekken.The Free roam elements have been pretty much taken out. I personally don't mind too much as the main draw to me was never the free roam and it was always quite mediocre. Instead, you are allowed to explore the setting of the Ninja World Tournament, Festival Island. The island is quite small, boring and sparse, except for the characters littered about, whom you must talk to be offered sidequests to be able to use them in the Tournament. Value - 4.5/5 To do ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING in the game, it will take you about 17-18 hrs. I did all that, plus a little online play for a couple of hours giving me a total of about 20 hrs as you can see above.The game is fairly cheap on steam compared to most other significant titles. I, myself picked it up when it was on sale during the Bandai Namco Developer Weekend at $2.5, so I got excellent value at 8 hrs/$.The DLCs are terribly overpriced(cost more than the game itself altogether) and add nothing but costumes, so DO NOT buy those unless you are either a psycho, a collector or a HUUUGE weeaboo. Fans Perspective - 4/5 The various sidequests required to unlock characters to use in the main Ninja World Tournament Mode render decent fan service, and the game renditions of iconic characters from the Narutoverse are quite accurate personality wise and it shows in their dialogue. The Mecha-Naruto side story offered some NaruHina moments and some decent voice acting (I mean in Japanese, the Engish voice acting was somewhat cringy as ever). Bottom line - Decide for yourself what this game is worth to you and how much you want to spend on it. The game itself was never meant to be a contender for Game Of The Year or wow anyone with its graphics, just to keep fans satisfied till Storm 4 arrived. My suggestion is that if like me, you are a moderate fan of the series, the game is worth the money on sale.";29 April, 2018;

NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution;mindDRIFTER;NOT INFORMED;89 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 47.4 hrs on record;"Revolution is a game made for entertaining, not impressing. It is a fanservice, a way to spend time in an enjoyable way, not something that will cause catharsis. Is it good? Depends on how you look at it. As a fighting game, it's superior in every way for their predecessors. Still, there had to be a downside when compared to the old games: it has no storyline. Thing is, the game doesn't need one. I played it 100% to be sure of that. It has a lot of characters and even more sidequests. There's a whole island to free roam, new areas get accesible as you progress in the tournaments, areas where you can find characters, do what they request to unlock them. On the island you can also exchange medals to get accesories and you can try your luck at the lottery. The tournament mode is a lot of fun, it's well designed and the challange clearly goes higher as you go near the end of the path, the spot where your chosen ninja is acclaimed as being the greatest of them all. Best part is, it doesn't get repetitive. There are obstacles, enemy power ups, all kinds of things to keep you pumped.There's also a short story involving an abandoned concept, the mecha-naruto, a story which has some humour, some moral talking(you have to look deep) and an emotional end. It can also be considered as a NaruHina fanservice. One feature that should be noted is the Team Ultimate Jutsu, which actually makes the ""who's on your team) matter, as the strong combo involves the compatible characters do awesome stuff together.30 FPS lock kills the mood for the regular PCGamer, but you won't notice it, as it keeps steady and the actions are fast, flashy and quite spectacular. You can enjoy the combat by choosing what type of extra power your chosen characters will have, the league mode, another tournament mode and the survival mode, where some great challanges awaits.For the online part I'll say: same old, same old. I have to keep my finger crossed to get a lag free match. Good thing is, achievment hunters don't need to bother with it.As for the DLC, all are skin packs, the story is safe and tucked away for the next game.This is the first game I pre-ordered and I don't have any reason to regret it. The predecessor had a moving story. This one got everything else better, that's why I enjoyed it a lot more. It has a lot of content and most of it is great, this game delivered on it's promises. While many say it could be better in some aspects, as someone who played all the game has to offer, I don't give a f**k. A storyline would have made it shine brighter than Naruto in Beast Mode, but I guess they're keeping the best for last(next game just has to be that awesome)This game is a 9.4.";5 October, 2014;

Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number;slower,;NOT INFORMED;364 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 246.4 hrs on record;I feel the need to make an actual review for this game, because too many positive reviews for it are just memes and can be overshadowed by the more comprehensive negative reviews.Hotline Miami can be tough to talk about, because Hotline Miami 1 was such a hit that this game will always be compared to it based on HM1's merits alone. The original game was about a masked serial killer who got mysterious phone calls threatening him into carrying out hits on mob locations. The whole story was pretty strange and trippy, with very little being what it seems. The gameplay was super fast and hectic as you ran around scavenging whatever you could find to beat the brains out of the army of mafia waiting in the buildings. The combat was close quarters-oriented with some enemies with guns, but mostly melee focused. Each mask had different abilities that affected your starting weapon, or gave you abilities like killing punches or spawning more guns as random pickups. All in all, it was a fairly good game with all of this. The reason why I didn't really like Hotline Miami 1 was because the AI was actually fairly buggy and reacted either very sluggishly or hyper-quickly, without reason. The level design was very tight, and due to the ridiculous speed of everything, it felt too hard to control. I would finish a level and feel like I'd gotten lucky.Hotline Miami 2 managed to fix a fair amount of the problems with the first. The combat is slowed down somewhat. Guns;19 April, 2016;

Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number;miguel;522 products in account;278 people found this review helpful17 people found this review funny; Recommended 44.2 hrs on record;"Having played 28 hours of this game, I've decided to tell you why I think that this game is worth every cent.Obviously, It is absolutely imperative that you play the original game BEFORE playing this one.Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a game developed by Dennaton Games and published by Devolver Digital and serves as the sequel for Hotline Miami, a ""A hyper-violent top-down shooter/brawler"" and one of the most critically aclaimed indie games of all time.The game takes place after, during, and before the events of its predecessor and manages to maintain some of the frantic action that popularized the first game, HOWEVER, Wrong Number is much more story focused than the the original and serves as the developers way to tie up loose ends.The gameplay retains certain aspects of from Hotline Miami but the levels are designed in such a way that you have to cower in fear behind each door and wait for the perfect moment so as to not get either snipped by a shotgun from across the map or spotted through a window.I, like most people, didnt enjoy this kind of level design, because there are enemies outside your camera's range who can react faster than you and end what seemed like a perfect run.One of the aspects the latter didnt retain from the former was the melee combat. In this game, melee combat was somewhat nerfed, making the melee swing slower and the and the range smaller.One of the most controversial characteristics of Hotline Miami 2 is its relatively large cast of playble characters. But Haplop, how could more characters equal less fun.Well for starters you have more characters but less unique playstyles. There are 27 masks each with their unique gimmicks and playstyles opposed to the 14 characters of Hotline Miami 2. Whats more is that there most characters dont add anything new, here's whats new.Fists of Fury,(used by 2 different characters), lethal punches, cant pick up any weapons, wich renders it sorta useless since the levels are so big.Dodge Roll,(used by 2 different characters) you press space to dodge in the direction you are pointing and become invincible in the mean time, can sometime cause you to miss floor executions.Chainsaw and Guns,(unique) you control one of 2 sibllings wich (the one rocking the chainsaw), with your right mouse button you force the second sibling to shoot. The AI on the second sibling can be kinda buggy, and will sometimes become stuck behind walls while you charge inside a room full of mobsters armed to the teeth with nothing but a chainsaw.Two machine guns, (used by 2 different characters) you start with 2 smgs, you can have 64 bullets and can only reload once, after that, there is nothing special to it.Start with a nailgun,(unique)- 24 nails, silent killer, nothing out of the ordinary.Inner warrior,(unique) Fists of Fury with nunchucks.Remember the Richter and Aubrey mask from the previous game? They now grant no special abilities.There is also a character wich instead of killing can incapacitate and disarm foes for bonus points.You also get to play as a soldier wich can switch between a knife and one of for weapons ( a rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle and a flamethrower) but cant pickup any other weapons.The soundtrack is just downright beautiful featuring the works of El Huervo, M|O|O|N, Perturbator and many other independent artists, it can go from slow and melancholic to full on assault in seconds and it really does not only live up to the standards set by the previous game but somehow also manages to surpass them by a pretty big stretch.Not only that but the audio in general is really descriptive and the mushy sound of grey matter splattering all over the room does add to the gory factor of the game, wich by the way, makes great use of the Hitchcock effect (google it)The sprites may seem a bit, how should I put it, wonky (?) at first but after playing through it you realize that it is one of the best way to convey to the player the setting of Miami's 1980's. Overall the game in itself is great, the gameplay isnt as satisfying as that of the 1st game but the story is beautifully written. Its a much more down-to-earth game and the story always has you feeling sorrowful and melancholic while still keeping you interested and engaged as you watch this immensely dense plot unravel before your eyes while you cant really do anything about it.I guess that that is what really gives you a sense of accomplishment, once you manage to get the bigger picture that is.So...Do you still like hurting other people?Let me know if you agree with this review or not.";14 September, 2015;
Motorsport Manager - Endurance Series;ThinkOn;NOT INFORMED;No one has rated this review as helpful yet; Not Recommended 1.7 hrs on record;Motorsport Manager is a game that promises a lot for fans of racing simulations, and in many ways, it delivers a detailed and authentic managerial experience. However, despite its many strengths, it falls short in one crucial area: it just isn't that fun.On the positive side, Motorsport Manager excels in its depth and attention to detail. The game offers a comprehensive and realistic simulation of managing a racing team. From designing cars and hiring drivers to strategizing for races and managing finances, every aspect of running a motorsport team is covered. The level of detail is impressive and will appeal to those who love diving deep into the intricacies of management.The game also does a great job in terms of presentation. The graphics are clean and polished, and the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. The in-race graphics, while not groundbreaking, are serviceable and give a good sense of the action on the track. The sound design, including the roar of engines and the chatter of team radios, adds to the immersive experience.However, despite these positive aspects, Motorsport Manager struggles to keep the player engaged over the long term. The gameplay, while detailed, can become repetitive and tedious. The races themselves, which should be the highlight of the game, often feel more like a chore than an exciting event. The lack of dynamic and unpredictable elements during races means that they can quickly become monotonous, with the same strategies and outcomes playing out over and over again.Additionally, the game's pacing can be a problem. Progressing through the seasons and building a competitive team takes a significant amount of time and effort, which can feel unrewarding when the moment-to-moment gameplay doesn't provide enough excitement or variety. The grind of managing all the details without enough payoff in terms of thrilling race action can wear down even the most dedicated players.In conclusion, Motorsport Manager is a game that offers a deep and realistic simulation of racing team management, but it ultimately fails to deliver a consistently fun and engaging experience. For those who love detailed management sims and have the patience for a slow burn, it might still be worth a try. However, for players looking for a more dynamic and exciting racing game, Motorsport Manager may not hit the mark.; 12 June;

Arma 3 Apex;V1P3RF1GHT3R;NOT INFORMED;1 person found this review helpful; Recommended 32.9 hrs on record;"Arma 3, developed by Bohemia Interactive, stands as a pinnacle in the military simulation genre, offering an expansive, immersive, and highly realistic battlefield experience. Since its release in 2013, Arma 3 has continued to evolve, incorporating updates and expansions that enrich its already vast world. Here’s a deep dive into what makes Arma 3 a standout title.Graphics and EnvironmentOne of Arma 3’s most notable features is its stunning graphics. The game is set on two main islands, Altis and Stratis, which are inspired by real-world Mediterranean landscapes. The level of detail in the environment is extraordinary, from the dense forests and arid plains to the urban settings. The lighting effects, weather systems, and day-night cycles contribute to an immersive atmosphere, enhancing the realism of the simulation.Gameplay and MechanicsArma 3 is not for the faint-hearted or those looking for a casual shooter experience. It’s a hardcore military simulator that requires patience, strategy, and teamwork. The game offers various modes, including single-player campaigns, multiplayer battles, and a comprehensive editor mode. The mechanics are intricate, with a focus on realistic ballistics, injury simulation, and vehicle handling. Players must consider factors like stamina, inventory management, and tactical positioning to succeed.The single-player campaign, ""The East Wind,"" offers a gripping narrative with multiple branching paths, ensuring replayability. However, the game truly shines in its multiplayer mode, where large-scale battles with complex objectives unfold, requiring coordinated efforts and tactical prowess.Community and ModsArma 3’s longevity and continued relevance can be attributed significantly to its modding community. Bohemia Interactive has embraced modding, providing robust tools and support for user-generated content. This has led to an abundance of mods, ranging from simple quality-of-life improvements to total conversion mods that introduce entirely new scenarios and mechanics. Popular mods like ACE3 (Advanced Combat Environment) and ALiVE (Advanced Light Infantry Virtual Environment) add layers of depth and realism, making the game even more challenging and engaging.Learning Curve and AccessibilityOne of the criticisms often leveled at Arma 3 is its steep learning curve. The game does not hold the player’s hand, and newcomers might find the initial experience overwhelming. The complex controls, realistic mechanics, and the necessity for strategic thinking can be daunting. However, for those willing to invest the time to learn, the game offers a deeply rewarding experience. The community is generally helpful, with numerous tutorials, guides, and forums available to assist new players.Performance and Technical AspectsPerformance-wise, Arma 3 can be demanding. It requires a powerful system to run smoothly, especially in large-scale multiplayer battles or when utilizing high-definition mods. Optimization has improved over the years, but occasional bugs and glitches can still occur. Despite these issues, the game’s depth and complexity often make up for its technical shortcomings.ConclusionArma 3 is a game that excels in delivering a realistic military simulation experience. Its vast, detailed environments, complex mechanics, and active modding community create a game that is both challenging and immensely satisfying. While it may not be accessible to everyone due to its steep learning curve and technical demands, those who delve into its depths will find a rich and rewarding experience. Whether you are a fan of military strategy, tactical gameplay, or immersive simulations, Arma 3 is a title that deserves a place in your gaming library."; 10 June;

Remnant: From the Ashes;Coronaus;194 products in account;402 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 46.6 hrs on record;I see some complaints about the enemy leveling in the game so I'd like to take a chance to at least let players know what they are getting into specifically before had and how it works with a quick rundown of how it works. When you first enter an area in remnant, the average level of your gear (known as gear score) is taken and that is essentially the level of the enemies that will spawn in that area until you regenerate that area by restarting the campaign. So, i enter a floor of a dungeon at level 4, i clear it and enter the boss room at 4 as well. If I'm unprepared for that boss and getting absolutely shafted, its an option to backtrack to the previous area, which remains level 4, raise my gear level to 5, and then go beat the boss, which would still be at level 4. Going to the area after the boss would have it set to 5 in this scenario. It allows you the chance to go against bosses at a similar strength level to what the devs intended originally without allowing for vast levels of variation. If you prefer the challenge, you can go at the boss all you want and work on beating it at the intended level. On my first playthrough, i only had to go back and farm a level for around 2 of the bosses. Hope someone will take a second to read this and at least have an idea of how it works. People just assume its autoscaling in every area without the full clearing of the campaign but that is not the case.;20 August, 2021;

Remnant: From the Ashes;+;NOT INFORMED;421 people found this review helpful11 people found this review funny; Recommended 54.2 hrs on record;"Overview Remnant: From The Ashes (RFTA) is a hybrid between a traditional 3rd person Shooter RPG, such as The Division, and the Souls-like genre. Set in a time when an inter-dimensional plague known as the Root devastated Earth and other worlds, players will be tasked in finding a way to stop it, and in doing so traverse many strange, dangerous dimensions and planets, looking for the truth about not only the Root, but also their hidden destiny.This mixture of genres plays out surprisingly well, taking many elements characteristic of Souls games: rolls with i-frames, replenish-able healing items, map shortcuts, bonfires, material-based gear upgrading system, special boss items, and plenty of secret areas where to find unique loot or puzzles. The Souls-like part is not predominant though, as many elements from traditional RPG-FPS also are significant in the gameplay, such as upgrading Traits (passives) to build a specialized character, enemy scaling based on gear level, or equipping the right sets, weapons, and mods, which grant active skills charged by dealing damage, that best suit your class' purpose.Solo or in co-op, players will have to traverse various areas filled with enemies and loot, first on Earth and then in other alien worlds. Each zone has a ""main path"" to follow, and several secondary dungeons. Because of random generation, bosses, area types, and secondary dungeons as well are different every play-through. As a consequence, each player can end up with different boss weapons, items, and gear pieces compared to others, because their worlds are different. Of course playing together in the same world means getting the same gear. This mechanic boosts replay-ability by a lot, with the chance of finding what was missed in the previous run, and since there are three difficulties to clear, that is good.On the bad side, it has to be said that boss fights, in general, are rather underwhelming as they rely more upon spamming tons of trash mobs to create difficulty, rather than having better boss design themselves. Other than this, optimization is not very good, with slow-downs even on high-end builds in certain areas, nothing too serious. The fact some mods or weapons are much more powerful than others, and because of RNG they can be missed, unbalances the late-game phases a bit, especially against the final boss, where specific mods and weapons are fundamental. Level design is also not the best, with places looking all too similar to each other.I suggest this game to any Souls fans, and also to who enjoyed games such as The Division, meaning TPS-RPGs. Offering about 16-18 hours of content for one run, with three difficulties to clear, good replay-ability, i can suggest full price purchase to fans of either genre that also have a team to play with, while players just curious are better off waiting for at least a small sale.Rating:GoodLiked this review, and want to see more of the same quality?

I've played quite a few games that look good on paper but are just crap in execution, this game seems to be the exact opposite. Everything in this game seems so disjointed and nonsensical but for some reason it ends up a fairly fun to play.Short version:Gameplay is enjoyableBosses are funBuilds are varied enoughStory is complete nonsenseFacial animation is a horror showVoice acting is okayGame is goodThe game itself feels like a mix of several other games. It's a bit like warframe in that you get a primary weapon, secondary weapon and melee weapon. Instead of the skills warframes get you can slot a single mod per weapon. It has some of borderlands crazy weapons as well. Crossbows that shoot 5 bolts at a time, a pistol that shoots exploding orbs, or a the ricochet rifle that shoots energy disks that bounce everywhere. The game doesn't have many weapons though (about 15-20 of each type) but still has some strange options, that combined with armor that gives bonus stats and the rings and amulets that can give pretty powerful effects as well the game does have a decent build variety. The weapon mods can range from normal things like grenade launcher and flamethrower addons to full on magic spells. The gameplay also has a bit of dark souls like mechanics. There are large bosses that you need to learn the fight mechanics/attacks and apply dodging correctly to win. The atmosphere is fairly dark and dismal in a souls-ish fashion. Though it has rogue like elements too. The game only generates so many dungeons in your campaign, and it's not enough to have every boss. So the bosses you'll see in a play through are somewhat random. In addition to that, some bosses (and a few events) have multiple ways to win resulting in a different reward which can then be turned into a weapon/mod. This randomness is to encourage replay, which is a game design I usually find tedious and boring, again it somehow works here.;24 September, 2020;

To those who say it's too short: you've seen about half the game at most. There are 40 bosses in total, if you include the DLC. It's procedural so each play-through includes different map layouts, special events, locations, bosses and enemies. Higher difficulties reveal special enemies and events you don't get at easier settings. If you don't fancy replaying the whole game - adventure mode is for you, which allows you to run through on area, with associated bosses and dungeons, meaning you can see most of the game barring certain inter-map bosses/encounters. Very roguelike, plenty to do way beyond a single story playthrough. There's at least one boss which spawns only in adventure mode. Excellent, bold move in the dev's part. After that there's also Survival Mode, where you start with very few items and play until you die ...My main complaint: like many (RPG) games, it gets the difficulty curve wrong. It's at its hardest at the start, when you have no perks or special weapons and haven't quite worked out the skills. Dark Souls gets this right and the game remains a real challenge to the end. Remnant doesn't get super easy but it definitely gets easier. I started on ""Normal"" difficulty and it seemed like Normal difficulty would be enough... but by halfway through, with the weapons and mods I had, i realised it was getting too easy and had to restart - that being the only way to reset difficulty.Secondly: the level of each area is based on your weapon/armour levels when you enter the area, with a heavy bias towards your single highest level item, so levelling one or two items quickly really works against you as other bits of gear lag behind. Tip: level everything just one level at a time (to keep them all at the same level). In general, it's better not to level gear unless you absolutely have to and want a bonus against the current area/boss, but you'll pay for it in the next when difficulty ramps up, since fighting higher level enemies makes them slightly harder and once you get to level 20, that's it. No more out-levelling the game by upgrading equipment - though new traits/skills will continue to make the game easier. I finished the main game + DLC with gear at level 16 (Hard difficulty) where in my first playthroughs I'd levelled one weapon to 20 in just by half way through. Not that this made the game excessively hard, barring a couple of bosses, but it does make the game experience inconsistent. Boss weapons which require special resources to upgrade only level to 10 and count double for difficulty purposes. So a level 8 boss weapon counts as if it's level 16 when calculating dificulty.If you are playing in a party, playing coops, it uses the levels of the weapons carried by all players, so if someone has something super upgraded the others might find themselves having issues...even if that party member leaves, the area remains at the higher level once generated.Players need to have all this explained to them so they definitely get it and there's no way they can miss it. Over and over. e.g. have a popup appear when they level a weapon which changes their effective level saying ""Levelling this weapon to level 12 will increase your effective level from 11 to 12, which will increase the strength/difficulty of enemies in any new areas you enter, for your whole party. It will not affect enemies in locations you have already visited. Do you want to proceed?"". At the moment I think the only place you can see your weapon level is on the opening character selection screen. The game takes no account of player level, traits/skills gained etc when setting difficulty, which seems odd. Even if it's just +1 level per 50,75 or even 100 trait points, some account should be taken.Like Dark Souls, Remnant makes use of iframes - but never explicitly mentions or explains this and both games fall foul on this one. If you're new to the genre - iframes are grames of various animations during which a player usually will not take damage. Most obviously in rolls/dodges, so even if an enemy hits you and you're mid roll, you won't take damage. You're vulnerable at the start and finish of each roll, so it's not a get out of jail free card, and timing rolls is key, depending on the enemy attack, but it's an intended feature and not knowing about it is a hinderance. I don't know if Remnant does this but certainly in Dark Souls, the lighter your encumbrance, the further you roll and the less time you spend in the vulnerable 'getting up' and 'starting roll' animation phases ... but since Remnant does talk about armour encumbrance quite a bit, I assume that the heavier you armour the less effective your rolls, as a trade off...There are weapons of different types, e.g. radiation, bleed, freeze, but apparently different enemies don't have different resistances. So, once I got my super bleed crossbow and a ring which transferred bleed damage to healing for me, I mostly stuck with it. TBH the crossbow as OPAF long before that, but the fact that I could, for example, cause bleed damage on a black hole seemed nonsense. Apparently this was a conscious decision by the devs who wanted all builds to work on all enemies, which to me seems like a really bad decision. It trivialises weapon choice, levelling, depth and reduces the longevity of the game. I mean, i had to grind up a fast firing weapon for the Ixillis boss fight one fight, as I didn't have one, and that's not too different to grinding up a weapon with say poison damage because you know it's particularly effective against certain enemies i'm having issues with.Also: let me reset difficulty mid-way through a playthrough, instead of having to restart, so that all new areas generated are created with the new difficulty and I don't have to go back to the beginning. OK, so only credit me for having completed it at the lowest difficulty I set during any one playthrough but as long as you give me PLENTY of warning about this, that's fine. I am playing because I enjoy the gameplay. At most make me replay the area/zone I am in.Also: make difficulty selection more apparent at the start of the game. There's a reason most games have it separate from the character designer: it's out of place and isn't part of the character creation process. Players don't expect to see it there, they're likely to miss it.";17 October, 2020;

Epic Battle Fantasy 4;Gentleman;NOT INFORMED;603 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 88.0 hrs on record;This game is a must-buy for any RPG fan!While its style is distinctly western, in everything but art Epic Battle Fantasy is very much a JRPG. The combat is heavily based on elemental advantage/weaknesses – brute force is rarely an option in harder battles, instead the key to victory is using correct skills and gear.Speaking of gear, uniquely among RPGs, newer weapons and armor you acquire are not direct improvement of your old equipment. Instead, each weapon and armor has properties that make it good in some situations and mediocre to bad in others. The result is that no equipment becomes useless, and some of early gear may very much be an option for endgame battles.Instead of acquiring stronger gear, the game features upgrade system for your equipment, allowing you to improve your gear as you progress through the game (most later upgrades require items that are not available until later). And on final note about gear, each item your character wears, from weapons and armor to small badges visibly changes your appearance, which is really a nice touch!The story doesn’t even pretend to be serious, but it will accomplish what it sets out to: make you laugh from start to finish!Overall, Epic Battle Fantasy is all kinds of awesome. If you like turn-based RPGs, give it a try and it won’t disappoint!;27 February, 2014;

This game has a very cool track evolution feature coded into it that affects grip if cars leave/enter the track by scattering dirt onto the track, for example. It simulates weather very well, although the developers are working on improving it further.- The developers truly care about their product, and are constantly working to address known issues and improve the game drastically.; 14 June;

Sure, there are things I would have preferred to be more complex, spoilt by the combat systems of Dark souls and the Witcher, but what's so special about this game is the storytelling and the creative courage Ninja Theory bring. This isn't just a game. This is a sincere artwork, using game design, to tell the most compelling story about psychosis I've ever experienced. They did their homework, not just with the depiction of mental illness, but also on the wonderful Norse mythology, joyously wrestled from the bubblegum claws of Marvel studios and told with all its blood and guts and grim darkness. Senua is easily the most human heroine I've seen in any game ever, and while there have been more 'strong' female characters, there's no heroism like the heroism of the truly broken and crippled. She has to fight her demons, and it's all the more meaningful because unlike fem-Shepard who eats Reapers for breakfast, you can see in the gorgeously motion captured performance of Senua's face, that she is truly terrified as she fights. This game is short. This game probably has awful replay value. All the same, this game is a MUST play.;11 August, 2017;

This is the most linear game I have ever played which usually is something I extremely dislike, but weirdly enough I really enjoyed this game.In this game you can't jump, the only thing you can interact with is opening doors, climbing ladders, picking up a torch, listening to the stories from the rune stones. Literally can't do anything other than that. There are no items to collect, no nothing, just battles, jogging, and cut scenes. Everything I hate, all in one game. Yet I enjoyed this game.I think it's the whole, sad, creepy, eerie, and dark ambient atmosphere, the music together with the norse theme, and the beautiful graphics. What impressed me the most was the unique binaural audio, the highlight of the whole game experience. The game being based on psychosis, all those whispering sounds gave me chills so many times. It felt like the voices were right behind me, whispering right next to my ears, it's hard to explain but it felt so real. It was a little annoying at first, I was wondering when it would stop, but it grew on me after a while. I can't imagine what it would be like for people who live with psychosis everyday. The voices were making fun of Senua, but also helping her during fights, then criticizing and belittling her, but also cheering for her. It sure was a roller coaster of feelings. The illusions were so trippy, I had no idea what was going on but then I realized my eyes were being tricked. I liked the challenges, loved the fighting, even if I played on hard mode it was really easy to beat the game. I wish there could be more to the game, the lack of interaction other than walking made the game feel empty. I hope the sequel will be greater. I wish you could skip the cut scenes.

Following the story of Picts warrior maid Senua, you embark on a nightmarish and mind-twisting journey to Helheim, to save a beloved one’s soul. However, for Senua, many things aren’t what they’re supposed to be, for she’s suffering from severe psychosis. While you often can’t decide what’s real and what not, you must overcome many obstacles and enemies – the latter seemingly coming right out of Hel(l).No other game, up to this point, managed to devour me – getting me so immersed – like Hellblade did. This game just pulled me deeper than any other game has accomplished in recent years, and I, mentally, switched off everything else around me and Senua’s reality became mine. The sound design and visual presentation is outstanding.I was always a fan of non-linear storytelling and Hellblade totally nailed it. Its presentation is intriguing, captivating and keep you ever so interested in what happened (to Senua) and how everything will turn out.As for the gameplay I was kind of surprised of what they came up with: There's a level where there is nothing but darkness and you have to find your way out, without fighting, only using your senses, as Senua's reaching out with her hand to frisk her surroundings, or running from one light source to another to not getting devoured by darkness. In other parts, cynically spoken, you could call it 'walking simulator', but, as for myself, I was so immersed in the world that I didn't mind. It doesn’t deliver any boredom even when ‘nothing’ happens.There is one thing to explore off the main paths, however: Lore stones. These stones – telling you about Norse mythology in appearance of an old friend – are optional but critical in further expanding on the whole game’s story. At first one might not see the entangled meaning of Norse mythology and it seems rather random, just to give this game a Norse touch although you're not playing a viking heroine. Certainly, Vikings are involved in the story but that doesn’t necessarily explain why you keep hearing stories about the Northmen. But keep your wits about you and you’ll come to realize the importance of those stories.I also enjoyed the combat, although it lacks complexity and deep mechanics. So, what is to like about it? Its responsiveness and simplicity made it a blast to play. It is quick, brutal, intense and it just works without any clumsiness. In that regard it is sort of 'flawless', straight on point. Don't expect anything near like Dark Souls, though.Visual clues were used in a clever way and weren't spelled out boldly for you with exclamation marks, compass needles and the like. Even in one given situation where acting under pressure and time limit was required, I managed to find all the necessary clues at the first try without said compass needle or other HUD markers pointing out where to go – there are voices telling you to ""focus"" or to look in another direction. The lack of (almost) any meta information fits the theme of the game and it is an enjoyable change in a video game. That being said, there's no ""meta game"" telling you how to do things (apart from the game options menu). No HUD, no text boxes or pop ups. Everything you need to know to beat the game is offered by the environments and from 'within' the game.It absolutely has become one of my favorite games by now.";22 November, 2017;

I'm an older player (65) who enjoys video games. I am very impressed with the game overall though I do wish I didn't have the CTD's and other issues with the game. But the ability to do the kind of building along with the post war setting has been a lot of fun. Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try. I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things. I do use quite a few mods and I'm sure the contributes to the CTD's etc in the game. I thing Bethsadia has done a great job presenting this game. I played the original Fallout many years ago. Having learned how to make video's of the gameplay and posting on youtube (mostly for my grandson to see my settlements) has been a nice side benefit of playing fallout. I would recommend the game and using mods...just do all you can to ensure things are loaded correctly.;26 March, 2017;

I think this game should be reviewed by listing the good, the bad and the mixed things individually:The good:+ By far the most detailed, vivid and interesting game world so far. The Commonwealth has a wide variety of different areas to explore, from urban ruins and blasted forests to swamps and the horrifically irradiated Glowing Sea. The game world is also nicely seamless, so there aren't many loading screens outside of interiors and major settlements.+ The combat is so much better than in the last two games. For example, you can now throw grenades and mines without having to put down your current weapon, you can swing your gun to bash anyone that gets too close, and you're no longer forced to wait until the reload animation is finished before you can switch weapons or access your Pip-Boy. In general, the combat also feels much more fluent and intense.+ The new crafting and settlement systems are very extensive (if not very realistic). You can upgrade your weapons and armor as you meet the perk requirements, but you can also use the system to make some rather atypical ones - things like;10 October, 2018;

Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire;ScarletRaven;NOT INFORMED;117 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 79.7 hrs on record;The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:The Good:-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories-A lot of voice-acting-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes-You can retrain your characters-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it -Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from-Romance options-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)The Bad:-Loading screens are too long and too many-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.Advice:-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can-Always have a tank and healer in the party-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all-Enchant your items-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it outMy game experience:I played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.I had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.I really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.;24 April, 2021;

The game was there for me after I actually went Wael-level mad, while I struggled with clinging to some kind of normality. When I stabilised, but was completely alone in the world, the game was there, connecting me to my old self and making me feel less lonely. After I finally returned to some kind of normality, it reminded me of the crazy whirlwinds I had gone through and welcomed me back to life.

The Watcher, armed with a ship and in the company of a motley crew of characters, must fight, convince, or connive his way to reach Eothas. But as you, the player does so, getting caught into the web of politics, betrayals, and 'go to X and do Y' quests. The Deadfire Archipelago is filled with the unknown and yet unexplored lands. Four factions vie for control of the isles with each one having their own agendas and plans.Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is and has always been conceived as a modern take on the 2D text-based RPGs of the 1990s. It is played with a top-down view and static camera, partnered with long lines of texts that can either enrich your vocabulary or irreparably cross your eyes altogether.The game mainly uses the combat mechanics found in the first Pillars of Eternity. Each character has a recovery period which is determined by their previous action, their equipment, and their stats. Once the bar depletes the character can execute a move. You can also just leave things to the AI but this kind of approach isn’t recommended especially on higher levels of difficulty. Manually placing your units and giving them their commands during intense parts of combat is key in winning.One huge departure from the first game is the introduction of ships as home bases. Here, the player can manage party composition, resources, and character interaction. Wandering across the seas of Deadfire requires both manpower and resources.Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire may not be for everyone. First obvious reason would be its slow-burn pacing. With its world, taking everything into account and absorbing it takes time.Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is a beautiful and thoroughly enjoyable RPG, one which I'd happily recommend. If you loved the first Pillars of Eternity, you’ll definitely love this one.THE GOOD- Fantastic writing- Beautiful isometric world- Balanced real-time combat- Fascinating depth and detail to the world- Well-constructed side contentTHE BAD- A bit slow at points- Ship-to-ship combat is a letdown9/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECEIf you like this review, then please consider giving it a thumbs up.

As it happens, I never played the first POE but I have enjoyed this so much. This is right up there with the best in it's genre, like DOS/DOS2. I came straight from Divinity Original Sin 2 to this. As a result, I thought I would prefer the newly released turn based mode, but it felt far too slow for me. Before going any farther, I immediately created a new game in the original RTWP mode, and haven't looked back.I have sunk soooo many more hours than I would've thought possible into this game, 300+, and that's just a single playthrough. There are tons of other companions I didn't touch, DLCs I haven't gotten to yet, and I haven't quite finished the main story either. There is a huge amount of replayability here. With the amount of content, hours played, and enjoyment I got from this game, I feel like this should've cost me several hundred dollars.If you like these types of games, you will really enjoy POE2, and it is absolutely worth full price.;9 June, 2020;

Please reread that... MOSTLY. The gunplay is the same. Every single year, we buy this ???? up. The COD community has to do better. I have no idea how you have a community that ??????? the most about this, yet doesn't do anything.; 12 June;

Karting Superstars;Nagster;168 products in account;53 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 1.2 hrs on record;I am disappointed for the price. Don't get me wrong, Karting Superstars is a fun game to jump into and do a quick race. But it feels like a DLC for Circuit Superstars. Yes, the camera angle is different, and the mechanics and physics have likely improved for this release, but still, for €15.74 (on sale at launch), it's not enough.What I am missing:- Splits: I want to know how far ahead the driver in front of me is, if I'm closing the gap or losing him.- Kart options: Yes, I know the store page says it wouldn't have this, but I feel like different CC levels or possibly a shifter cart would not have been a far reach.- Tracks: As listed, there are 6 with some variations giving us 16 total layouts. Circuit Superstars gives us 17 (I think) and that's not even counting layouts.- Pitstops: This used to be one of my favorite parts of Circuit Superstars. It added strategy, and even if you weren't the fastest of the group, some smart thinking or tire management could give you the win.The AI feels okay. they tend to ram a bit in the mid-field, but with 12 karts going into turn 1, I can't blame them. However, it does feel like the lead kart pulls away a lot due to not having to race others. This can make catching up rather challenging.To conclude, with more content, more polish (maps where tire barricades are floating off the ground), and more features, this game would be a recommended buy. But right now, it feels like an internal project from a hackathon that was a cool concept, got some time, and hit the Steam store.*Edit: I see that they have mentioned strategy mechanics and more tracks for down the line, however my review is based on what I got now for the money I spent today. I will keep an eye on this game and should it change update my review.**Just for reference, I did also put about 1.5h into the demo;13 September, 2023;

If you are a fan of improving your best lap times against your ghost and other people this game is excellent. The driving model is both solid and simple, but to execute a perfect lap is incredibly difficult. I have done the occasional race against AI and haven't bothered with online at all.

Sadly, the lack of people makes it feel like it's sunday afternoon everywhere every time of day. Euro Truck also doesn't have NPCs walking around but they can often be spotted at the companies you travel from and to. The only NPCs I found in Fernbus (other than the passengers you pick up) are waiting at a bus stop.** Traffic AI has its moments, but can also be quite dumb at times. The traffic in ETS2 is more polished but I feel the traffic in Fernbus is more dynamic and unpredictable. Just keep your eyes peeled and don't trust anyone to give way or react to you the same way they do in ETS2. They WILL ram into you if you try to merge on the highway if you cut it close.In summary the game is far from perfect, but the trips I've made so far were mostly enjoyable and relaxing. Be warned that you need a beefy graphics card to get the most out of the game, because it runs rather poorly. Hopefully future optimizations will follow and improve on this further.I've yet to try the paid dlc maps, but they look interesting and if ETS2's dlcs are any indication then these dlc maps should be a step up in quality from base game.TL:DR. pretty graphics, doesn't run great, meh traffic AI, relaxing to drive, worth a try if you liked ETS2/ATSEDIT: I forgot I have the Netherlands DLC, but I haven't checked it out enough to form an opinion in it. It's also rather small compared to the rest of Germany .);9 March, 2021;

Fernbus Simulator;Dr.;NOT INFORMED;44 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 9.3 hrs on record;I've thought of buying this game for quite a while and initially I chose not to, because of all the reviews. I bought it because it didn't seem so bad in one of the YouTuber's videos (although it is really odd that his ads are everywhere in the game - I don't think I've ever seen something like that before and it kind of makes you think. Go figure.).But now to pros and cons:PROS1. This game has quite some potential - the engine provides quite some room for expansion, and the topic is pretty interesting.2. The coaches are pretty nicely made.3. I had no trouble setting up the controls.4. Rain looks really great. 5. The check-in system is really fun. 6. FPS is stable on max settings, at least for me - no problems here with i7 Intel Processor and GTX 960M.CONS1. It feels like Early Access all the time. 2. There are A LOT OF bugs - from grass on the streets, rain falling through briges, passengers thinking that you're off road when you're not etc. etc.3. AI Cars are AWFUL, and I really mean awful - they can even stop in the middle of a highway, causing accidents - with you or another AI car hitting them, they can't figure how to get out of a traffic jam and whenever something unexpected happens, they can't cope with it at all. It really breaks the game for me - I want to feel like a good driver and I constantly have to break the rules and do something really dangerous to avoid accident or simply to move forward.4. GPS that doesn't help you at all frequently - it is supposed to show you which lane to choose but it displays all of them, so that you have to rapidly change the lane on the highway, even 2 or 3 at once, causing a very dangerous situation.5. Passengers disappearing when boarding the bus, only to reappear inside - it breaks the immersion a lot. 6. Sometimes I can't check the passengers in and have to restart the route. 7. Passenger models aren't that great - still way better than OMSI 2, but not great. 8. Fog in the rear mirrors - I constantly have this fog in the rear mirrors, which makes it impossible to see fast moving cars when changing lanes. 9. Many graphic glitches - LoD problems and problems with displays inside the car - unless you zoom at least once, the temperature and speed displays are glitched. Also, at times, road signs are blurry.10. AI cars constantly disappear or suddenly appear in front of you, many times causing accidents.My verdict - while it is not that bad, it feels beta right now. I cannot recommend this game in its present state, although I do hope that they will fix it in the future. It certainly has potential, but I don't like it when paying customers are doing what beta-testers should be doing.;9 September, 2016;

911 Operator;with;NOT INFORMED;789 people found this review helpful73 people found this review funny; Recommended 4.5 hrs on record;"As a 911 operator, I got a couple chuckles out of this game, but there are a few nitpicky things I'm not wild about either. This review is to address those issues. Overall, I like the game and recommend it for the money. It's fun and I'll keep playing it despite doing this for a living.***THIS REVIEW HAS MILD SPOILERS AND IS MEANT FOR FELLOW DISPATCHERS OR ANYONE WHO THINKS THIS IS AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF WHAT DISPATCH IS LIKE***1. Other Operators back me up here, but in my city if you request the police, you get the police. Even if the crime happened an hour ago, a week ago, whatever. You ask for them, they come. They might not be happy about it, but they come. This game penalizes you for sending officers on frivolous calls. Believe me, I'd like nothing better than to ticket people who waste 911's time, but that just isn't how it works in most major dispatch centers.2. OBS callers. Where all my crazy people at?! Also my 911 hangups? Butt Dials from disconnected government cell phones (Thanks Obama!). Babies playing with phones. This stuff takes up at least half my night.I liked that one of the first domestic calls in the game was a pizza call, that was a nice touch, but it's not terribly common. Dealing with barely cooperative cell phone companies to try and ping suicidal or injured people's location (looking at you T-Mobile)? All the ??????? time.3. I am not the Chief. I don't decide what specialized equipment (or in reality training, equipment is pretty standardized) each unit has. I can see what attributes each unit has, and dispatch them accordingly, but telling an officer he can't have his gun because he has a dog and body armor already? Not my job. I make due with what I'm given. There should be a mode where you don't get to decide anything, unit are manned based on the estimated budget of a city.4. I am not the County Executive. I don't hire police, EMS or Firefighters. I don't pay their salary (you know, directly) and I don't give half a damn about the financial side of it. Above my pay grade. Long as my check keeps coming, I'm good.5. Where's my ??????, outdated software?! My LEO servers with lag like a mofo. My Quad or (what's the word for 5? Cinc?) 5 screen setup, three keyboards, 3 computer mice and a footpedal? I multitask like you wouldn't believe if you've never done it. I'd love it if this interface was adequate to dispatching units. I'd suggest switching over tomorrow. I'd throw a party when our CAD was uninstalled. On that same topic, where my every state has different ways of entering wanted subjects at? Pain in the ass running out of state plates.6. Chatty Point to Point and units. Gotta love it when the adjacent agency keys up on the radio and tells you all about their stolen vehicle that's nowhere near you, has an impossible plate # and was stolen 4 hours ago. Or when your officers play musical chairs with the calls you assigned them because they're out of their assigned beat (to be fair, sometimes that's your fault for sending them there). Or EMS guy who thinks he's Shakespeare on the EMS radios? These things all tie up dispatching units until the air is clear to do so.7. The Fatigue. Play this game for 12 hours straight with no breaks unless someone relieves you to pee. Also, either quickly swallow your snack or spit it out when someone calls 911 or you have to dispatch a unit.8. Uncooperative callers. I've only played to Albequerque so far (Loved the Breaking Bad call), so maybe I haven't seen it yet. Sometimes, people are playing games with you. They don't actually want help, they want someone to leave and are using 911 as a threat and as such they won't tell you the address they're at. Sometimes that doesn't end well for them as the other party will take the phone away before I can get a rebid on the ANI/ALI screen.9. The Typing. Address, call comments, callback numbers. That stuff doesn't just appear by magic or mouse click. I type it all in and time is a factor. Should be a mode for that. Added to that, sometimes you don't understand people the first time they give you an address. You have to ask again. And again. Until they take the marbles out of their mouth and answer you.10. Officer callouts. Sometimes you have no idea there's been a crime, you're in an office. One of your cars keys up and says ""6 Lincoln 81, Traffic!"" You say ""6 Lincoln 81?"" They say ""traffic at the intersection of xxxx ave and yyyy street with a gold cutlass, plate for issue David Union Mary Boston Charles Adam Robert."" Means that unit is busy now writing a ticket. Can't send them anywhere.11. Duplicate calls. We live in an age of cell phones. In this game, if there's an accident the driver or a passerby calls you and tells you about it. In reality, the driver, the other driver, all 4 passengers of both vehicles, every passerby (that's good, if you see an accident call us about it!) the driver's kid sister she was texting with and her boyfriend in another state calls about it. You have to handle those calls professionaly but quickly to free up your phone lines for other emergencies.";25 February, 2017;

You can make Fire Rescue teams.5) Fast pacedCons:1) Calls tend to repeat. With the same people calling in about the same things.2) Zoning issues. Shop lifters in residential zones, or house fires in business districts. (don't take a map of a town you know to seriously)3) Clicking between units sometimes gets lost, and you send the unit that you just sent to something else to a new spot even after you clicked a new unit.4) Never know what are in the Updates.

Let me explain before you sick the Pickle Gang on me. I already thought going in I might not like this one because of the drastic departure from the first, but I wanted to give it a chance. First five minutes of battle and I knew I was screwed lol. I *loved* the first. It was fast enough to keep my interest but slow enough for my old arse to keep up.Overall, I loved the slow pace of the first while having a so-so level of difficulty. But I am horrible at bullet-hell games, and I really don't enjoy them. But this dev team is doing something different with an IP that they're clearly passionate about. That, and the character and writing of Turnip Boy, deserves a thumbs up.If you enjoyed the first and want more of what the train at the end of that game gave you, this is it. If you want more slower paced, Zelda-esque exploration, maybe cheer them on from afar this time. Maybe they'll do another adventure one for us old timers down the line.Great artwork, music, and concept. Just not for my tired hands and slow reflexes.; 18 January;

DiRT Rally 2.0;Scrodum;NOT INFORMED;189 people found this review helpful; Recommended 122.7 hrs on record;"tl.dr - Get the Game of the Year Edition when it's on sale.There’s a lot this game does right and there’s a few things it does wrong but the issue is these few things are either major or ""in the player's face"", so to speak.For the purposes of those reading, I'm reviewing GotY DIRT Rally 2.0 which comes with the various season DLCs and the ""FLAT OUT"" DLC. Game ModesThere are two primary modes that come with the game: Rally and Rallycross which both have a single player and multiplayer feature. Rally is your run of the mill point to point time attack style of racing where you run through various locations and see if you're faster than your competition.Every two stages you can enter a service area and get setup changes and car repairs. Repairs are offered as either a standard repair (fully fix the part), quick fix (cheap and fast repair, but leads to the part being un-repairable and diminishes quicker) or a full on replacement of the part. Repairs are also influenced by your expandable and upgradable team mechanics.In addition to costing you time, with a limit of 30 minutes to complete your repairs, they also cost money. Yes, it’s frustrating you run out of money and the game forces choice upon the player, but that’s what makes the game fun and interesting – rally is a very harsh motorsport after all and your driving style needs to weigh speed and risk of damage. Even if you run out of money, you can just do a quick rallycross event or online event and get some quick cash, complete those repairs and continue your rally as if your brief financial worries didn't exist in the first place. Good addition.Rallycross mode hasn’t changed much since the original game. You and 4-6 other drivers compete on a circuit in a traditional race with each driver having to take one “joker” lap, that is use a section of the course which is a bit longer than the normal course or face a hefty penalty. Events are divided into heats deciding drivers qualifying for a semi-final and then a final. Readers who have played the first game will notice that I didn’t mention hillclimb. Well, we have Polyphony to thank for that. Less said about exclusivity deals especially in this day and age the better. But let's now talk about what is in the game:LocationsThe game has 7 new rallies to try with the original 6 available via DLC. These new rallies are:Argentina – Gravel, narrow for the most part and very technical. But this is such a boring rally. The stages don’t really give the driver a chance to create a flow through the corners. The roads are so narrow you can’t pendulum turn and are forced to spam your handbrake just to get rotation at such low speeds. Either get rid of this or make it more open with sections that stretch the cars legs, so to speak, more prominent. Australia – Very much in the mould of previous Australian rallies shipped with the game. Thick gravel with a mix of high speed and technical bits. Always been a solid addition to the game since the 1990s.New Zealand – As above. Perhaps more technical. But perhaps the gravel is less abrasive? There isn’t much to say about it apart from what’s mentioned for Australia. There’s only so much you can do with gravel roads, I guess.Poland – Poland is a bit like Germany but the “openness” of sorts that you get there is replaced with crests in awkward places and sections of road seeing you go at the car’s limit whilst flanked by trees. And I love it. Good stuff, Codies – a fun addition to the DR roster.Spain – This is basically Monaco but without the ice and less hairpins. Decent addition.USA – A slow grower on me. Based in New England in the autumn, this is probably similar to Poland but with less tarmac and the straight sections are much less intimidating. Still a fun rally.Perth and Kinross [DLC] – I find this to be a narrower version of Finland. The straight sections with both trees and tree stumps uncomfortably close to the road and the technical bits test the driver. In my top 3 rallies in the game.The base game comes with eight licensed World Rallycross Tracks with Holjes, and Hell making it from DR to DR2 base game. Silverstone, Mettet, Barcelona, Trois-Rivieres, Loheac Bretagne and Montalgre completing the list. Further DLC introduces Bikernieki, Estering, Yas Snorina, Lydden Hill (DR1 clone) and Killarney.I’ll say I haven’t played enough of the rallycross to give you a fair assessment.CarsCars are pretty much as per the original with the 2010s class gone and replaced by the R5 category which shares some manufacturer presence with the original game. Added as well is the Kartcross Rallycross cars and Rally GT class which has Grand Tourers like the V8 Vantage and Porsche 911 if the 80s RWD cars didn’t have enough on power oversteer for you. But all your other favourites from Subaru, Mitsubishi, Ford, Lancia, VW, Audi and Peugeot (to name a few) are all featured.Notably Toyota are still excluded from the game but with that the car roster is actually pretty good with at least one car in the full roster appealing to everyone. Conclusion, gripes/ideasAgain, this is a solid title all in all and would recommend to people into racing games but maybe are getting tired of the whole driving ‘round in circles shtick so this game maybe of interest to you!I felt the major problem with the original was a lack of content and if you include for all the DLC there’s over twice the rallies which is a nice and certainly takes a lot longer for the player to learn the stages so massive kudos to Codemasters on that one. I must say, I’ve been more critical of this game purely because the original set a high bar for me and what to expect from a sequel and just want this series to do well. Anyway, with all that said time to get into my gripes:Still putting a massive red cross against charging players for DLC of existing stages with minimal effort going into them. I mean, if you want people to be happy to fork out for the DLC of DR1 content that maybe add an extra route so there’s new stuff to explore. People don’t like being charged for stuff they’ve already played – this isn’t your yearly Formula 1 release.Pace notes – Add a tool where players can edit pace notes for stages! I shouldn’t have to play a memory game on every stage because the co-driver has forgotten to mention that big tree on the exit that can cause terminal damage or that “5 right” which is actually a 3 right. Pace notes are just as important as car setups. Doesn’t even have to be complicated, just a simple 2D map of the stage showing where the call from the co-driver is triggered and what exactly he says. When you’re done click “test stage” and drive the stage. Having a simple slider for earlier or later co-driver calls isn’t good enough as you expand the amount of track players have to remember.Setups – I really miss the sliders in the original game. Bring them back as I’m a setup pleb that doesn’t speak in exact terms as to how I want stuff done. Being able to go “ah yeah, a tick softer should be better” was a good introduction to players who find the setup menu intimidating and confusing.Restarts – Originally, you had a credit reward if you used 5 or less restarts over the rally. Now you get 5 restarts and that’s it? Well, it would be but you can circumvent this by just quitting to the main menu and loading back in: rendering the restart limit pointless and creating needless tedium. Just bring back the credit bonus system and let the player decide if they want to limit restarts like in Dirt Rally.The Game Size – 107GB for everything which is nuts. I appreciate more content means more space, but this is the kind of size which would make Flight Sims blush. As the game expands and gets more complex, Codemasters should look into how they can optimise their file sizes for future releases.Thanks for reading my TED talk";18 July, 2020;

Everything is so washed-up and unappealing. Even audio mix is less punchier thanks to lousy UE3 audio integration. Half of animations are fixed to sub-30 fps while in TLC they perfectly work with 100hz... And so on.I don't dig the new UI either. It's too huge, busy and convoluted af. Inventory management is a disaster by itself.Honestly, it's a mess and an absolutley pointless refresh for PC players. Original is usually dirt-cheap, has a robust mod support and just miles better in overall presentation and UI, so don't even bother with Anniversary.Base game itself is still fantastic though, Ave be praised.; 13 June;

As far as suggestions to fix these issues instead of just complaining would be to add a way to assemble a rack before purchase as part of the buying process, place all 4 PCs or whatever inside of a rack.Add a way to mass ""start up"" every PC in a room. Add a way to mass set what your mining to. I get you can do this for every thing in a rack, but when you have 40+ racks in a room it's preposterously tedious. OR add a way to shift+click and select multiple racks to change settings instead of just a singular rack.The game is NOT bad, I just think it desperately needs these features.";14 May, 2022;

ANNO: Mutationem;A;NOT INFORMED;93 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 31.7 hrs on record;"Edit, I have now finished the game, it took me around 28 hours as I took my time reading everything and talking to everyone multiple times. (Some NPCs will have more dialogue even after their quests are finished.) Everything else in the review still stands. Though with regards to the ending I do wish that a few of the characters that were introduced mid act III had been established before hand to make them a bit more relevant. Though the complaints about the ending I've seen are a overblown, yes the opening is somewhat open, but it's still pretty satisfying overall as you do defeat the big bad and get your brother and Ayane back. The ending definitely sets up a sequel, and I look forward to seeing Ann run missions for the Consortium in the future. So I'm around 4-5 hours into the game at this point, which has given me enough time to try out a few combat instances, fight a number of varied enemies, clear one boss fight, and unlock access to all the mechanics. From what I can see, this is definitely worth the money I spent on it, and I'm very happy with my purchase so far. The characters are fun and varied, a number of the more important conversations and the cut-scenes are voice acted, pretty solid VA work all around, especially the main cast, they're quite good. The dynamics between certain characters are fun as well, though there is a certain primary character who gets a little bit much, but that's more of a personal critique than anything. On the combat front, you have melee as your primary attacks, as well as a gun with finite ammo as your ranged option (it is quite strong and doesn't feel weak compared to the melee), and you have a shield and an array of consumables. As you complete missions and gain skillpoints, you can invest points into various skills for new combos, better stats, defensive options, etc. Overall a decently fleshed out skill tree which puts many larger titles' trees to shame. The writing itself is fun and somewhat cheesy, this is not going to be taught in literature classes as peak fiction, but it does have good moments and plays off the tropes pretty well in a nice way. I recall seeing an NPC lecturing another on how consumerism is bad and how idol culture is designed to keep us busy, and then pauses to show his delight at the news that a new virtual idol product was out for purchase. Fun little stuff like that is all around. Going on to the vibe of the game, the music is quite good and varied with great combat tracks, good ambient tracks, and just a nice presence to elevate the mood of the game. My personal favorite track so far has to be the ""The Sicilian Jar"" Bar, which just blends electronic and jazz very nicely. And finally, the most important part of the ambiance, and what drew me to the game in the first place, the amazing art. The game just looks beautiful, from Ann's many outfits, to the weapons, the various enemy designs, the different city hubs that you visit, the lighting, it's all very very well done and very pleasant to look at. So overall, yes, I definitely recommend this game to people who like games in the genre, art style, and gameplay.";17 March, 2022;

Only instead of being a one for one continuation their are aspects borrowed from Super Metroid,Parasite Eve,Ghost In The Shell,Metal-Gear-Revegeance, Nier Automata and Deus Ex as well! In Shadowrun there was something called ""The Awakening"". It turned certain people into mythical races such as dwarves,elves,orcs, and trolls as well as the assortment of similar ""other-folk"". Something similar happens in Anno only instead it was a mutative nanite virus,infecting humans and gradually turning them into living machines. Similar to ""cyber psychosis"" in Cyber-Punk,many of these infected became mindless killing machines after the last vestiges of their humanity were stripped away by mechanization.This explains why the main protagonist Ann's dad looks like a robot and why certain other people have mechanical limbs. ""Augmentation"" is not always a willing choice for the people in Anno's universe. However, society has learnt to ""get by"" and in some cases use mechanization to its' advantage. It's an interesting premise and another way to add cyber-punk elements via a macguffin not as often explored.It surprised me to learn Anno Mutationem rubbed quite a few gamers the wrong way.";2 April, 2023;

The Bus;SourLimes;108 products in account;134 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Not Recommended 10.0 hrs on record;It's difficult to review this game, as it stands, it's only really a demo. The problem is you're paying (at this time) £21.95 for a game that gives you the ability to drive two routes and quite literally nothing else.If we forget the price, this game has the potential to be fantastic, the modern OMSI. Sounds need some work, but drive-play and physics are really fantastic. Optimisation for 1.8 was god awful, 1.9 has made the game more playable with much less stuttering, but there's far more to do.Buying the game is risky, if they complete it then it's absolutely worth it, but if it get's canned and no more development time goes into it then you're left £22 out of pocket for game that offers nothing more than a couple of 45 minute driving sessions.As things stand, it either shouldn't have been released, or released in it's current state as a free to play demo with the promise of a more complete paid version later down the road. Calling a game Early Access isn't an excuse to charge a full-release price for a game that isn't even in what could be reasonably considered a beta.You might disagree but I find this game nothing more than a master of potential with a promise still to be fulfilled. For now, I don't recommend, but once the game get's to a better stage, I'll come back and update this.------------------------------------02/08/22It’s been a while since I posted this review, what’s changed?We’ve seen the release of 1.10 & 1.11, the key point being optimisation. As previously mentioned, it was highly questionable, though I'm pleased to say it runs well in the current builds, though that’s running a 3070 so do be mindful.With 1.11 came the addition of a new line, which is welcome but seems slow and almost too little progress given that’s the only major release we’ve had. Now yes, I know we’ve also had other little bits, the bus stop live displays which while cool, don’t actually seem to follow the schedule for the route I’m on? As in if I’m late it doesn’t say “late” or delayed, instead simply updating the departure time. If that’s true to Berlin then do ignore me, but in the most worldwide places, a timetable will display late minutes or just delayed. If this is to be updated or added, awesome.The new Atron ticketer is a nice addition too, took me a hot minute to figure out but once you do it’s nice and simple. Adds something a little more in-depth and immersion grabbing for a game that currently, doesn't offer much. All in all, these updates while very slow and not “packed” are still progress and welcome progress at that. With all that in mind, looking at the project phases, phase 1 does seem to be on the verge on completion. Looking on:Phase 2 Highlights:- Multiplayer free play- AI buses- Two new bus variantsPhase 3 Highlights:- Single player Economy mode:- create your own bus company- Buy vehicles and hire staff- Maintain and repair the vehicles of your fleet- And generate income via ticket sales- Multiplayer mode for Economy- Additional bus line 245 with various routes- Final bus variant- AI tramsLooking at that list of phases, I feel this could be 3 or 4 years’ worth of work based on current release patterns and speed, by which point the next big bus game has already been developed, released and had a couple years of DLCs and improvements. Hoping that work on phase 2 starts soon if not already in development, maybe we’ll see a more robust and frequent release schedule and I can go back and eat my critical words! The reason I keep being so critical is because this has so much potential and I’d hate to see it fail!I think it's also worth noting that throughout my all be-it not extensive playtime, I have encountered bugs, ranging from vehicles not stopping at junctions to the bus outright giving up for no apparent reason. An interesting one I had recently was driving down a street all the lamp posts started falling over, which caused so many issues!I'm hoping that some of you find this review helpful, I'll continue to try to keep this up to date! I still stand by my original review in that I don't think this is worth the price, yet.;6 January, 2022;

And you can forget about sales as well.

The next day I opened Steam and I was banned from the Community Hub of this game.That's reason enough for me to ask for a refund. But I'll elaborate my opinion about the game and about what you can expect:I own Fernbus and Tourist Bus Simulator, with most of the DLC's. Same developer and same publisher. Tourist Bus Simulator is basically Fernbus, but with a few tweaks and on a small island. Well, The Bus is the third time they sell the same game, with a few tweaks and a different map.All of them have the same flaws and a lot of bugs. I understand people are forgiving with The Bus and all the bugs that it has because it's in Early Access and bugs are to be expected. People see a promising game that could be great if it ever gets improved. But bear in mind that Fernbus is almost 5 years old and it still has big issues. Fernbus was promising too, but they never delivered. You will read that they're developing modding tools. Well, they said that about Fernbus in 2017, 2018, 2019,...

I WILL UPDATE this review once big changes are implemented or the game releases! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-> BETA UPDATE 1.2, Changes marked with ""/""-> BETA PHASE 2.0, Changes marked with ""#""---{Graphics}---The quality of the textures of the two Scania models is actually REALLY NICE and VERY detailled. You can even see the leather pattern on the steering wheel! The problem is the world itself. The buildings look flattened and a bit ""printed"". They don't have any details (other than maybe a store name and a picture of the store). This make it look a bit unreal and I hope they optimize this in the future./ As for the beta Update 1.2, the buildings start to be more detailed. What improved the most I think would be the light reflections, I played the game after the update with rainy weather and the light from other cars reflected really nice in the windshield of the bus and on the street. The raining animation is also very detailed and looks a lot more realistic! # I really like the way the map gets more and more ""busy"" (e.g. moving cranes, KI-trains like the Berliner S-Bahn)! I can't remember for sure but the logos of brands are represented more around the map (which is a bonus for me).---{Gameplay}---? Very good? Good? It‘s just gameplay? Mehh? Starring at walls is better? Just don‘t-> I think this is self-explaining: Well, you are driving a bus. Thats it! The bus itself is somehow limited at it's features, you f.e can't change the destination displayed on the outside or on the inside or can't pull down the sun visor (atleast in Early Access!). / For the beta Update 1.2, the game has still limited features and other than the driving mode you are left with the editor. For the future, they teaser stuff like carrier mode and such, but I think they will come when the game goes out of Early Access. # Sadly, it has been 2 full years and we are still limited to the single-driving-mode. I do understand that the different modes are a huge addon to the game and it will take a lot of time to create them, but I hope we don't have to wait another year! Furthermore, I cannot get the Multi Display Feature to work (to buy tickets off my Laptop for example!). that really is a bummer. What I am really exited about tho are the real-time events! Unfortunately they only appear when the radio station goes live (every friday ~7 pm I think) but it really adds to the realism when the reports of live events can be heard ingame via radio. I enjoy playing with the Mercedes E-Citaro but would love to be able to control more switches and things on the board computer interface! As an example, it does not let me buy a different ticket than what the passenger requested which is not realistic. There is a lot of potential to resolve these situations (f.e. talking with the passenger about it, then having to cancel the order or smth.)Additionally, being able to pick up any leftover trash is great, but nothing happens when approaching a garbage can and choosing the option to throw trash in it.---{Audio}---? Eargasm? Very good? Good? Not too bad? Bad? Earrape-> I have to say it: The audio is AWESOME. At least for the bus. While driving, you hear a quiet hum from the motor, which is nice. Every feature has it's own sound, and they did not copy sounds a lot. I personally think the door sounds by far the best! After you closed them, the seals do like a little squiik, it is so satisfying!!! / The audio did not change, in my opinion.# The audio did not change, in my opinion. For the Mercedes, the ""electric engine"" sound could be a bit louder.---{PC Requirements}---? Check if you can run paint? Potato? Decent? Fast? Top Notch(?) Ask NASA if they have a spare computer-> Let me explain this one: If you turn the graphics down by a lot, yea, then you can maybe play it on mom's old computer. The graphic use is INTENSE. For the minimum requirements it wants you to have a GTX950 MINIMUM, and for the recommended requirements it wants you to have a RTX2060. Like Aerosoft and TML, what do ya think??? We aint got money like dat! I use my GTX960 and the game runs fine on low settings, but already struggles if I turn up the side mirror quality. I hope this will get optimized a bit better in the future!/ Unfortunatly, the game still has big issues concerning the performance. It is a must-have to turn on V-Sync, otherwise you get stutters and frame overlays which are terrible to look at. With V-Sync enabled, I get less stutter, but while loading I have 17 FPS. I turned motion blur off, but it seems that it is still enabled in a weird way (btw, I upgraded to a GTX980 and reinstalled the game). # In the meantime I have actually upgraded to an Intel i9 9900k and a GTX 2080 (my dream rig!). I have to set everything to high instead of ultra because otherwise it gets stutter-y fast. Especially when considering mirror quality!---{Game Time}---? Long enough for a cup of coffee? Short? Average? Long? To infinity and beyond-> There are currently only two routes available. This will change in the future.

The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs-> I can't really vote on this, because it obviously has bugs (otherwise it would not be Early Access, LOL). It even warns you when you start the game, which is nice!/ Beta Update 1.2 fixes indeed a lot of stuff, and for the most part I actually haven't seen any bugs other than one or two having to do with steering in a while. # Other than my trial and error with the Multi Display Feature and some fps drops, the game runs as it should.

Call of Cthulhu®;Baron;NOT INFORMED;534 people found this review helpful15 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 11.5 hrs on record;I'll be honest: I really don't like that I have to give this game a negative review. But it honestly shouldn't even have Cthulhu in the title.As a big fan of Lovecraft, I was very excited about this game, and even purchased and played through the 2006 game Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth in anticipation. But after finishing this latest installment in the mythos, I am quite disappointed.This game wasn't necessarily bad. It was generally fun, with only a few minor flaws in the gameplay and some things that could have been better polished. The main things that bother me are its length, story, and its relation to the Cthulhu mythos.It took me 11 hours to complete this game, but it felt like it shouldn't have been nearly that long. The game's 14 chapters are largely cutscenes, and in the times when you do get to explore a bit, you are usually limited to an extremely small area. Interact with a couple of items in the area and it's on to the next cutscene and the next chapter.Don't get me wrong, I don't normally have a problem with cutscenes. I appreciate a good story-driven game, but the story here left a lot to be desired. The characters were very interesting, but they weren't used well. Some of their relationships with each other and with the overall plot still didn't make sense by the end of the game, and there were a lot of untied loose ends that left me quite unsatisfied.On top of those things, this game really didn't have much to do with the Cthulhu mythos. There were passing references to Arkham, Miskatonic University, Professor Armitage, and the Necronomicon. And the game did focus on concepts of insanity, forbidden knowledge, and occultism, which typically characterize Lovecraft's work. But the story didn't feel like it was built around those concepts the same way the mythos is meant to be. Instead, it felt like they were simply running down a checklist of things they had to include to be able to use Cthulhu in the title.There was one especially significant way in which the game diverges from Lovecraftian fiction. The whole genre of cosmic horror which Lovecraft developed is meant to exploit our fear of things that are unknown, unfamiliar, and overshadowing. Things that we are powerless to fight against and that are often too strange to even comprehend. Bizarre alien species, inconceivably massive and ancient entities, and even unknowable horrors are what make the Cthulhu mythos truly terrifying. But instead of using these things, the developers opted for a generic, forgettable, humanoid monster. Even the otherworldly being you meet later in the game is nothing more than a transparent human being.In short, this game really isn't about Cthulhu, beyond some very loose references to Lovecraft's writings, the inclusion of Cthulhu in the title, and his very brief appearance in one of the potential endings. At best, this is a run-of-the-mill horror game with some allusions to the Cthulhu mythos. Not a bad game, but not good at being what it wants to be either.If you want a good Cthulhu game, I would recommend going back to Dark Corners of the Earth. It is much more true to the spirit of the mythos, and was an overall more satisfying experience, despite being dated. Better yet, pull up some Lovecraft audiobooks on YouTube and let them play while you relax. Just be sure to keep the lights on...;15 December, 2018;

It fits. - I'm on chapter 3 and I don't think I can put it down, now that we're getting into the story. - The protag is quite likeable. It's nice to play as a character who has problems and feels like a person, not a hero. - No crashes so far, but this may vary for other players & builds, so don't take my word for it.- Investigating and evidence gathering is interesting.- Like Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness in a video game form, which is a big plus for me, as I love those board games. Things to improve:- The animations. Seriously, they feel half-assed. No excuses. please take the time to work on them and give us a patch with improvements. - The camera/focus is all over the place at times. (Example: jumps from character to character in an awkward way.)- FOV, or lack of it. Again, hopefully it'll be adressed. Edit: Finished it and loved it.

Call of Cthulhu®;Vanguard;NOT INFORMED;105 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 7.7 hrs on record;"Realistically expect 8 hrs per playthrough and maybe 2 playthroughs.Beat the game in just under 8 hours trying to find everything, but apparently missing quite a bit. It's good for two playthroughs (sane and insane). There are 4 endings, which I've already gotten two since it's very easy to go back and change things to get a different ending once you've beaten it. Realistically you can only get two endings per playthrough, because again, sane and insane make a difference. It's purely an investigation RPG, so don't expect combat. There's a very small section of the game you get to use a gun but it's more along the lines of ""push button if you want this NPC to die"", there's no aiming or anything. Not even an ammo counter. Again, essentially NO COMBAT. Choices matter kinda, but not nearly as much as you'd hope. Most unlock dialogue options if anything. The choices that make the most impact are the ones regarding your sanity, and those ones are pretty clear. It felt like most of the decisions I spent time mulling over never made a real difference, which was a dramatic disappointment. I'll update this part if I do another playthrough.Gameplay can be... rough. There are short stealth sections that play like Outlast, as in enemies with set routes that are incredibly easy to get around once you figure it out, if they see you you have the opportunity to run and hide. This is also unfortunately super easy to do. Despite the fact the main character seems to run at a mallwalker pace, you can escape most enemies without too much trouble. Most of the game revolves around dialogue and using your skills in dialogue, and while there are some actual skill checks akin to the tabletop game, I have no idea if these checks succeeded because they don't tell you if they succeed or not. Most skill checks in dialogue are threshold based, where if your skill is high enough you have that dialogue skill option. These also help with the reconstruction scenes, which are fun an interesting but can get bogged down by trying to find whatever tiny thing the game wants you to find that isn't super obvious until you've done 4-5 laps around the room. The story and investigation part of the game really shine though, you don't have to pay attention but if you do there are dozens of ""aha"" moments when pieces start falling together, especially if you go through your clues. I was mostly interested in this game for the storytelling so I got exactly what I wanted out of it. I played from when the game was released to when I finished it, and I never once thought of stopping because I was so interested in the story. Should be noted though that I'm a huge Lovecraft fan so people unfamiliar with his stories and themes of not knowing wtf is going on until it's too late might not like it as much.My biggest issue with it personally is there is a very abrupt point of no return that's unlike many other games, in that you can't even open the character menu anymore with all your clues and everything you've found in the game. The button simply stops working. So, once you get past a certain point near the end, if you want to review the clues in the game and reread them for extra story exposition, you can't. You'd have to start the game completely over and find them all over again. I didn't read some stuff because I was near the end and excited to finish but now I never can unless I playthrough again and again max out my Spot Hidden skill. Overall I'd recommend if you like Lovecraft's stories and want something true to the source material.";30 October, 2018;

Caliber;Dharok;NOT INFORMED;160 people found this review helpful; Recommended 35.5 hrs on record;This game is surprisingly pleasant. Me and a friend typically impulse download f2p shooters in hopes we can find a dumb fun one like the old days of War Rock and other f2p games. Five hours in and we have tried each class with the assorted operators they give you as an option. So here is my baby's experience review of Caliber.Gameplay feels like a f2p shooter, you know what I'm talking about.Graphics and sounds are pretty solid.Voice Acting is...lacking. But it's f2p, so not really a review breaking aspect.PvE is a pretty fun experience, the couple of modes I tried are pretty straight forward, shoot some NPCs, finish the mission, collect XP.PvP isn't that bad of an experience, the time to kill is fair and the modes are pretty basic if you ever played any shooter.There is also a PvPvE mode, where you capture intel and control points while combatting an enemy team of players and fighting NPCs around the map.Now let's get to the bit that truly matters in a f2p game. Microtransactions. In the five hours I've played this game, it's tossed several operators at me, and plenty of credits (Earned currency). There is obviously a premium currency called Coins you can use to unlock operators and cosmetic. In my opinion this game is NOT pay to win, but pay to progress.You can buy everything that matters to gameplay with Credits AND Coins. Nothing in the game only requires the premium currency.TLDR. On an impulse, I downloaded this game, and it's really solid for a F2P game, better QoL than most AAA games which is kind of funny, and the PvP, PvE and PvPvE modes are all pretty fun, especially with friends. I recommend it, a 7.5/10 f2p game with the ability to earn everything without spending a dime. Note. Of course, paying real money helps you progress faster. But really not required.;29 April, 2023;

It has great gameplay and details that many games would like. I have put many hours into it and have participated in many events including first person view and victory day. There is a great selection of agents and each with their respective weapons and skills. It is certainly a great successor to SOCOM. I recommend you to play onslaught on max difficulty, that is fighting.But now comes the bad part that I have been observing over time and I think it's time to point out.Since I started playing this game I have seen how the devs have made wrong decisions. One of them is that now to level up your agent it is necessary to invest coins or duplicates, before with extra points you could go up quickly. Another change that irritated me a lot was the change of the battle pass. Before, you would buy a battle pass and you would get a random agent. Now they have fragmented it into four parts and you have to pay 4 times for each agent, in addition, the skins for other agents are distributed in other passes, forcing you to buy another pass if you want that skin.And finally, the increase of the skin of payment. It is not normal that in 2021 the skin of the old school Seal would cost 9.95$ and now 16.5$ and so on. They have started to go a little overboard with the microtransactions and I bought many of them at the time because they are very cool, but exploiting the goose that lays the golden eggs is too much. I know it's a F2P, but inflating prices is not right.Hopefully this negative review will be enough to make the devs retrace their steps. Otherwise I recommend you to play the game because it is a great game.;12 April, 2023;

Caliber;LordBuckethead;NOT INFORMED;130 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 55.6 hrs on record;Generally, Caliber is honestly not a bad game. I actually find myself quite hooked. But I cannot, in my good conscience, recommend a game with such a greedy microtransaction scheme.For a Free-to-Play (F2P) game, it offers a lot. Fun Co-Op, PvP, and a unique PvPvE game mode. Each game mode is designed to pressure every player to work together - even a veteran player with a max-level premium operator would still find it difficult to solo a Point Sweep (PvE) map. Difficulty can be highly challenging (this is a major positive point for me!), giving a strong incentive to team-up with friends who can coordinate and cooperate. The game has an OK-ish difficulty scale-up level - such as power-ups, buffs, debuffs, enemy types, etc, so it's not a simple bullet-sponge-enemies system. The graphic is not state-of-the-art, but is already perfectly decent, equivalent to a ~2010s game. The operators are very well-researched and well-designed (e.g. operator equips matching magazines in their mag pouches). They use the real weapon's name as well, which is a plus for immersion. The maps, although limited, offers a good amount of scenario variety. Overall, the game offers a pleasant experience.However, there are some highly questionable gameplay designs that have a relatively major impact upon my enjoyment of the game. First, the PvP mode does not reset your items on each round. Forcing you to resupply all your ammo in the beginning of the round. The catch is, the ammo box needs about 15 minutes to cooldown while each round only takes about 3 to 5 minutes. I see no point in such a quirk. Downed players in PvP can also still move around for a limited time period. This causes kills to feel significantly less rewarding and dampens the effect of kills on the team's effort towards victory. The 'downed but can move' mechanism is weird implementation of a Battle Royale mechanism in a fast-paced, CQB PvP. There are many other oddities that I cannot list here one by one. As someone who is used to play competitive PvP games, Caliber's PvP experience in general has been rather dreadful. In PvE, my biggest gripe is the enemy's spawn point locations, lack of bullet penetration system, and the Rocketeer bot. Bots appear to be designed to spawn in the best-possible spot to flank the players. Considering the bots do not produce any footstep sounds, this often gives us no time to react. Rocketeer bots are even worse - they spawn with their incendiary RPG already aimed at us and fires almost immediately without even properly aiming. Bot spawn system need some serious rebalancing. And of course, bullet penetration is already some sort of a norm in modern-day shooter games. They actually do have a bullet penetration system - but guess what? You'll have to unlock an operator for it because it's an operator-unique skill! This dangerously creeps towards a slippery slope to splitting and selling game mechanics that are supposed to be an essential part of the game.There are also some negative points that do not affect the gameplay, but causes a persistent cringe. First, the voice actors, including the narrator, are absurdly bad. Combine that with a very poorly-written script that sounded like a kid who watched one too many action movies. It's eerily analogous to those fake NATO radio chats that the Russians are spreading to prove NATO soldier's presence in the Ukrainian frontline. The AI's movements are also not great, moreover realistic. Last but not least, the mission storylines are often times completely illogical in a military operation sense.Now let's address the elephant in the room: The microtransaction. I shall mention some of their worst atrocities here so that you can get a good picture on their insane greediness:1. Their latest Battle Pass (the BOPE operator series) is divided into 4. Each quarter part is being sold for a full Battle Pass price in other games, so the total would be around USD 60 (my store is in a different currency so it's an estimation).2. Each PvE round, with a +200% XP boost AND a premium account, only awards between 500 to 2000 credits (mostly 1000). Most of the credits gained would have to come from the Daily and Weekly quests (and the free Battle Pass if it's in season). An operator costs between 100.000 to 200.000 credits and EACH operator costs about 250.000 credits to reach max-level. And that does not include the prestige level. Prestige level 1 already costs 420.000 credits.3. In a multi-item box, you can only choose between one to two items from it. To get the rest, you will have to pay about USD 5 each. Um, I PAID for the box and I still have to pay again to get all the content? 4. A skill in the skill tree can only be unlocked by leveling-up the operator with a corresponding skill. This means that if you have a certain build you would like to pursue, you have no choice but to unlock AND level-up the operator who owns the skills that you want all the way up to level 12 - that's about 100.000 credits not including the cost of the operator.5. There are obviously 'good' and 'bad' operators. No, it is not about balancing - I understand balancing ~60 characters is challenging and time-consuming. The core design of the operator was clearly designed to make good and bad operators. In other words, not spending any money in the game will make you struggle against 'Tier S' operators in PvP...until you have farmed enough credits to get an operator who is also 'Tier S'. Grinding for a complete PvP-ideal build would be dreadfully long in the current pace.Now, I am not against microtransactions in a F2P game - especially the ones that do not interfere with the gameplay such as in Warframe. To further support my point, you should know that I have spent a significant sum of money in Caliber because I legitimately enjoy the gameplay. However, Caliber's microtransaction system feels incredibly petty and irradiates a strong sense of laziness and money-milking. Lots of the contents are re-used or split into multiple parts. They have the audacity to split Battle Pass skin into two parts. You need part 1 and 2 to actually use the skin. That is just unbelievably, outrageously, petty.Caliber has proven itself to be the ultimate embodiment of the gaming industry's greediness. The apex predator of those uninformed, innocent new players who are dipping their toe on online gaming - unaware that it contains psychological exploits that can lead them to an endless money sinkhole. Caliber's greediness is even worse than EA, and even worse than those Asian MMO games. I mean, even The Sims 4 still attempted to offer new contents in their exorbitantly-priced DLCs. If you still would like to play Caliber, I would say go for it. Being a F2P game, bring 3 of your friends since the public community is unsurprisingly deeply toxic and overly-competitive. Even if you still succumb to the microtransaction, I'd still recommend the Starter Pack for a proper value. The game itself, I would say, can be valued at about USD 15. But do not wander too far off the microtransaction trail, or you would be an enabler of an unashamedly rapacious gaming company that is taking part in creating a dystopian future of online gaming.;4 June, 2023;

The tag line that interested me in this game was, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Well, I found that to be completely false. The game does a lot really well, such as the ability to tweak and curve your designs, and map your programming out for ease of use. But trying to make vehicles for air and sea proved to be frustrating in a major way to me. The Good+ Very free-form chassis crafting. The ability to bend bars, and tweak the precise lengths and angles of everything (on a square grid) is very nice. It certainly lets you run wild with your imagination+ Command Map lets you see exactly what you are having different key-binds doing on your build. It can be a huge help when you aren't sure what is causing your creation to malfunction+ The world and materials are simply lovely. The graphics aren't overly flashy, but they are relaxing and beautiful.The Bad- An annoying set of tools for center of gravity and thrust vector, that all kind of just overlay onto each other. Maybe I missed how to cycle through these tools one at a time, or maybe...- The tutorial is ridiculously sparse. It explains some of the basic tools and how to use them, and then tells you to go to YouTube if you need more *knowledge*. The Tutorial doesn't cover buoyancy, aerodynamics, or lift.- There seems to be no Aerodynamics viewer. Now, this isn't a terrible issue in and of itself, but when paired with the fact that there are not pre-made wings and you have to design them, this tool (or a smoke/wind tunnel) would be a huge improvement.The SummaryI think this is a good game. I feel like it will only get better and better as the community expands and shares more ideas. However, when compared to a couple of titles that where already in the genre, the game feels like it is lacking in some areas. I would say this game is worth it if you can get a 15%+ discount. At 20$(USD) it feels just a touch steep for me.";28 January, 2021;

This is with only two or three players, not huge servers.- When melding the shape of chassis pieces the game fairly regularly twists the grid by 45 degrees for no reason, making it impossible to make the correct adjustment without deleting and rebuilding the plate.- It has some extremely annoying behaviour with even the most basic designs, wheels will bounce and veer off course even on perfectly geometrically flat terrain making even the simplest cars completely unreliable without thruster assistance. I have no idea what the game wants me to do that might fix this, every workshop vehicle just uses internal thrusters to cheat the physics.- There's very, very little to do. Bot Brawl doesn't seem to allow any real customization and there's a huge lack of weapons that aren't the smallest block size possible, world logic design is also very obtuse and isn't clustered in a UI like vehicles and is instead a bunch of floating blocks you must fly around to connect which is incredibly tedious.It might one day be good, but this game is ABSOLUTELY still in fairly early Early Access and has absolutely no right to be calling itself a released product. Even the most basic behaviour for an engineering game will cause hard crashes and unpredictable physics anomalies.I will change this review the absolute second I find any of these issues are fixed because this is absolutely fixable.;19 April, 2021;

However it also has its flaws.Let me explain, so first there is the programming, which is a really cool and easy to learn system where you can use stuff like averages, exponential curves and trigonometry to make cool builds, however there's close to no point in using these complex programming nodes as the aerodynamics system barely affects the vehicle (rendering stuff like active aerodynamics and air brakes useless, also i haven't been able to make a helicopter because of this) so my main gripe is that the aerodynamics are not strong enough (or they don't exist, however it says you can build planes and there is a helicopter in the cover art so i believe it exists to some extent)i might just be doing it wrong but i havent noticed anything in the way of aerodynamics (i got the same lap times with a box as i did a aerodynamic car, and as i said i couldnt build a helicopter) so if any of you (including devs) could confirm this for me this would be greatBut that's really the only thing that truly breaks the game for me. the building system takes a bit of time to learn but once you learn it it is really simple and honestly the best I've seen yet (kind of like a simplified version of blender which you make a car shape with and then stick wheels on and stuff) There also isn't much content in the game however its in early access so i cant complain (offline racing against bots would be nice, As well as leaderboards).so to sum this up, this is a fun game with a building system which has the potential to be amazing, however the physics limit it a lot, and in this current state there isn't a massive amount of single player content (there's missions and a sandbox);29 June, 2020;

The controls are a little wonky to start with and the building ""flow"" seems un-intuative at first. But it doesn't take long to figure out how things work. If you have any experience with 3d animation or model building, this is definately in that ""wheelhouse"". This feels more like working with clay, than sticking blocks together. There's a decent amount of additional add-on pieces like hinges and servos, as well as pistons and specialized tools like the suction cup or drill head. The physics in-game are decent as well. Although, to me, the atmosphere feels thin. When taking off in a flyer, it feels more like your breaking the surface friction, than pushing yourself through the air resistance. The Programming portion of the game can get a little scary when you first start using it, but it only needs to be as complicated as you want it to be. Simple things like Power and Steering for a vehicle are pretty straight forward and the game tries to help by having some of these attributes built into certain parts. Which allows you to start building creations without the stresses of programming.To sum up, I'm only 17hrs into the game, but I'm hooked:) This game can only get better from here.See you on the Assembly Line:)";13 December, 2020;

I love pinball but have not generally been a fan of ""fantasy"" virtual pinball.The main exception to this rule has been the ""Crush"" series: Alien Crush, Devil's Crush (Dragon's Fury on the Genesis), and Jaki Crush (My personal favorite). As stated many times, this is obviously a homage/spiritual successor to the series, especially Devil's Crush, invoking the similar ""Face in the middle playfield"".The art is excellent and I like the music, especially in the bonus tables. I think the particle effects are impressive. The game runs at least a solid 60FPS at 4K, on a machine where I can't play most of my games at 4K. I also have this on my Switch and it runs very solid there too.If I were to have any complaints, it'd be mainly:- I agree with another reviewer in that the ""pink"" projectiles are annoying. I find myself constantly just waiting them out and it really interrupts the flow of the game for me. They can be unpredictable and often there's so many (*Especially* on the bottom playfield) that I don't want to risk the ball draining. I don't think it ruins the game for me, though, and maybe others like that challenge or can handle it better (I'm *not* an amazing player by any stretch)- I really wish this had an actual Linux build. I mainly run this on Linux with Proton, and most of the time it runs perfectly fine, on-par with the Windows version. However, if I switch focus from the window, it usually crashes the game. And occasionally, the game just starts up and runs slowly for no discernable reason, 30 fps or lower, and I can't seem to get it to run normally again until I reboot. I've tried running it with/without gamemmode, different Proton version, checking anything else using resources, etc..I know the support can be difficult and inconsistent for Linux clients. I'd be happy if it was just marked beta. I have some other Unity games on here exported natively that run perfectly fine - Cities Skylines and Sudden Strike 4 off the top of my head.To address other complaints, ball visibility can be annoying when there's a million things going on. Turn on ball trails in the options, and try not to explicitly ""follow"" the ball as you're playing, you want to keep the whole playfield in perspective.I found the muffled voices annoying at first too, I had no clue what she was saying. I will say that most of the callouts are also in text on the screen somewhere, and I mostly just got used to it.As for the ball draining easily, if you get used to nudging, you'll avoid most of the pitfalls. The tilt here is very forgiving. The one section I always have trouble with is the right outlane on the bottom. Whenever the ball hits the stacked row of floating enemies coming from there, it almost always wants to fall into the outlane because it lost it's momentum and I have a hard time saving it unless I just nudge it early/aggressively.Other than that, great game, one of my favorite recently for sure. Sorry for such a long-winded take! If you enjoy this and haven't played the Crush pinball series, definitely do! Jaki Crush was only released in Japan, but is 100% playable for English players. Somebody else mentioned Balls of Steel and I do also like that game, but it's sadly a bit of a pain to run on modern systems, especially if you aren't on Windows (I never could get it to work on a VM.. haven't tried Wine or Proton though)";3 January, 2020;

Anodyne 2: Return to Dust;CodeGorilla;210 products in account;35 people found this review helpful; Recommended 180.6 hrs on record;"I love, love, love this game. It's 1:30 in the morning, and I should be going to bed, but I just finished this game, and I need to write about it while it's fresh on my mind or I won't be able to sleep.Back in mid-2019, not long after this game came out, I picked it up and started playing it. Fairly quickly you get an idea of what the core gameplay loop is going to be: explore a 3D world, to find entrances to 2D Zelda-esque adventure sections. Explore the 2D sections to find dust and cards, and use the dust and cards to unlock new 3D sections. Pretty straight-forward. I got about halfway through the second (of five-ish) act of this before life got in the way, and I ended up abandoning the game. If this was all the game was, I'd be giving it about 3.5 stars.Well, this week I revisited this game and decided to start fresh, and I am so glad that I did. At the end of act 2, the developers basically throw that core gameplay out the window, and the resulting game has some truly great moments.The writing is easily the biggest strength of this game, as with the rest of the games this team has put out. This game manages to seamlessly meld the quirky and dark humor of Anodyne with the contemplative commentary on human nature presented by Even the Ocean. It manages both laugh out loud funny moments mixed with some real tear-jerkers, and even some moments of great tension, without any of it feeling forced or at odds with one another.The gameplay is solid and dependable. It's not the main draw to the game, but neither does it get in the way of things. The 3D sections are mostly about exploration, with the occasional moment of platforming, but the double jump and automatic glide means the platforming never feels punishing, and the Ridescale ability (i.e. your character transforming into a car) makes the necessary backtracking not feel like a chore. The 2D sections use a similar engine to the prequel, but the use of a vacuum cleaner as your primary weapon (allowing you to inhale and spit out enemies) keeps the game feeling fresh.The music does a fantastic job of setting the tone. the 3D sections all have an ethereal and somber feel to them, really giving you a sense that all is not well in the world. Meanwhile, the 2D sections (where more of the action tends to be) get themes that suit the moods of the individual areas. Highlights of the soundtrack for me include Upon Soaring Highways, Pastel Horizon, Stargaze Valley Night, and the theme for the last 2D section of the game, which I won't name because it's a pretty big spoiler.The graphics are the kind of retro graphics that I love - the kind that makes you think ""this could have been done on a 16-bit console, right?"" Yeah, they could have, but no one did, back then. What's new to me is a game that captures that feeling but for early 3D graphics. the 3D sections of the game simultaneously look like they could have been on the Playstation and also better than anything the Playstation actually produced.All in all, this game is fantastic. I'm so, so happy I came back to this game, as this is now genuinely one of my favorite games of all time. Would highly recommend for anyone who likes narrative-heavy games with a little action spread throughout.5/5";27 January, 2021;

I am a huge fan of this eerie oldschool look that games like Majora's mask shared. And this game really nails the creature designs and the 3D models. For those new to the Anodyne series like me, this game is a standalone story, so no need to worry about continuity.The 3D sections of the game, are where you'll get to soak in the melancholic environment. Sometimes characters say things that are disturbing, while other times it's sad or inspiring. I genuinely loved the emotions the game made me feel. In order to find creatures that need your help, you'll need to explore in these hub-worlds. To speed up your travels, you can turn into a car. It's a bit strange, but whatever. You might have to do a little bit of simple platforming at times, but other than that, the gameplay is a bit limited in these parts. That's because the real ""game"" part is the 2D sections of the game. These occur when you meet creatures in need of your help. In this world, a thing called Dust corrupts people from within. It makes them forget who they really are, and so it is your job to shrink to a microscopic level, enter them, and eradicate the dust. I thought this part of the story added a wonderful and ominous feeling to the overall world.Once you enter these people, you play in a top-down, pixel view of the game. Even the devs have compared it to the oldschool Zelda games. Although in this game there isn't such direct combat. You don't have a weapon necessarily.Instead, you use a vacuum-cleaner-like device to suck in enemies. You can then spit them out onto walls or other enemies to kill them. Most enemies will not be able to be sucked in directly like this, so you'll need to instead suck in a nearby object and hurl it onto them. This part of the game really grew on me, because the devs managed to make every single one of these instances increasingly interesting. The aesthetic is first of all unique to the creature that you are helping, as well as the music that plays. On top of that, the game varies up enemy types and puzzles, which are also themed to the creature. The game does a great job at intuitively teaching you a new mechanic, which you then build upon in later rooms. And right before you would have had enough of the mechanic, the level ends. They are short and sweet, and have you transition between both 2D and 3D sections of the game constantly.The game also introduces a 3D gameplay part, which has you running towards the creature before you enter it. You'll need to press the corresponding direction in order to block the crystals coming at you, until you reach the end. I found this gameplay to be less engaging than the 2D part. It's obviously meant to be a short mini-game bit, but I found it to be a bit boring. The game does shake it up by introducing things like ""black crystals"" that you must NOT press any button in order to bypass. I personally think something that would have made these sections a lot more interesting was if the crystals had to be hit in a rhythm. They didn't necessarily need to play out a song, but to have them come at you at a beat would have been interesting, because that's what vibe it gives when you see these sections anyway.As you cleanse more creatures, you'll unlock new areas of the game to progress to. I personally found it really rewarding to talk to these creatures after you've cleansed them. They're all memorable and have a small backstory to tell that can sometimes be tear-jerkers. The writing is in general good. On top of some nicely-written descriptions of some scenes, there can be some chuckle-worthy dialogue, which I appreciated.Overall, I love the game. And it's even more impressive when you find out it's made by only two people. I'm a huge fan of this kind of atmosphere, and this game delivers it perfectly. Every single song was amazing, and emotionally-charged. They all helped drive that undertone of sadness. Although I found the 2D parts very fun, I personally wish I could spend more time in the 3D world, because I love the look so much. Maybe in a sequel?Recommended!";12 August, 2019;

Anodyne 2: Return to Dust;an;NOT INFORMED;11 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 13.7 hrs on record;I played through the first Anodyne on my PS4 after hearing some good stuff about this game, and about half an hour into the original Anodyne I knew that I was going to have to buy this as well. You don't need to play the first one to appreciate Anodyne 2, as the vast majority of this game is unrelated to the first-- there are a few references here and there, but you can play this came through to the end credits without having any familiarity with Anodyne without missing anything. That being said, you should still play the first game, because it's weird and funny and does some interesting things. Having enjoyed the first game as much as I did, I had pretty high hopes for Anodyne 2, and they were almost entirely met. This game is weird as hell, in a good way, and it surprised me on more than one occasion. The music is well done and fittingly odd at times, the elements of exploration are compelling, the writing is good-- I saw a previous reviewer accusing it of telling rather than showing, and I didn't find that to be the case until perhaps the very end of the game. I have a low tolerance for bad writing in games, and even if some parts of it didn't hit the mark for me, the writing here was above par on average. The main complaint I would levy against the game is that it sometimes is a little too obtuse, particularly with a couple of puzzles in the last third of the game. None of the problems I ran into are what I would consider to be deal breakers, but they were momentum-slowing, and frustrating to run into towards the end of the game when everything else up until that point had been fairly solid. Don't let that dissuade you, though-- you're probably smarter than I am, and are unlikely to find it as bothersome as I did. I have faith in you.;22 September, 2019;

It's an n64/ps1-era styled game for the 3D exploration section of the game, but you can also shrink yourself to nano-scale inside people to explore 2D zelda-like worlds. For the entirety of my 7hr playthrough, I kept asking myself ""What is even happening???"". Very intriguing game, and one of the most interesting and fun experiences I've had on steam in a while. The mechanics are straightforward but fun. The exploration aspect is great, and there are tons of strange beings to see and interesting dialogue. There's also many secrets, some of which even require going ""out of bounds"". The first game in the series was pretty good, but this sequel blows it out of the water. I was hooked the whole way through, and never really felt lost (direction-wise... I was very much confused visually) Also, the spritework and music in the 2D areas is really well done.

But with the modern control scheme SF6 offers, I can not only play, but win against online players for the first time. It's like skipping straight past the entry barrier of learning inputs and getting straight on to learning fundamentals.

Street Fighter™ 6;Shotgunbadger;1,131 products in account;436 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 11.2 hrs on record;Street Fighter 6 is not only Capcom getting back in the saddle as part of the pantheon of fighting games makers, it's an evolution of the genre as a whole.If you have even the slightest interest in fighting games this is a must buy. The game is bursting with beginner friendly tutorials that can either be simple instructions or deep, precise, dives into frames and advantage states and such, including a deep selection of tutorials and challenges for each character to help you fully grasp them. Each character feels distinct too, they may have overlapping general 'niche' roles but nobody feels 'surplus' or 'padded'. Manon and Zangief may be both grapplers, but Manon's slow build momentum focus is a world apart from Big Z's brutal command grab heavy arsenal of unrelenting high risk high reward offense.Multiplayer is smooth and easy, able to be accessed from both the fantastic hub world full of fun details or just from the main menu if you want to jump right in, and provides plenty of chances to learn your way up the rankings before being thrown in with the pros.The option to switch between classic and 'modern' controls is great as well. Modern in no way feels like 'easy mode' or some crutch either, you sacrifice complexity for ease, and it's up to you to decide if easier supers and combos is worth losing some of the granularity of full control over your character's inputs. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' control system and you'll be matched with both types online, it's a preference issue rather than anything else.Singleplayer is equally well thought out, though. Arcade mode gives nice simple fights to explore a character and good story rewards, but the real star is it's massive World Tour mode where you make your own avatar to travel the world of Street Fighter meeting mentors and learning their styles. The overall story is fairly bland but the real draw is getting to find Chun-Li in Chinatown and get her to train you and building a relationship with her as a mentor to the point where you're texting with her randomly in the world and learning about what she's been up to since the past games as well as mastering her iconic moves.That's a detail that seems to go overlooked at times, this is the first SF game in ages to move the story forward. Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, they've all progressed as characters and have experiences to share instead of being the same rather flat characters we've seen for decades at this point. It feels like a proper 'passing of the torch' in some ways too, there's likely to never be a SF game without the 'core' cast like Ryu but the story lets the new blood feel like genuine up and coming street fighters to watch out for rather than just random additions.This is the Street Fighter most of us have been waiting ages for, and if you have even a passing interest in fighting games this is going to be a fantastic one to learn on.;3 June, 2023;

People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC. I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be.

EA SPORTS FC™ 24;DeBreeze;NOT INFORMED;359 people found this review helpful14 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 54.5 hrs on record;Okey after a long time I will finaly post a review of EAFC24 and the FIFA-franchise as a whole. Yes I know that it isn't called FIFA anymore.This gamefranchise from EA is sadly the only real way to scratch your itch if you are actually looking to play the game, not only manage it (Like FM). The way EA has done it has been insanely painfull to watch. I have played almost every game of FIFA (Now EAFC) since 2010 on console and now on pc and console. It has gotten worse every time, the features they add that are new and cool, they remove as fast as the next version is out. But I get ahead of myself, let me review this game.They put all of their marbles into FUT and Volta, this is where they milk their whales and scratch the itch of football gamblers. Around 30-40% of their playerbase is supposed to be people that play careermode, a gamemode they have taken a massive dump on, since 2016.1. The play it self is full of bugs, people glitching out, hitboxes not being in place etc.. I don't know how many times I have rewinded to see that a ball went through a leg or a bodypart because of the hitbox glitching. 2. The AI has become seemingly worse for every game. The AI reacts to everything as the input is put in on your end, but it seems like your players aren't doing it at the exact second, it has a small delay. Making the opponent seem like they are reading your mind. 3. The amount of scanned faces is just downright bad. A couple of days ago, started a new career, wanted to play a real manager. It is like less than 30 faces of real managers actually scanned into the game, because instead of putting people they have previously scanned into a folder at the end, they are just removed. I don't care if the small picture of my manager is his real face, when you never see that picture, but you always see the worst version of a fake model for a manager ever created. 4. Customization on the different platforms... You make a character on Volta or Clubs (the online gamemode vs other playercreated teams), you get access to a huge number of hairstyles, features, tattoos etc.. Those are not accessable on career at all. The jerseys you have on create-a-club is horrible, they say they added sponsors and it is just the Dice logo and an EA logo.. This was something they had on Fifa06, where you chose fake companies that added both a kitsponsors and some challenges to the gameplay to get more money into your save, that feature has still only been in that game.. 5. Kitsponsors.... For some reason, I don't know if it is licensing or whatever, but if you go online, on some teams, their sponsors disappear. I now have a save with Watford, if I am online, they have no main kitsponsor, if I go offline, they have. 6. Goalkeepers... Okey, I only have 2 issues with goalkeepers and I will keep it short. They can't save on their nearpost 90% of the time, they just can't, if it is the animations or how they are coded in positioning. I have no clue, doesn't matter if he is 50 rated or 91 rated, can't save it. Problem number 2 with keepers is the way they move, this might be a bug, but sometimes, when you force them out of goal, they seem to pull straight out, not regarding their position at all. So run straight out and the goal being fully open because of their movement. 7. The gameplay. Okey I will not ???? on the gameplay too much, just a tiny bit. For some reason, I still don't know why, this is how EA has treated the gameplay. 2018-2020 - Pace was king. 2021-2022 - Lay the ball into the box, and you will have most chances of scoring goals. In the last games they have added this feature and I still don't know why, powershot. Powershot is seemingly vs the AI the stupidest gameplay mechanic out there, they AI are in your face long before the animation is close to trigger and if they are for some reason not. There are 8 people in your way blocking it, seemingly disregarding every single teammate you have around them, just to block your shot. If you turn handball on in rules, you will have a literal ton of freekicks and penalties, but if you keep it off, they seemingly play handball due to animations and positioning. It's probably a lot of stuff I have forgotten to mention but this is what is in my head atm.Conclusion: Since there are no other good footballgame to play, sadly this is your only option. If you have played this series of games before, you know how bad it has gotten even with its newer shinier finish. I can't recommend it at full price at all. It is not worth it and if you love football, all the small things will annoy you. EA is getting worse and worse for every game they put out, so do not think the next one will be any better.Why can I be upset about this game: I have around 10k hours in Fifagames in total, most on console. I have followed Fifa since the original Xbox and the PS1, all the way up to PS5, gaming-pc and Xbox One X. I have both played FUT, Clubs, Volta, Be-a-pro and Careermode. Fifa and now EAFC are games I come back to, because I love football and because I see it as a chill pasttime.Hopefully this is helpful for the ones thinking about buying it. EA will never see this review or think about it, and will probably never change their ways.; 17 February;
EA SPORTS FC™ 24;Jan;NOT INFORMED;381 people found this review helpful30 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 184.7 hrs on record;UPDATED REVIEW:Please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours I have sunk into it.I won't be completely critical of the game and I'll give credit to a couple of things, most notably the gameplay. I like the animations and the motion of the players, they are fun to control. I play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great. Players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively (especially against ultimate difficulty) but with practice, you get there. Attacking is satisfying too, I like the different dribbling styles, although R1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered, but even still, I am happy that it's possible to dribble past players in this year's game and score some lovely solo goals. I play purely offline, as where I am currently located I just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience.HOWEVER - despite EA releasing updates, not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many MANY others face, which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some, lag and game crashes. I would not want to know how many of those hours I have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just won't play. Sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily, but upon the next launch, it just doesn't work again. This to me is unacceptable. They are aware of the problem, yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released. The hell I've been through to sort it should never be required to play any game. I paid £80, but I feel like EA owe me a year's salary for the amount of work I've done on their game for them. Crooks.Stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it. Imagine playing an F1 game, but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself, you've crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused £500 million worth of damage, you'd say 'Forget it' and toss it in the bin. The same goes for football games. You need precision and reactions because timing is important. You can't do that with 3-second stutters intermittently during a match. How can nobody have seen this? I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander.It was a new era for the franchise, a fresh start, so I allowed myself to believe that things may be different, but it just isn't the case for any of the offline modes. If you think adding cut scenes of players winning the Balon d'Or (where nobody even speaks other than some announcer, which freaks me out) and an open-top bus parade of trophies you've won (which is cool the first time, but it is the same every single time after) then you don't understand why we play football games - WE WANT TO PLAY, NOT SIT THERE AND WATCH SILENT MOVIES. Is this their attempt at making it more immersive? Disaster.True, some promising ideas were introduced, like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode, but here's the thing - that was bugged when it was released. Imagine working on a new feature, but for it not to work properly. What I mean is, that you can't fire coaches, you'll lock the game and have no chance to back out. I actually hope it doesn't get patched, because it doesn't matter, it tells us what we already know - they don't care. It's a shame because I think that if they'd just put more effort into it, this could've been a really good game. The foundation is there with the gameplay, and that's the heart of any good football game. But why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more? The amount of work they put into 'create a team' for example, which was just uninspiring, is what I am talking about. Put that work into actually making a comprehensive, immersive career mode. 'Create a team' was fantastic in the F1 game, it works in that circumstance, but for a manager mode on a football game? It isn't what we want. For those who can't be bothered to read all that: you'll feel just like Mugatu from Zoolander - It really is the same face.;14 October, 2023;

A KNOCKOUT! “Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”This is the very essence of Cuphead.

This is a full priced $70 game (with editions up to $100), yet still sells cosmetics that cost $20+, paid battle pass, AND future expansions will cost money. You can literally buy entire other video games for the price of some of these skins.Also this game needs to auto-save WAY more often, or let me manual save. I've lost like 30+ minutes of progress since I've needed to quit the game when it hasn't saved recently. Can't even just leave the game running until I can get back to it either since it will disconnect me for inactivity because diablo 4 is online-only even when playing single player.; 15 February;

Blizzard you lack all sense of vision, you dont make worth while games any longer. Money has clearly separated you from your long standing player base...but hey who is more worth appeasing the crowd that lined your pockets and carried you to the pinnacle of popularity within the genre or the board of directors and investors? Obviously the latter. Its been real, good riddance.EDIT: As of season 4 Blizzard is kind of making me eat my words. After putting 50 hours or so in play testing s4 I gotta give credit where it is due. I have to admit the game is in a much better place than it has been since launch. A great deal of QoL has happened and is leading to a more overall enjoyable experience for all different styles of players. I wont change the review just yet until the next season comes out because blizz is well known for one step forward and two steps back but if what is happening right now keeps moving forward the game will be very healthy and worth recommending to the community and interested new players. For people who already own the game definitely pop back in and check it out for yourself, for those looking to freshly purchase this $70 game with mtx I would still be hesitant because we could truly just be suffering to copium here after 3 very poorly executed seasons.; 24 January;

It just lacks so many of the addictive elements that made past entries work - namely, the multiplayer experience is garbage and has completely lost any sense of what one would consider to be an ""in-game, online community"". It's just not there. Sure, you've got your friends list and the chance enounter with randoms crossing your path - but gone are the glory days of doing runs with ""rooms"" of other players. No doubt, it's the most beautiful game of the genre, and it no doubt has better accessibility options than any other as well - but does that make it a satisfying or fulfilling game? It sure isn't enough. When so much of the game is a grind, you have to ask yourself - for what ends? If I'm not enjoying the journey to the end-game nor the end-game itself - why keep playing? So - I stopped. I've looked at its installed, ready-to-play status on my Steam library but I yawn in consideration of playing it any further as I continue to routinely pass it up for other, better games from this year. I enjoyed the first 12 or so hours I played during the free weekend but it's been nothing but a wet blanket ever since. I can't recommend this for the price.

The FPS won't be shown on things like MSI afterburner or steam overlay. If you want to see the fps being generated by the app, tick ""Draw FPS"" in the frame gen option on the lossless app itself.For example, a game like Elden Ring. Since it's capped at 60 fps in game (without mods), you can put your monitor's refresh rate at 120, turn the lossless app on and play 120 fps Elden Ring ONLINE. Yep, as it operates outside of the game, it doesn't trigger anti cheat.Another game which I used quite extensively is Baldur's Gate 3. Capped in game fps to 60, and turned on lossless and played the WHOLE game at 120 fps, including Act 3. As long as you can maintain 60 fps (or whatever half your refresh rate is) you'll enjoy max fps on any game.This app has cons however, it does introduce some input lag, so if you're playing online games like helldivers, it won't be the best. But games like BG3 is great because it doesn't require fast movement.Also, I didn't notice any input lag playing elden ring, because the game is designed around 60fps.Highly recommended app - 9/10With improvements to its functionality and input lag, I can see this app being perfect."; 20 April;

Little Nightmares;JonnyVal3ntyne;NOT INFORMED;262 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 20.5 hrs on record;Two words... Dark and Creepy. Little Nightmares is far from a horror game, but does just enough to make you feel uncomfortable while you're playing it. Set in a morbid cruise ship from hell where the guests like to feast on the flesh of children while they pig out like animals, you'll find yourself escaping from humanoid like creatures that truly are the products of nightmares. The story is amazing and you'll be left shocked and dumbfounded at the end, not really knowing what's going on because very little is actually explained, but enjoying every second of it nonetheless. The DLC's add even more onto that sentiment, leaving you in a state of despair and questioning yourself, why are we even here... just to suffer?Suffering and creepy elements aside, Little Nightmares truly is a beautifully done game with detailed artwork that breathes life into the dead carcass that is the Maw... you'll definitely want to play this one with the lights off though. The soundtrack only adds onto that, raising your heartbeat the closer you get to danger was something that really made me feel all the more immersed into the story and the ambient noises make sure you're always feeling tense as you traverse the the darkness. The gameplay itself however felt like the only shortcoming this game had, at least in my opinion. More than the unearthly local residents of the Maw, the number one thing that always got me killed was falling due to bad camera angles and choppy controls that would lead me plummeting to a premature demise. Being an Indie 3Dish puzzle-solving platformer I know I shouldn't be too demanding, but there was just something about the puzzles that didn't resonate with me... most of the time just by glancing around the room you would know exactly what to do and you could just breeze through all the chapters like there was no tomorrow, the whole game could probably be completed in about 2 hours (+1 hour w/ DLC's) so you'll definitely end up with a feeling of wanting more.That being said, Little Nightmares is still one hell of a game and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone who's thinking of giving it a try, but because of the moderate price and short length of the game I would suggest waiting for it to go on discount and buying the Complete Edition to get the most value out of your money.;3 May, 2021;

Brawlhalla;Tequila;NOT INFORMED;928 people found this review helpful26 people found this review funny; Recommended 2,796.1 hrs on record;The other day, I told myself I was going to play ranked with the only intention being to win, which meant playing fully passive and not caring what people thought of me. I quickly reached top 50 in the world doing this. Almost nobody gged me and plenty of people complained about my playstyle in post game chat. Admittedly, although I am never toxic to anyone regardless of how they play, I don't blame a single one of those people for their anger. Brawlhalla, when played at a high level, is legitimately one of the most frustrating fighting games to play in existence. Just imagine losing to someone after they avoided approaching you, wall camped, or outright ran away from you for the entire game. Considering this, it’s no wonder why Brawlhalla’s community is a cesspool of toxicity and noxious, salty fumes. As much as I want to give this game a negative review, I cannot justifiably do so. Most people who play this game will stay at a basic, casual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has. So, despite my frustration with Brawlhalla, I am giving it a positive review. My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously. However, the prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinum/low diamond, so be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hours.;21 June, 2017;

Infection Free Zone;A;NOT INFORMED;492 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 13.6 hrs on record;The concept of this game is great, and I love the fact that it can be played almost anywhere on the planet. However, there are some significant problems with the game that I cannot overlook, and for that reason, I have given it a negative review.(Looting) The looting in this game is initially fun, but it becomes tedious as you progress and have more people to manage. Micro-managing each squad to search every house becomes a nightmare, especially when you have multiple squads. It surprises me that they didn't think of implementing an auto-looting system to prevent it from becoming so tedious. Moreover, the looting in the game is especially problematic because it is almost necessary for survival. This makes the tedious nature of the task even more frustrating, as i am forced to spend a significant amount of time and effort on it.(Base building) At first, the base building in the game seems very fun and a nicely implemented feature. However, the more you play and the longer you progress in your game, the worse it gets. For instance, if you want to upgrade your wooden wall into a brick wall, you have to deconstruct the wall and build the brick one from scratch. Why isn't there an option to upgrade? That's not even the worst part, as when you do decide to upgrade your wall, you can only assign 3 people to the job, and if it's the best wall in the game, you'll have to wait 3 or 2 days for them to finish the wall. Why can't you assign more people to the job to speed up the process? Furthermore, the same limitations apply to watchtowers and other buildings you can construct. The lack of an upgrade feature and the slow progress of construction, even when assigning multiple people to the job, make base building a frustrating experience that detracts from the overall gameplay.(Story) As for the story, it's decent with some interesting events, but what I dislike the most is how it interrupts the gameplay. When something happens and you receive a radio call, the game either stops completely or makes it impossible to see important squad information on the right side of the screen due to the event. I hope they fix this issue, as it can be frustrating and disrupt the flow of the game.(Other things) Additionally, it's quite annoying that your people won't go out and work during a storm. I think there should be an option to take the risk of working in a storm, even if there could be zombies around. Losing an entire day of work due to bad weather can be frustrating, and I believe there should be an option to work even in poor weather conditions, with the added risk of zombies attacking your workers.(Conclusion) Despite the issues I've mentioned, I still think it's a good game, but the current problems outweigh the positive aspects. I hope the developers will address these issues and improve the game, as it has a great concept and so much potential. However, as of now, I cannot recommend it.; 16 April Ea;

Terraria;Bebojo;NOT INFORMED;2,959 people found this review helpful64 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,571.2 hrs on record;Terraria's latest major update, Journey's End (1.4) Labor of Love (1.4.4) is here. And it's great! I'll explain to all of you why I recommend Terraria. You should get this game right now since the game is essentially complete and is full of content (and thanks for all the feedback on my review! It's much appreciated).Intro:If I were to explain Terraria to someone quickly, I would put it like this: Terraria is a game that has a whole world to explore. You mine, build, craft, fish, and fight to progress through the game. You can focus on fighting enemies and improving your gear to fight various bosses, and/or you can focus on building your house and buildings and making things look pretty. Terraria has something for everyone. The combination of survival, fighting, exploration, and building aspects is satisfying (and I'm someone who usually plays shooter games). So I believe that you can find something in Terraria for you.Building:When Re-Logic added half blocks and slanted blocks to Terraria in 1.2, the building got so much more interesting and versatile. There are so many different types of blocks in this game with their own unique textures and styles, and with paint there are even more possibilities. So many creations made in this game are incredibly good.Difficulty:Overall, Terraria with a Classic (AKA Softcore) character and Classic (AKA Normal Mode) world is not that hard, but just be aware that no matter what, you’ll probably die a lot as a beginner. If you like a challenge, however, Expert Mode is the way to go (plus you get extra advantages, such as exclusive accessories, for having an increased difficulty). Even more difficult is Master Mode, giving you more loot than Expert Mode. And if you want the game to be especially difficult, you could create a Mediumcore character (drop all items on death), Hardcore character (permadeath), or use a world seed such as For the worthy. There is also Journey Mode, which is an adjustable difficulty semi-creative mode that requires a Journey exclusive character (can’t go to Classic, Expert Mode, or Master Mode worlds). Personally, I think playing a Classic character in Expert Mode is the most fun way to play.Music:Terraria’s music is great. All of it fits with the style of the game. Almost every biome has a unique song to fit with the theme, and there are different songs for bosses and events as well. I bought the official soundtrack and I love to listen to it whenever I want some background music.Multiplayer:Multiplayer is incredibly easy to set up. The easiest way to play is to join/host through Steam. You can also enter an IP address, which, before 1.3, used to be the only way to play multiplayer at all, but now it's so much easier with Steam integration.Connection is rarely a problem for me, although I think I’ve found that the host has worse lag than the other players, when there is lag that is.Terraria is very fun to play with friends and even with strangers. There are teaming options, PVP, and other multiplayer elements built into the game. Bosses are often much easier to beat in multiplayer as well, because usually if one player dies, the other player(s) can continue to fight the boss and stay alive long enough to let the first player respawn.Performance:Terraria runs very well. On my gaming PC, the game runs perfectly on max settings and has nearly instantaneous loading speeds. On my over a decade old Toshiba laptop, the game runs very nicely on low settings, with only minor loading times.There are several video settings that can be modified to help performance. I would recommend at least turning the background and effects off for lower-end computers.Price:Terraria is very inexpensive. It’s one of the few games I’ve bought at full price and found it completely worth it.Struggles:Terraria has a learning curve. There are many things left up to you to figure out from the start. The Guide NPC is there to give some help. Many things, however, are left up to the player to figure out, much of which is just learned through time and experience. I would recommend looking up tips, tricks, and other information online, such as on the Official Terraria Wiki, or watch videos, like those of ChippyGaming and Edward on YouTube. Personally, I enjoy the learning curve, and the struggle to learn new things is just the right amount to be enjoyable and not annoying.To get to the endgame of Terraria, it does take a while. There is so much content and so many bosses in just vanilla Terraria, that it can be overwhelming, and progression can sometimes feel slow. You may want to rush things like bosses, but you have to prepare well for bosses, or else you’ll probably die. I used to ragequit when I couldn’t beat bosses, and I still get frustrated if I can’t beat a boss. Once you defeat bosses, however, it feels so worth it. And you don’t have to follow an exactly linear path either. Also, you don’t have to play for 30+ hours for a full playthrough just to feel accomplished. From one to a million hours, this game is fun for any length of time.My biggest struggle with this game is the grind for certain items. Some items are extremely hard to get, due to low drop rates or pretty extreme circumstances. There are many items with a drop chance lower than 1%. Realistically, you won’t get every item in the game, if that’s what you’re aiming for. I once wanted to get every enemy banner in the game (you have to kill 50 of the same enemy to get a banner) legitimately, but I gave up on that idea because of how grindy it is to kill 50 of each enemy for the rarest ones (that darn Nymph Banner). To put it simply, it’s possible to get every item in the game, but it’s just not worth it. You should, however, build farms for certain items. But the point is, just get the items in the game that you really want to get legitimately, and it’ll be worth it (if you did want every single item in the game, you can use inventory editors or go to free item servers, but it’s not fun to abuse these).Tips:* Organize and name chests ASAP* Place rope down a Hellevator* Coral Torches are waterproof and Cursed/Ichor Torches (craftable in Hardmode) are liquidproof, making them ideal for being placed on bridges and Hellevators* The Smart Cursor, toggled on or off using Left Ctrl by default, is extremely useful for digging straight tunnels, building structures such as bridges, removing large areas of walls, and other functions. However, don't forget to toggle it off when you're not using it since things can go out of control* Look up how to maintain world purity, since the Corruption, Crimson, and Hallow biomes spread across the world, and the Corruption/Crimson can infect the Jungle biome over time* Go fishing. It’s worth it. Fishing gives you so many tools, accessories, and other loot that enhance the game tremendously. Once you find the Angler NPC in the Ocean biome at either end of the world, use him to get quests to find a specific fish, which you can redeem for loot* For making potions, use an Alchemy Table from the Dungeon to have a 1 in 3 chance to not consume potion ingredients* Use Invisibility Potions while farming for Truffle Worms* Use Warmth Potions while fighting cold/ice-themed enemies (Deerclops, Frost Moon, etc.)Conclusion:I've played this game for over a decade now. I made a Steam account for this game, and I've played through so much of the game's development back when there wasn't even a fraction of the number of items in the game. To put it simply, Terraria is my favorite game. So after well over a thousand hours of playtime, I can safely say that I 100% recommend buying and playing Terraria.;5 May, 2020;

I had originally started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that, I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave the way for those friendships to evolve further. Then we get to the release of the 1.3 update in the summer of 2015. I absolutely lost my sh*t for this update. For months my friends and I planned to play through the game again and spend time exploring all the new content. That was my first character that ever surpassed 100 hours of playtime. After that initial playthrough with my friends, I would periodically revisit the game on my own and with my friends for years. Sometimes there would be mods, sometimes it would be the original experience. Regardless of how I played, I never ever got bored with the game. I may only have 1600 hours across 6 years, but each one of those hours was spent in the game having a blast and completing my saves for each character I played on. With the Journeys end update coming out earlier this year, an update I have played through and through, I have finally managed to scrounge up the courage to say goodbye to this game. That doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing it, that will never be a feasible option to me, especially with a game that has shaped my childhood. This review serves as a ode to an amazing game that has changed my life, as well as a way for me to cope with the game no longer receiving updates.I will forever thank the wonderful company of Re-Logic for an amazing product and the community that has surrounded the game for sharing such a novel game with me. Goodbye Re-Logic, and I look forward to future endeavors. Sincerely,Katie Dixon AKA KittoMen;21 December, 2020;

Terraria;Azaros;NOT INFORMED;660 people found this review helpful27 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,063.4 hrs on record;So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria: - This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements- It has an incredible amount of content to it- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! - Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!- I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTINGCons? Hmm.- Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!- Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. Other thought: - If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. I spent $10 on this.;24 December, 2018;

Oh yeah.Game of the year for everyone else? Maybe!Let me tell you some things about this game:+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area ""The City of Tears"" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressiveMy real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.Fot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!";11 June, 2017;

I have 300+ hours* on this game.That being said, I played through about 250 of those hours, and I can confidently say that this is, and might always be, my favorite game.I'll start with the cons:- There is a LOT of roaming around and exploration in this game. Although this can appeal to some people, it can definitely make you feel lost and a little frustrated trying to find out where to go (especially after Greenpath, at least for me).- Many, many points in the game where you'll get stuck for literal hours trying to get past. If you tilt easily or are an ardent completionist, you might have a bad time. You will probably never get to the Land of Storms.- Sometimes, the movement mechanics can feel really unfair, especially at the most difficult platforming sections (WHY DOES MONARCH WINGS SEND YOU DOWN FIRST!?), although I think learning and mastering the mechanics is all just part of the game.- Although I've never played Dark Souls (I'll get to it eventually), I've heard that this game's story feels very similar. Not sure how this is a con, but felt that it was important to mention.- Will destroy your Mac's battery. Seriously.Now time for the pros. I'll admit I'm a little biased, but I think there's a reason this is my favorite game.First of all, this game is massive. My first 112% of this game took me a little under 100 hours, if not actually 100 hours. Now, every other playthrough of this game that I've done took me significantly less time, but considering that this game was made by a team of three people and that this game is a quarter the price of Dark Souls, I'd say that the amount of content in this game is remarkable. And that content isn't filler content. Few rooms in this game are. Almost every room will have something new in it, either a new enemy, a new mechanic/upgrade, a piece of the story, or a secret. Since its initial release, three free content packs have come out, along with one ""major update,"" with a paid DLC coming in 2019**. Every one of the content packs released so far has had so much new content, including some of the most difficult bosses in the game. Hidden Dreams came out with bosses that, if beaten enough, can kill you with a single blow. The Grimm Troupe arrived with a dream variant on a new, already-difficult boss that took me over three hours of attempts to beat, along with the hardest platforming that you might ever come across.

Black Desert;Scrumpy;NOT INFORMED;7,468 people found this review helpful154 people found this review funny; Recommended 285.4 hrs on record;"So, where to even begin. I guess the most important thing here is that this is certainly not the MMO for everybody. This MMO manages to pack in something for every kind of player out there, but that actually doesn't mean it will appeal to everyone. First of all, I'll cover the topic of the pricepoint, since in the very most lenient sense here, it's ""variable"". It's $10 to get into the game. No monthly fees, nothing. That's pretty handy. The price point is at least low enough that for most people, even if they don't like the game, they won't have lost out on much. Now, chances are, the price point is that low because THERE ARE MICROTRANSACTIONS, IF YOU WANT THEM. I'm putting this at the beginning of the review because I know that this will either immediately deter people, or encourage them to hear me out on this. The best way I saw these described was as ""conveniences"". You can get items that rival the cash shop items, but it will take time, and it will take effort. But, there is nothing to stop someone from simply getting a headstart on the game by dropping a little extra money on the game. Is that bad? Well, at a $10 initial price point, I don't think so, because almost all of the cash shop items are convenience items, i.e. streamlining workers, getting a nicer boat without investing time into it, getting gear to speed up fishing initially, etc. The game counteracts this by allowing a lot of things to be completed AFK, such as fishing, or even autolooping a running path to level up your stamina (seriously, you can just have your character run infinitely between two points and get levels out of it, I can't make this up). Need to level your mount? Check the ""auto feed"" option, stock up on carrots, set an autoloop, and go sleep or do productive things while your character travels between points A and B and your horse learns new skills. So honestly, the cash shop items are certainly a thing which most people would look down on, but I haven't even seen the need for them. That said, I could have higher tolerance for grinding (see my Maplestory hours, let's not talk about it).Now, on the topic of grinding, this IS a korean MMO, and it's gonna involve a lot of grinding. The AFK system is honestly a god-send, I'm telling you. However, the combat is very dynamic and frankly the best I've ever seen in an MMO (it does seem very similar to TERA, but definitely more rewarding and satisfying). For skills grinding, a fair amount of it can be done while tabbed out, so the grindy feeling there is alleviated to a fair extent. As far as skills versus combat, this game does a very good job of letting you choose your own playstyle. Want to make it to the second town and then level all the way to 55+ and make millions by fishing? Sure, go ahead. Want to immediately start a farm and create a monopoly on food goods in the player marketplace? That works too. Set up trade routes between nodes and make all your money and experience through buying low and selling high, it doesn't matter, you get rewarded with level exp for so many things in this game, you can choose how you want to play the game. You can even treat it almost as a single-player game with the Black Spirit quest line, so play how you want to. And hey, if you're still into the kill-quest style MMO, that's all here for you too, and you won't even have to touch the other skills. It's relieving to play an MMO that lets you decide how you want to play it. Something I have not been a part of yet is the guild system, which entails warring over territories or capturing areas to claim tax to pay guild members and such. I don't know too much about this, but from what I've viewed, it seems incredible to wage all-out-war with other guilds for essentially control over money. The PvP seems to be a big part of this game, and I'm hoping to make it to that end-game experience soon. And yes, before you ask, these wars DO entail forts, cannons, armies, etc, which just seems super awesome. Other guilds though seem to take the game casually, and only want a community to play with, so that's diversified as well.Now for the more technical stuff. The graphics are gorgeous, the combat is fluid and feels OH SO GOOD, and the AFK feature is even enhanced by an option to minimize the game to the tray. The chat is very spammy with system notifications when you first join the game, but the settings menus help with all that and it should take you just a couple trial-and-errors to figure out what you do want to see broadcast and what you don't want to see. The quest handling is nice and will even autopath you to destinations, and despite minor environmental hookups (I got stuck on a staircase once) it's a very reliable system and can streamline the early game.Now, so after all of this, why can't I recommend it to everyone? I mean, I'm giving it a thumbs up, am I not? Well, it's because there is very little explained to you in this game, and that's probably because if they did, you wouldn't ever end the tutorial. The game has so much complexity to it that you're going to want to have YouTube open, whatever databases or guides you can find, a friend on skype, really anything to help you understand a new part of the game you've decided to dabble in. For some, that's incredibly daunting and I can't say everyone would enjoy the game based on this aspect. And this isn't me saying ""GO BACK TO YOUR BABY MMOS YA BABIES"" I mean seriously, this game is a lot to take in and I'm surprised even I can handle it. While I believe you can take the game in any way you like, you still might get curious one day and find a whole new aspect to the game that doesn't suit your fancy, or it's just so horrifically complicated at first that you aren't going to understand it until your 15th fail stack. Now personally, I don't mind having to research an aspect of a game, and I even personally have a journal where I jot down notes for all sorts of games I play (I'm a huge nerd, I know this). But some people want to hop in and just play to end-game, which is okay. Having to find and research your way to the end-game isn't always fun, and I understand that. So with all of that said, my final verdict is this: if any of this sounded appealing to you, give it a shot. Given that it casts it's net very wide, you can probably find something you'd enjoy in this game. But, be prepared to do some research, as some of the time you're just going to be confused, no matter how much experience you have with MMOs or in-game economies. If the mention of a cash shop that DOES benefit players deterred you entirely, then, ah well, that's fair, and I'd even encourage you to look elsewhere. Despite it being solely convenience items, I can't dispute the fact that they do exactly that. And finally, if all of this sounded appealing to you, I almost plead with you to play this, as I ended up finding the MMO I was looking for, and I hope you do to.Thanks!-ScrumpyEdit: Wow! Thanks for all the reception everybody. Glad to see this review is helping people. After discussing the game with a prospective buyer, I realized I totally forgot to mention that the Black Desert Online site DOES ALLOW A 7-DAY TRIAL. Please note, the account used for that trial and the account used in Steam CANNOT BE LINKED, but this is a way for you to try the game and see if you like it! If the $10 or the cash shop is concerning, give the trial a chance and see, and then decide what medium you would want to purchase it on. I'd recommend using the trial and then coming to steam to start anew and know what direction you want to pursue, but please keep this in mind! Hope this helps!";17 June, 2017;

What's not to recommend?Here's the thing. This game is a beautiful exercise in game design. Virtually everything, from the economy through to the relative silver rates for crafting, grinding, and everything except hunting, is mathematically-balanced to a genius level degree. The world, quests, and classes have an amazing degree of depth.The reason I don't recommend? The exploitation of your psychology is also perfectly designed. From the first time you get ganked and swear to yourself 'I'll get my revenge once I gear up', through to the constant shower of micro-rewards. need to login 24/7. gambling-based enhancement. and exponential sunk-cost, this is a game designed to exploit your every weakness to take out your credit card.It's not a bad experience subjectively. a lab rat will always look forward to it's next morsel as it runs through the maze. But it is a ruthless exemplar of how to manipulate players. A bit like I'd say drugs are probably fun but I wouldn't recommend them, I think the same applies to this game.

Also you can drop all your idea's of your perfect E-Girl in the character design. When the game just came out it was mostly grinding for a long amount of hours. For a regular player it took around 20 to 40 hours of playtime to get to lvl 50. Now the game has turned into a fresh start friendly game where you get to lvl 50 in just 1 hour of grinding. The game also gives new players tons of stuff to help you to get further into the game. This is not just a MMORPG. It's a Korean MMORPG. This means you will have to grind a ???? ton to be able to do anything besides the things i listed above here. PVP wont be possible if you dont put any time into the game.Now to the beautiful fail stack system. This is BS RNG based but keeps the game fun if you don't have a temper. The game can make you super frustrated but when you manage to reach your goal you will have a feeling of accomplishment. IF RNG IS NOT YOUR THING DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!When you read this you probably see comments about that the game is Pay to Win. This is BS. The game gives you tons of free stuff and it's easy to get the stuff you want by playing without spending money. But here is a big BUTT. If you want to lvl faster and get more money out of the time that you are grinding spending IRL money on pets/outfits could be an option.The game end game is 100% focused on PVP. There are sometimes PVE events tho. This game is for the people that have a feeling that they need something to put a lot of time in. This is the solution for you.

Enemies are different from your regular MMO.- The combat system is extremely complexed. You ""can"" hotbar buttons, however you're handicapping yourself if you don't press them in real actions like Up+F. It's much more fluid if you press action combinations for combos. What makes this the combat different than the others is move canceling. I didn't know this was in this game until I saw another player performing impossible moves.- The grind actually feels good because you're performing attacks that are beyond that of rinse and repeat. You even feel like an absolute god.- lots of jobs: crafting, fishing, tanning, etc. You can get lost in them for hours, and there's also a ranking system on it, which is weird but good if you like that kick back experience.neutral:- Gender lock, however some classes are just like the other such as Wizard and Witch or Musa and Maehwa.- confusing minigames and small tutorial in the beginning that won't teach you anymore after the first 10 lvls.- No fast travel, just your feet or your mount. The mount is an actual being too. Enemies can attack it seperately and kill it.Cons:- No endgame anything. Gears is by daily/weekly miniboss challenges in a particular location, which will take you 5-10 minutes on mount.- No dungeon runs either. Match making isn't in this game. You want to party with people, you do it the old fashion way: by guild or shouting.- RNG everything. However, this can be fixed with +luck gear. Luck will help increase particular chances but RNG rules most of everything whether farming, damage from particular anything, drops and stats on gear doing particular things.- A turn-off to newcomers that don't like hard MMOs. The learning curve for this game is pretty high, but if you like a challenge it's rewarding. Those that like just pressing hotbar commands are the first to suffer after reaching lvl 50.-A Majority of quests (if not life skills) are fetch and kill. Talk to NPC, go kill 30+ enemies, come back. This is what you call a Korean Grinder MMO.Pay extra portion:There are key things that make microtransactions somewhat enticing: Pets, value packs, extra inventory and weight limit expansion. Although you can play this game ""pay once"" like it was intended to be played, however these items make the game much easier PvE. As for PvP, there's nothing that can one up another player PvP other than better gear. Better gear is bought with silver and silver is power. In order to get this sort of silver, there are many ways, and what makes getting silver extremely easier are these items I've listed for microtransactions.1) Pets w/a max of 4 can pick up items for you and carry on their own. This alleviates some of the stress of picking up items from mobs. Each pet is roughly $8 real money, but if you play the game long enough, 20 days gets you a free penguin (at least for the time being). At lower levels, pets aren't something you'll consider, however in higher levels while you're in a party you'll have that one player with pets, and that player will take everything that's dropped.2) value packs: you can buy a 30 day value pack for $15, which is basically their version of subscription fee. This can be bought in auction houses with ingame currency, however it's quite hard to get one as it's the highest sought out item in the market and they only release 1-2 every 10-15 minutes. The value pack increase 100 weight limite, 16 inventory slots and 16 storage, and on top of that you get %30 back for auction house sales. What does that mean for sales? W/o it you're typically selling everything for roughtly 60%. That 300k stone sold will only give you back 180k unless you have the value pack in which you'll get back 210k. This actually adds up as you will be selling millions of items in the auction house and a majority of your income is by this.3) inventory space. In-game there are quests that can increase your inventory space up to 30, or you can pay a premium and increase it even further to around 90, which a lot of life skillers do. If you want to carry a ton of different items, it's almost needed for you to carry so many things at once.4) weight limit increase. You can grind to increase the strength of your character to carry heavier items, or you can have particular items that already increase your weight limit like the value pack or hercules gear that increase you 150+ weight. However, in higher levels there is gear that is far superior that you'll want to equip, so increasing your strength to carry is something that is either grinded or bought with microtransactions.There are other items that I didn't list, but that's because they're a want vs need. These 4 that I've listed a borderline ""need"". All-in-all you can potentially play this game completely ""pay-once"" as it is intended whether being $6-10, but you will be extremely tempted to purchase one of the 4 items in order to make your life a bit easier in-game. One of the things you'll probably consider is the value pack as it is basically a subscription fee for WoW or FFXIV. Don't let that mentality of trading one MMO for another for its subscription fee sway your wallet. You should only buy this pack if you really do want to invest your time and real money into this game as BDO is multiple games in one. BDO with the core of a MMORPG has many elements that make it multiple games. These other games are called life skils.1) Fishing: sure, you can fish in any mmo, but can you build a ship go to another island or in the middle of nowhere and fish there? With whatever you've caught you have options of cooking or finding a trader to buy your fish, which becomes an actual job that many players have come to enjoy called AFK fishing.2) trade empire: I'm new to this concept but you can potentially connect areas through trade routes, process or build trade crates and have them shipped to another area to sell for a profit. You can have works around the world collect and bring back to your storage items in order to process or built crates to trade again making it a trade empire in which you can also haggle prices for these items in a different area.3) Cooking/alchemy: the most effecient way to cook/alchemy and make money is by having contract NPC workers find resources, bring it back to your storage units in each town where you can make the necessary food or potions and then sell them on the market.Again, the 4 microtransactions are borderline needs and they're more purpose for those that are serious about this game and for specific situations. Grinders: pets. traders/fishers: inventory space and weight limit. and alchemy/cooking: value pack. Although you can give your character all of them to make your character more well rounded, they're not much of a need as comparison to these particular key points. I hope this helps, and if you want to know more, leave a comment.TL.DRIs this game worth your time? Yes, because other mmos are really old and out of date. Top subscription IMO is FFXIV vs WoW. Top free to play mmo is Star Wars, however it's only up to lvl 50 free. Best pay once: this game followed by Guild wars 2 and then ESO.What about p2w? It's significant. Since you're paying once, and if you played any mmo, you most likely put money into the game that was more than just subsciption or just the base of the game. If there's a game you really care about, you'd support it by buying something whether cosmetic or actually helpful. For the price they're asking for is pretty cheap. You have a choice whether or not to put more into it. If you get sucked into this game like I have, believe me, this is one game you won't regret. This game sets a standards of graphics and combat that newer mmos should have. I'd hate to have the next best mmo come with runescape graphics or Maple story 2-D feel.";13 June, 2022;
Black Desert;Wanderer;NOT INFORMED;385 people found this review helpful13 people found this review funny; Recommended 12,343.0 hrs on record;I have 10k hours so that's a thing...The game is a korean grinder with a somewhat aggressive cash shop, so depends if you know your limits or not.Absolutely has pay2win items available in the cash shop, meaning time savers and convenience items. A few items such the tent are only available in the cashhop. The tent is for fixing gear, buffs and selling loot and is considered a vital item. Most items can be acquired from grinding or events but that is irrelevant as they can be bought with Real life cash. That being said the game never lies about what it is. Its all laid out in the cash shop, in game, about what you can buy.Game is not a theme park mmo, so as soon as you are done with the tutorial story you need to decide what you want to do, this is a problem for some since they need to be led about.This game is a completely open world mmo so you can actually pick a direction and go there, you don't need to finish all the story to unlock different areas of the map, although you may get walloped :DFollowing the black spirit quest line as a new player is the best idea, with a season character.However there is an overwhelming amount of stuff to do and grind for, as the veterans always say BDO is a marathon not a sprint.The main thing that first attracted me to BDO was the horse training which is surprisingly complicated, the horse animations and skills are very satisfying to use. The mounts also don't spawn out of your characters butt like in most games, when you dismount they are still there in the world, which I think is wonderfully immersive. There is also all the other usual lifeskills such as gathering, farming, cooking, alchemy, sailing, fishing, hunting, trading and bartering.Gaming the economy is not really a thing in this game since max and min price of things is managed by the developers, there is also no player trading so don't expect it to be like EVE or ARCHEAGE in this respect.BDO also has a good housing system, with lots of choice of house locations. For convenience, roleplay or simple looks and lots of choice when it comes to furniture items. Also there is no large initial cost or lack of housing or loading screens to get to your house. No loss of said house/houses when you have a break from the game, everything is how you left it when you return.Almost all the cash shop furniture can now be crafted for free now, which is amazing.The action combat is first rate, I think of all the mmos I have played only TERA has better combat, BDO's mob grinding is better though. Which is just as well since grinding mobs is a huge part of the game and can be a decider as to whether you will like the game or not. (nothing like putting on some music and killing thousands of critters)This game doesn't do dungeons like most mmos do, it has only 3 which are parts of the same dungeon.Visually they are lovely but I think mechanically they are clunky and the reliance on having to use guides is a problem.If you have played WOW, Final fantasy or Destiny 2 you will find these raids disappointing in comparison.BDO has never been known for its story and it still isn't, some of the newest story content is fully voiced and is quite good, however unfortunately some of the earliest story/tutorial is a real slog.Also the quality of life in this game is through the roof, every option you can think of for turning stuff off or on, or adjusting UI. Search bars for items/npcs and all items have a proper description and will have a auto path to the npc they need to go to, on a right click.The autopathing is a pleasure, the knowledge system is great and contributes to your entire account. All of your alts have access to almost everything on your account. storage/mounts/pets/guild, its just one big Family, which is very convenient.Gearing is actually way easier than it was when I started playing in 2017. with the season servers, its almost obscene how much easier it is now, with benefits new and old players alike, a very good change. The upgrading of gear and the system of doing it are pretty complicated and much complained about but the season servers really do act as a great tutorial for how to works and if you'd prefer to just avoid it and just grind and buy what you want from the marketplace.Cosmetics are some of the best and most detailed in any mmo however the best of them are in the cashshop, so be aware of that if it bothers you. The game is very cheap to buy or often free to try with no subscription requirement. There are regular giveaways of cosmetic armours and things from the cashshop, also ones you can get with a loyalty system, if you can be patient.The dye system is extremely good and has many slots to achieve that specific look and is one of the main reasons its nice to have the optional subscription. The value pack.If you are going to play the value pack is definitely worth having and has a lot of convenience. However the game has no required subscription, so you can just login whenever you feel like it.The character creation is still one of the best in any mmo or even more modern games, which is kinda crazy and you can completely change your characters face or hair if you get sick of it, provided you have the value pack.The game does have gender locked classes but normally there is a opposite equivalent, each one having its own small class quest line.BDO is probably the best most complete open world/seamless mmo on the market, only New world looks better graphically.The areas of the map look like they fit together naturally like they would in real life, some of the cities are actually modelled off real cities.One thing I like is there is a distinct style as well, they don't try to do everything. horses are the primary mount, very little fast travel. so mounts are actually useful, and no true flying mounts either just gliding. The amount of crazy MMO stuff isn't outrageous either, no crazy mounts. flying cars/robots/giraffe monstrosities or ridiculous outfits like final fantasy/Tera. just some usual mmo suspects, battle lingerie being the main culprit, which i'm not opposed to .)BDO is one of those games either you love it or hate it---------------------------------------------------------------Honestly not a fan of some the newest changes, like seasonal characters always being available ie not being season characters anymore. There was something nice about the excitement of a new season, people returning to the game after a break, playing and levelling up.Also too much casualisation of the game, stop giving stuff away. The whole point of mmos is to work towards something, It wasn't a handout like most mmos are.I liked this mmo because it meant something to have the special mount/thing or to have certain gear.But i had a good time, so it is what it is.;23 December, 2022;

The game itself is an amazing game but Iron Galaxy really take a ???? on this game. Naughty Dog, if you care about your fans and one of your biggest games ever, you would fire Iron Galaxy and fix this port yourselves, because this is truly disgraceful.I am 10hrs into the game at the time of writing this review to make sure it was just as bad as everyone is saying it is. It.s worse than I thought. I have had a total of 7 crashes, one of which required a full PC restart. The game somehow deleted my graphics driver from my computer causing me to have to spend an hour or two figuring out how to manually redownload it and the game changes my sensitivity back to default every time I open the game. (Btw 10hrs in and ive only just reached the Hotel because building shaders took about an hour and a few times it wasnt responding and I had to wait.)I cannot say this loud enough. ***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET*** Iron Galaxy took a massive ???? on my favorite title and it should not be allowed to stay like this.

AGAIN, but now I´m finally able to play it... or am I?Well release wasnt that pleasant but heres a short Rundown on how its state for me was on release, and how it is now.For my Specs I´m running a Ryzen 5 2600 with 16 Gb of Ram, for the Gpu I´m having a RX5700XT (and yes its being bottlenecked by the Cpu) and im playing on a Full HD Monitor with only 60 hz cause my 144hz Monitor broke recently.I also have FSR 2.0 activated on the ""Quality"" Setting.Okay lets get started:Release: The game was literally unplayable for me. Besides the extremely Long Shader Cache installation the game itself was horrible and in an absolute unacceptable state.I had LOADING WINDOWS MID GAME. Even the Ps3 didnt have this (and yes I know the game is specifically coded for the ps3 and other Console Plattforms) but why did they decide to let the Worst Porting studio in the History of PC-Porting handle the biggest Trademark of their company. Well i had the game on all settings, Strict and Mixed (sometimes it didnt even care what my settings were and loaded low poly models instead) and it was just unplayable in every way so i decided to wait.Patch 1.0.1.5: I mean... it fixed some stuff?I still resorted to the widelyspread Oodle fix wich did increase my performance a bit and made it ""playable"" but not enjoyable. Still I managed to play for couple of hours wihtout wanting to rethink my choices in life.Patch 1.0.2.0: Okay now we´re talking.There are some major improvements for stability and performance in general.Also they fixed the high Vram usage which was just a display error.It wasnt displaying the right amount of vram usage when changing graphic settings.Also it reduced the overall Cpu usage which is always nice.Patch 1.0.2.1: Wonderful.They fixed an Issue where you had massive camera jitter which was just unbearable.Small Patch but definitely an Improvement.At this point I´m also halfway through the Game.Patch 1.0.3.0: What happened???This patch focused on mostly audio based issues and various issues across the board but it somehow managed to kinda tank the performance a bit. At this point im almost done with the game but I noticed that my ram was filling to the brim and suddenly dumps everything leaving my cpu to be overloade and my storage doing nothing,This causes my game to be left at about 30-40 fps for couple of minutes until my ram has been build up again.Patch 1.0.4.0: WOW.I finished the game before the Patch released but I´m playing my NG+ save on this patch and ist awesome.Finally something with not only Major improvements, I´d say they´re Gigantic Improvements.-More Graphic Settings-Optimized CPU and GPU Usage-Much better Performance-More acceptable Loading Times (Still faster then GTA V)-Better Texture Streaming across the Board-And a much more fluent ExperienceAll the annoying issues at the beginning were gone or mostly fixed.There are still some major issues, such as the definite memory leak that is happening and I´m pretty sure they can get it much more optimized, but overall the game is moving in a playable and enjoyable state...which is exactly what it should because i think TLOU is an experience everyone should take the chance to have this experience. And without ad oubt, this remke of the game IS the definitive edition.Still as a long time fan since the beginning, I´m more then dissapointed in what stae the long awaited PC-Port arrived and i hope for Naughty Dog that the can make this Port to state that its meant to be played, because as it is, it is disrespecting towards themselves, their whole Fanbase (which isnt a small one) and the story that is being told inside the Game.And thats that.Edit: Patch 1.0.5 has been released a couple of hours ago. Ill try to play it as soon as the 50gb update has finished.Its focusing on every major issue so im excited to see for myself how it played out.Also I know there are a lot of grammar issues in my review so far, but i aint gonna fix them, so go ahead, sue me.Alright the Patch did fix a lot of stuff but theres something weird about it.At this point im now able to play the game on Medium-High Settings without FSR Upscaling, and im reaching around 50-60 fps much more stable.It aint perfect, but its more then playable, its almost enjoyable.They also fixed the overloading ram issue that set my ram back for about 2-4 gb in space which is a lot.There are more graphic settings, better resource utilization etc. but there is no real performance bump...Yes the game runs much more stable and the frametimes are much tighter then before, but real preformance improvements in terms of raw fps, there is no significant difference, but I feel like this is the first version that should have gone to retail.(Edit 30.05 Patch 1.0.5.1)This patch does focus on stability improvements, even though I did not notice any real performance difference, I did notice a much faster boot and loading time then before. (This may vary tho)Not much else then that but better then nothing :)I´ll be keeping on updating until this game is in an almost perfect state.Guess who´s back? Well that´d be me.And I got some news.I´ve noticed that there was a lot more fuss about TLOU since the release of the Part 2 Remaster on the PS5. There are a lot of speculations that it might release on to the PC aswell and that might spark some fellow gamers to play the first part, especially because it is much cheaper to get now.But the question is... is it really fixed?Because i went through the reviews of the game and some people are still suffering from crashes, stuttering and other, more weird problems. (Btw, dont even bother checking out Naughty Dogs ""Known Issues"" page, they didnt update it in a long time and there are still notes referring to old and fixed problems)The game overall was playable the last time I played it, but maybe all this optimisation led to... lets say, complicated issues.Right now ill be checking out the newest version which is v.1.1.2 on the 7th of february.Im still using the same specs for reference at 1080p 60hz.I am also running on the latest Radeon Drivers (24.1.1) with Anti-Lag and Enhanced Sync Enabled. (Anti-Lag for the best Frametimes possible and Enhanced Sync, cause in my opinion its better then normal V-Sync and its open-source sooo...)Im playing on custom settings, balancing my cpu and gpu usage around the medium to high settings. Shader cache building took me over 35 minutes but thats still faster then the 2 hours at launch, still not acceptable, and the game ran at around 55-60 fps with FSR disabled.Enabling it doesnt make a big difference so ill leave it off.But its playable it feels a bit smoother then the last time and i didnt notice anything off tbh.So all the haters that say the game isnt optimized yet, well it isnt, but it was worse and now its playable, but you still need a good pc.The game is very Cpu intensive and a good gpu doesnt hurt in that case, so if you want to play the game on its max settings, you need a pc that can handle it.So thats it for my update on this, enjoy the game, love you and see you if Part 2 releases(Had to shorten the review, it got too long :))";26 April, 2023;

And the other people review bombing were complaining they didn't have servers in their region, when they actually did, the game just falsely reported not having it (The game didn't show Oceania servers, but Oceania servers were in the game and people were playing on them already).;10 December, 2023;

Monster Hunter Stories;Shiverwar;NOT INFORMED;17 people found this review helpful; Recommended 4.7 hrs on record;Despite my time on the Steam version, I played the heck outta this on the 3DS, and let me tell you, it is a great experience. I was very skeptical at first when I saw my girlfriend playing it, but later on I found a copy at Walmart for... I think $15? I found out pretty quickly why she liked it, because this game charmed me proper. You have many of the monsters people love (and some that people don't), a vibrant world filled with color and life, a great soundtrack that lends to the atmosphere of the game, and simple mechanics that never overstay their welcome. After playing Stories 2 and seeing what it had to offer (great game as well, by the way, you should totally check it out), I just HAD to come back to where it all began. The Gene system in this game is by far the standout feature, what with many ways to customize your Monsties and even change their elemental affinities, such as having a dragon element Silver Rathalos (like I had in the 3DS version). This re-release may not have the 3rd-party collaboration content, like the Zelda collab, but what it does have is the content that was missing from the US release of Stories. Rajang, Teostra, and Kushala Daora are all here, and available as Monsties to collect! I sound like I'm trying to sell you guys the game, don't I? I can't help it, though. It's just such a great title, and a worthwhile addition to the Monster Hunter franchise. Navirou's English voice still grates on me, but everything else is in tip-top shape with this remaster, and for just $30? Seriously, if ever you were considering trying Stories out, this really is the perfect time and the perfect place to start.; 14 June;

Farming Simulator 22;SergNMerp;81 products in account;252 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 628.8 hrs on record;Updated 10/13/23(Summary at bottom)NOT a reskinned FS19. I have about 650 hours on FS19 and I can most certainly say this is much better in many ways, and many things have been completely overhauled. - Sounds have had a major overhaul, makes the game feel more realistic and immersive.- A few minor realism additions, like visual gear-shifting, cab suspension, etc.- More placeables than ever, including sheds with working doors, refuel stations, seed & fert tanks, etc. Fences, lights, and other decor too, to brighten up your farm a bit.- Many new brands, and more tire brand options. Also license plates for equipment and vehicles.- Character customization. Imo, not the best, graphics and general proportions look weird, but hey, better than before.- Better organized XML files. Much more easier on the eyes compared to FS17, and easier to find things such as the money value. I don't need to use ctrl+f anymore, I can just scroll. (Speaking of XML editing, instead of editing the careerSavegame.xml file like FS17 & FS19 to edit your cash, here you need to edit farms.xml file instead in the same folder, careerSavegame.xml is only for appearance in the main menu.)- Better organized shop UI, not to mention the UI overall. Imo, the weird blue fade on the speedometer/tachometer reminds me of those old games, and I wish they had just instead updated the FS19 one.- An actual American-based map. Major improvement from Ravenport and Goldcrest Valley, feels more of the true american countryside thanks to that new office here in the U.S. that Giants got a while ago.- Buying used equipment. Great for starting a farm on a tight budget, and in multiplayer you can buy other farm's sold vehicles. Wish there was more than 5 at a time though.- Vehicle gearbox. Not required if you don't want to use it, but I like it. A wee bit confusing at times however, I'm used to the way you shift in American Truck Simulator, but this is different. Not bad, maybe needs to be tweaked a bit. Will note that it's sometimes buggy, especially with mods.- Obviously graphics, you won't really notice a huge jump between FS19 and FS22 as the major jump of the franchise was between FS17 and FS19, but there are some noticeable changes. Also, 3D tracks on tractors. No more jpeg tracks.- Seasons. I don't like playing so realistic to the point I have to wait time for the proper planting and harvesting time, but there's an option to make it so the seasons are just visual only. - Multiplayer Voice Chat, very useful.Now, there are of course many bugs with the game, and some features missing since it got released not too long ago. Some rather aggravating bugs/missing features are:- Landscaping, a tad bit annoying with the camera and movement. There's no snapping things to a certain rotation, and the camera angle is from a bird's eye view that swoops down instead of zooming in, which is rather annoying when trying to line things up together. There's also no sprinting like in FS17 (idk about the others)- AI workers. We all know from previous FS games that the AI is notorious, especially in FS17. Here, there have been some improvements, and with the addition of AI being able to drive vehicles to and fro, that's really useful, but again, very buggy. The classic 'Helper F is blocked by an object!' pops up every now and then, you tab over and there's nothing in it's way. Lately, on modded maps, the AI sometimes will just sit there doing nothing. Possibly just a mod-side issue. - Buildings, most notably the farmhouse. If you look into the windows, it's just a copied .jpeg of a weird looking kitchen with yellow cabinets and a granite looking wall. I'm sure Giants will add in an interior at some point, I don't want jpeg interiors like FS13 & FS17. Also, you cannot interact with/enter any existing buildings/sheds/barns on the farms on the land you purchase. I sure hope that gets changed.(note: kinda sorta fixed? some sheds you can enter)Bugs TL.DR:- Landscaping (Controls & viewing angles are awkward)- AI Driving/Transport (Blocked by nothing, drives the wrong path or drives in circles')- didn't note this but general physics, collisions, and the gearbox still need to be tuned.TL.DR:There are many bugs, I hope they'll be fixed before the next year. But there are also many improvements from previous FS games, as someone who's played FS13 (Xbox 360), 17 (Steam), and 19 (Epic Games).At this time, with the amount of bugs/missing features in the game, you can go ahead and buy it if you want. I managed to snag a deal with the season passes where I got both for like $30, damn good deal, would NOT recommend paying full price for each individual DLC.I have not tested everything, and I have not played every map. I do not have all of the bugs and missing features listed, I will update this review as I come across more notable bugs, missing features, and changes from previous FS games.Again, this is a newly released game, so unless Giants decides to not fix these issues/keep them removed like EA did with Battlefield 2042, then I will change this review as needed.11/24/21 UpdateSo you can use Q & E to switch between the license plate types, yet when you're typing in your custom license plate and you need to press Q or E, it switches the license plate type. They do have an on-screen keyboard I assume for consoles, but I really don't want to *click, move mouse (repeat 8 more times)* every single time I have to put in a license plate. My way to bypass this is make sure the color selection is highlighted when you start typing.The field care addon is nice, more stuff to do with Grain farming. I haven't really played around with that yet.Graphics for working the fields look much better, but when the field state changes (harvested to cultivated, to plowed, etc) is still very noticeable and jittery, a bit annoying as it is ruining the immersion a little.Pallet physics have improved a ton, however, but they do still slide around imo a wee bit too easily.Bigbags! Can easily pick them up with anything with forks, and you can feel that you're picking up a heavy item. They have realistic physics, so that's nice.12/31/21 Update- Pre-Placed Buildings can now be deleted off of farms.- The issue with the semi truck axles acting weird is now fixed. They drive much smoother now.4/12/22 Update:- Character customization is saved to the last customized option.- License Plates are also saved the same way.- Updated/revised entire review9/9/22 Update:Revised entire review again, clarified some things, and removed some stuff that didn't need to be here to make room because of the damn review character limit.10/11/23 Update:Fine tuned the review a little bit, moved a few notable things from previous updates to the main category, blablabla. I don't think I can do much more for this review, especially with the character limit.;22 November, 2021;

I already played other fighting games mostly in single player, because I am a casual who cant really find the courage (or skill) to learn a million complicated combos and characters, so I never played multiplayer for longer than 2 hours. But then I tried this game and found the modern controlls. And while other die hard fans of the game and genre (which I totally respect and adore for their commitment) dont like the feature it is an easy way for casuals like me to get enjoyment from the game. The drive mechanic is also probably the most beginner friendly mechanic I saw in a fighting game yet. So if you are like me and are maybe a bit afraid to play games like this online, give it a go with modern controlls and have fun!

I'm not a GBF fan at all, and was a bit down on the reviews before launch. But the art/animation and what I thought was another entry in my favorite genre (JRPG) motivated me to buy anyway... and this game is simply fun. Fun. Remember fun?Look, the story is as barebones as it gets. Which is a shame, because it's clear there's a lot of quality lore and franchise history to pull from. The sidekick character is utterly awful to listen to. And the game lacks a good amount of PC settings, has limited frame rate support, and zero ultra wide support (though, it is relatively well optimized, I'll give it that).But everything else? It's great. It's got high quality character action and stands toe to toe with Platinum's best. It's got more JRPG elements (gear, leveling, systems, parties, etc.) than the newest Final Fantasy. Its world is beautiful. The music is exceptional. The art and graphics are S-Tier. The world, while relatively linear, feels grand and alive. And the combat and boss battles are incredible. And apparently the end game brings PSO/MH-levels of hunting and grinding. Can't wait!; 4 February;

Granblue Fantasy: Relink;Allane;216 products in account;109 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 116.7 hrs on record;Long story short, do I recommend this game? Yes. But...You need to understand this is not a live-service game. It is entirely linear, and while the second half of the game opens up a bit, it's just an illusion. Once you reach the end of the endgame, that's it. All builds converge into the same place, and once you have your final weapon, there's only one optional mega boss ahead of you. There's nothing left to grind for, no incentives to chase - I hope you enjoyed the ride like I did. If you go the completionist route then you'll have plenty to do, but I can't attest to that personally since I'm not a completionist.That isn't to say there isn't variety available, though: the different characters each have unique playstyles that make them feel powerful and flashy. Every character is viable to the endgame (as of the 1.2.1 update), so pick whomever you like, as you're probably going to have fun with them. You can always transfer your main Sigil build from character to character, as they all require the same Sigils by the endgame.The story itself is average, but the visuals, music (featuring Nobuo Uematsu on some tracks), and gameplay (this was originally a Platinum Games project) are great. The real trouble is running out of things to do, and that's OKAY! Plenty of critically and publicly acclaimed games are a one and done affair, and Relink is no exception, it just takes longer than average. It's okay to feel like you're done with the game and to put it away for good.I do hope you have fun with the game! It took me the full 116 hours (as of this review) to feel like I was satisfied with the game and had done everything I wanted to do, and I don't regret getting it.; 28 April;

The Survivalists;A;NOT INFORMED;97 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 6.0 hrs on record;"This game was released as a 1.0 version product. This means that it's feature complete (NOT an Alpha) and it's tested (NOT a Beta). As such, as a reviewer, I can only in good faith review it as such. I am aware of future announcements for the game and the promise of more content, but if the developers wanted it reviewed that way, they should have released it as an Alpha (feature incomplete) in Early access. This game DOES have some potential, but I won't review a title based off promises. As it stands, this title feels like a product, not a game. It seems like an idea that was cobbled together to make 30 minutes of playable game so that youtubers and advertisers can exploit children. I'll be happy to be mistaken, but that's the impression I get.As an additional preword, I didn't like The Escapists and think they wouldn't have looked out of place on Kongregate or some other free flash game website.While The Escapists I would describe as ankle deep, this title I would describe as knee deep. What you're doing at one point in the game won't change much to what you're doing 5 hours later. While in other survival titles might see you advance through a dynamic tech tree, figuring things out as you go and gatherering materials, this title sees you follow a linear and static tech tree as you sit around watching monkeys auto gather and your numbers get higher like a mobile game. There is absolutely no ""Survival"" to speak of. Food is immediately abundant, you don't drink, you don't get cold or hot, sick, poisoned, diseased or anything that might be considered ""survival"". Survival itself doesn't even seem to be a consideration in this survival game. As a title in the genre, it feels like it was made by lizards who saw the fundamental elements of every successful game, then they proceeded to remove all of the fun and replace it with a sterile version of what a survival title is when written on a piece of paper and read by an executive that's never played a videogame.The monkeys themselves are a core component of the gameplay. Your human character with a fully developed brain can't learn anything, in fact getting WORSE at most tasks as they continue to do it, complaining about how ""Bored"" they are by having to literally stay alive. Conversely, the monkeys level up and get better at tasks, get more efficient at using tools and are generally just better at everything, tool usage included. Then the monkey training happens and it's counter intuitive. You want to train a monkey to haul things to a workstation. You enter training mode and show him how to do it. But because you didn't access a chest and take an item out during the training, the monkey will only deliver items that are left on the ground. Now okay. This makes sense. ""Realism"" or whatever. So why can monkeys learn better than a human? The game flip-flops over itself trying to balance ""reality"" with ""fun"" and fails at every conceivable junction. Like every single opportunity where the developers thought. ""Do we make this realistic or make it enjoyable for the player?"", they never chose to make it enjoyable to the player. You're left with an experience that feels like a chore. In many other survival titles, you're doing chores but it's fun. In this title, you're playing a game and it feels like doing chores and I can't descibe why, which is why I'm convinced it was designed by lizards who just don't understand the human brain. All the parts are there and it should be fun, but it isn't.This title is nearly half the price of Cyberpunk 2077. Just let that sink in for a moment before you purchase it and then maybe wait for a sale. Support the developers if you actually believe they're going to improve, but for a general audience, there's absolutely no way that I would suggest someone buy this title. Go play Green Hell or Minecraft or something. At least you'll get a feeling at some point during the game that you need to survive.";15 October, 2020;

The Survivalists;do;NOT INFORMED;222 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 10.0 hrs on record;"Edit: Strokethrough a few lines to reflect the current patch. Recommendation remains the same.The game starts nice and simple... and stays just nice and simple throughout, just with more monkeys. I'd say it is correctly described by the ""casual"" tag, just... too casual for the asking price. I've tried to find its charm, but its flaws and deficiencies far outweigh its nice things.The premise of the game is promising, but the execution is poor. Other than aesthetics, your character is exactly the same from the beginning to the end. no skills, experience, stats improvements, etc. The survival aspect is absolutely minimal, with only a very limited stamina pool, some mostly negligible hunger meter, health and the ever present you-must-consume-potion-to-survive-biome gimmick. There are tiered weapons and tools, but these are mostly wasted on you, as your monkeys can use them more efficiently, both due to their increasing skill stat and from sheer number of them... and then there is little incentive to use anything beyond the basic stuff.Speaking of monkeys, the novelty of the game is quickly brought down by poor execution, and terrible controls/interaction. If you have two or three monkeys, it is mostly fine, but 5+ become incredibly annoying to manage. From terrible interactions with other parts of the game, to a faulty user interface, managing the army you will accrue becomes not a chore, but an annoyance.I truly don't know what exactly this game is about. It's not survival, as the ""survival"" elements can be mostly ignored or have a trivial solution. Not base building, as your options as fairly limited and you have no incentive to defend or improve, and everything is almost literally dirt-cheap. Not combat, as it is solved with low-tier weapons handled to enough monkeys. Not AI-based automation, since there is no real depth to the crafting system, the AI is quite lacking and you can't do anything to compensate for it.I cannot recommend this game at the time.If you want details...- Crafting and ""survival"": The game has a ""one button for all"" contextual scheme, which combined with the inescapable need to manually pick up, one by one, the pignata-level loot from mostly everything, makes it so that you will very frequently end up giving your pickaxe to your bow monkey, who promptly runs away with it and blends with your army before you can recover it, when you wanted to pick up the couple rubies you needed among the ton of overabundant crap on the floor. This, combined with the ludicrously limited inventory (which cannot be actually upgraded, mind you) , the ever so infuriating chest-carrying monkeys that run away from you when you want to access your ""extended"" inventory, the frustrating crafting tree, and so many obnoxious little big things, make the ""survival"" part of the game quite the annoyance after the first hour of gameplay. Numerous ""survival"" mechanics are just shallow, with barely any impact on your game experience. Health is pretty standard. Stamina is treated like a souls-like thing, with a pool that would allow just a couple rolls, or swings from your weapon/axe/pick, before you are ""too tired""... but recover completely a few seconds later with no real penalty (seriously, if you overexert, the stamina will recover FASTER than if you had managed your resource). Also, there are biomes in the game, that will require you to progress in your tech/crafting-tree or buy from the in-game merchant to get immunity from the barely annoying life-draining gimmick they induce... fairly standard I guess, but lacks any kind of sense of progression nor carry a narrative punch.- Combat: It exists, but your undying monkeys are more than enough to handle everything in the game. You don't need the sky-rendering, earth-sundering, eleventh-hour sword, just give three monkeys a couple bone and steel clubs and you are done. There are periodic ""raids"" to your base, which mostly consists of a couple baddies clumsily clubbing at your stuff and house-keeping monkeys. All the structures you build are mostly made out of overabundant materials, like pebbles, sticks and leaves, so all true incentive to defend comes from the mild inconvenience of resetting the blueprints, while your monkeys do all the work... or maybe why bother at all! Just set another camp on another island, why not.- Interface, user experience and AI: Awful, terrible, abysmal. From the ""everything is solid, you cannot walk here because there is some bush/rock/tree/unidentified piece of rubble obscured by foliage/mountain"", the ""you want to craft the frequently used D? Well, you better start manually crafting several Cs, a ton of Bs and innumerable As, all made from pebbles and grass... and progressively just adding more grass and pebbles to each product"", to the ""which one of you monkeys has my axe?!"", ""I just wanted to train ONE monkey!"",";11 October, 2020;

The Survivalists;are;NOT INFORMED;76 people found this review helpful; Recommended 72.2 hrs on record;Monkey see… monkey do. I’m sure this is not the first review that started with those words, but it sums up much of the game. I’ve put in just over 70 hours on the game and feel I have a pretty good handle on it.The BasicsYou start the game ship wrecked, alone on an island. You little guy can gather resources of various types (wood, rock, etc) and build basic tools (flimsy axe, flimsy pickaxe, etc). Eventually you build a workstation, which allows you to build more things. Eventually you’ll build walls and floors and make a base. You can also farm and tame wild life to more efficiently acquire resources. Also you’ll make a raft and explore new islands with unique biomes with specific resources and enemies.Of course the highlight and unique quality of the game is the monkeys. As you explore the world, you’ll find monkeys in cages or monkeys just hanging around an area asking for a specific item. Once you free them or give them the item, they become one of your monkey minions. Any monkey minion can be trained to do a specific task by putting the monkey minion into “learn” mode, and have them watch you do a task (like chopping down a tree). You can also have them follow you, and if you give them a weapon, they will protect you (or at least try). I found this feature similar to the robots in Autonauts, but simplified considerably.The research tree is very simple. When you build an item in the tree, the next items become available. This is true for the initial construction, and the more advanced construction (using workstation, forge, etc). Further in the game you buy technologies from various sellers or gain them by beating bosses.There are NPCs throughout the world who will buy and sell things with you. There are bosses to beat.;30 January, 2022;

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition;Reiker;NOT INFORMED;1,649 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 69.1 hrs on record;15 Critical things AOE2 and AOE3 players need to know going into AOE41. Resource drop points are back from AOE2, which means resource upgrades were moved from the market back to the stockpile buildings. You'll be building wood camps, mining camps, and granaries again.2. There are now super boars on the map that give a ton of food when hunted, but need a bunch of gatherers to take down.3. No more batch training unless you're the Mongols or the Russians. Build more barracks, archery ranges and stables as a result.4. All civs age up the same way the AOE3 Asian Dynasties do: You pick one of two wonder options (You can only pick one unless you're the Chinese), you build the wonder, you age up. The only exception is the abbasid, who add upgrades to a wonder they start with in age 1 instead. 5. There's a new influence mechanic that boils down to something similar to the Hausa: If you build certain buildlings in proximity with one another, you get bonuses. Farms near granaries are an example.6. AOE2 Wonder Victory is back, where if you build a wonder (Not the age up wonders, a bigger more expensive one) and hold it for a set time you win the game. With this, turtling is now a viable strategy again. 7. AOE3 Trade Monopoly Victory is now Sacred Site Victory, where if you can capture all the sacred sites with monks and keep at least one unit on each of them until the 10 minute timer runs out, you win the game. This is mostly a counter strategy to 6, valuing aggressive play and map control. (Stack villagers on the points to hold them longer if you're going for the final countdown)8. Markets are different, where you build trade caravans and have them cross the map going to specific trade buildings rather than town centers to make gold. 9. Walls are actually awesome now, and you can stack ranged troops on stone walls to deter enemies. Any archers on walls get 2/3rd damage reduction. You actually need siege equipment to take stone walls down too, adding extra layers of strategy to siege gameplay. 10. Farms don't cost anything to reseed anymore. No more wasting a bunch of wood on farm regrowth.11. Animals don't decay now, so don't worry about your villagers killing a bunch of sheep by accident anymore.12. You can't wall with buildings anymore, as your units and enemy units can go between them. This means no more units getting stuck, but this also makes walls even more important than before. 13. No more infinitely burning buildings, as they will eventually burn down if lowered to around a quarter health without being repaired. 14. Siege weapons are no longer dragged by horses, which is a big regression on their aesthetic from AOE3. I hope they end up changing it eventually. They do still have AOE3 setup times though, so you can't kite with them like in AOE2. 15. Sheep will now follow scouts around, but move extremely slowly and have barely any vision without them. No more sheep scouts in the early game. Feel free to comment anything I missed;29 October, 2021;

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition;6;NOT INFORMED;347 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 61.1 hrs on record; Fröb 85 products in account;15 November, 2021 Age of Empires is one of the biggest representatives of the strategy game sector. Many people of my generation grew up with AoE1 or AoE2 and so the announcement of Age of Empires 4 as a more modern version of the series was greatly anticipated. After taking a first look in the game I now want to give my opinion about it (for the build 7274).POSITIVE:AI: The AI is not a cheating mess like in AoE3 DE but yet also not as skilled as in AoE2 DE. Still, it varies its tactics, often uses early rushes to put pressure on the player and can sometimes build appropriate walls.Stone Walls: Units can now be placed on stone walls. Furthermore, archers can’t shoot above them and only siege units can actually damage them, which makes them really feel like a bulwark.Recruitment Time: Due to the overall high recruitment times you won’t encounter endless waves of units and actually will have an advantage once you destroy your opponents army.Landscape and Building Graphics: While I would describe the buildings as good looking, especially the landscapes with the varying altitude levels look beautiful.Gunpowder Units: All gunpowder units from infantry to siege cannons feel very impactful due to smoke effects and sound design.Sound: The sound of this game is simply amazing! The language of the units changes depending on the age as well as on the terrain your units are and the battles feel way more authentic due to the battle noise.Technical Aspects: Regarding the technical side there is nothing I could complain about. The performance is good as well as the loading times. In my first 16 h of playing I have not experienced a CTD once.NEGATIVE:Unit Graphics: Unfortunately, the level of detail on the units is so low that they look like they were made back in 2008.Build-Up Time of Siege Weapons: Siege weapons can build up and dismantle way too quick which not only feels weird but also makes them unbalanced. Unit Pathing: Usually, the unit pathing is ok but especially if you construct siege engines on the field or have a big battle the units start ‘sliding’ alongside each other which looks ridiculous.AI Representation: The AIs have no unique names anymore (like in AoE2) and don’t mock you anymore with messages (like in AoE3) which makes them feel a bit more lifeless.NEUTRAL:UI: The UI is very minimalistic, easy to read but a bit in contrast to the otherwise colourful game.No Friendly Fire: There is no friendly fire which is especially impactful when using mangonels.Guided Missiles: Sometimes the projectiles fly in a weird arc to hit their target. On the other hand, this also means that no excessive micromanagement is necessary like dodging arrows in AoE2.Victory Conditions: The victory conditions are a little bit different compared to the older games. You don’t have to destroy your enemy completely anymore or wait for him to resign – instead you must destroy his landmarks. But this means that you can also destroy your enemy by sniping his landmarks and he will automatically loose even if he still has a running economy and/or a huge army. Also, relocating your base in case your original spawn point gets overrun is only possible if you can construct a new landmark somewhere else, otherwise you will lose.Campaigns: I haven’t played the campaigns a lot since the custom matches are the major aspect of Age of Empires. So, I can’t say much about them. I only noticed that the video scenes between the missions were incredibly well made. But somehow, I have the feeling that resources which were spend for this should rather have been invested in the unit models.Population Limit: The population limit is currently 200 which feels balanced and sufficient. Still, it can be seen a bit like a downgrade compared to the custom population limit of the other parts of the series.Civilisations: The base game has currently 8 civisations which are very different and have their own mechanics each. This might seem like a loss compared to the 20+ civilisations in AoE2 DE but on the other hand they really offer different play styles. Only the unit variety feels a bit lacking since all of them share the same base units.MISSING FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS:Map EditorCustom Player ColoursMod Support'Random' Option for Civilisation SelectionAll in all, Age of Empires 4 is a great game. Especially, if you can play it with some friends. Though, 60;

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition;Say;NOT INFORMED;653 people found this review helpful11 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 73.6 hrs on record;I might be in the minority here as a single player who avoids multiplayer like the plague. My problem is that this game's campaign pales in comparison to the original campaigns launched with AOE2 in that it plays nothing more than a cheap tutorial on how to play the game. To put it another way, the campaign only exist to serve the multiplayer by being one big multiplayer tutorial that has no replayability value like AOE2 campaigns. While I would be wrong to compare the single player experience of this game 1 year into release with AOE2 that has received multiple updates and new campaigns over many years, it's obvious by now that this game's focus is multiplayer and not single player, especially with the launching of new civs without any new campaigns to accompany them unlike in AOE2.As a history fan myself like many AOE players, I couldnt hear the end of how everyone was loving the mini-documentaries included in the campaigns. But it is a double-edged sword because while these mini-documentaries are well made, they are likely very expensive to produce, which means that if they do think about adding in new campaigns, they will have to consider the huge production cost it would take to also make the mini-documentaries that would go with them, and the cynic in me tells me they will use this as an excuse to not make any new single player campaigns. Therefore the mini-docs serve as nothing more than marketing material to sell the game, in exchange for its long term growth and potential.And how can I end this without complaining about the UI, and this is someone who can tolerate Paradox Interactive UIs. Gone are the different UI themes for different civs, in with the cheap and the uninspired with every button being the same gold color on a blue background, and the symbols on each button might as well be hieroglyphs in terms of their readability. It's kinda important whenever playing an RTS to not have buttons on your UI where you are constantly asking yourself just what the hell is this button supposed to do at a glance because of how poorly they are designed.While this review does sound overwhelmingly negative, it would be narrow-minded of me to say that this is a bad game. It is a good game and still has that gold AOE standard that you can expect from almost all the games in this franchise. But like many other game franchises with many sequels, at some point you realise when a game in that franchise is no longer being made for you, and that's ok.;11 November, 2022;

It's only available through events and missions. This is absolutely INSANE.So much potential wasted due to baffling decisions and corporate greed. They locked the ability to test out characters and skins in practice, removed our universal currency of Gold and replaced it with 3 different Mobage BS currencies, including ""prestige"" which is basically a VIP system. Pay more money, get more prestige currency, use prestige currency to unlock the most wanted cosmetics. Many people held onto gold so they could buy new characters, now everyone starts with 0 fighter currency and if you have character tickets you CAN'T use fighter currency to unlock new characters, you're forced to use the tickets. Skins that were previously available in the shop for Gold are now $15. At $10 a pop it would cost $240 to unlock the entire roster. Last year we were told all our progress and content would carry over. That was a lie.(5/31 Edit:) As of May 31st, Multiversus has officially stated they will NOT be allowing founders to use fighter currency until ALL their character tickets are gone. Player First Games is REMOVING players autonomy, this is how you repay the people who believed in you? Forcing them to use character tickets/battle pass tokens knowing once they run out they'll be forced to pay money for new characters because the fighter currency is excruciatingly difficult to come by?In the ""beta"" you earned various cosmetics like profile icons and badges for leveling characters. All of those have been removed in place of small amounts of the Mobage currencies. We also received EXP books to help level our characters, those have been completely removed from the game and all our levels have been reset. What happened to the character mastery rewards you ask? They're being sold in the shop for real money obviously!Characters are locked for local play so RIP offline scene and any idea of this being a casual party game you could throw on. To add insult to injury they used one of the 3 comeback slots on a background character from adventure time, knowing they already pissed off 99% of their playerbase with weird additions such as 2 Gremlins. Are you targeting kids or people over the age of 35? You can't add joke characters when you have a tiny roster and scammed people out of their money because you didn't know how to run a live service game. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Banana Guard, like every other decision made for this relaunch, was a mistake. The battle pass can ONLY be progressed through missions and events. You earn ZERO battle pass XP through gameplay. There is no incentive to keep playing after you finish your dailies, if the gameplay loop was satisfying enough to stand on its own, the game wouldn't have died the first time. If you take a week or two off say goodbye to any chance you have of finishing the battle pass. Oh, and weeklies are locked behind character specific missions. At least 1 character per season will be locked behind the battle pass that is scheduled to last for 8 weeks. If you want to play Jason you'll need to buy the $10 battle pass or wait 2 months. This didn't work for Overwatch and it won't work for Multiversus. There's also a current battle pass taunt being sold in a store bundle for Bugs Bunny. Ranked is still missing. Nevermind the fact the game runs like a PS3 trying to play Cyberpunk 2077 on BOTH Xbox and Playstation, one of the main complaints in the ""beta"" was the lack of incentive to play. Ranked is marked as ""coming soon"" with no further explanation. Leaderboards and end of game stats have been removed. If you enjoyed climbing the ladder to see you're the 182nd best Shaggy on the server, tough scooby snacks. No ladder. no damage dealt. no ring outs. How do you spend a year reworking the game and spend more time REMOVING features than adding them?The ""Rift"" PvE mode is some Pay to Win BS the likes of which we haven't seen since Maplestory and I'm not joking. The rift is comprised of nodes that ping-pong between AI fights and a few minigames. Gems are basically equipment that add buffs. You fight the same AI at different difficulty levels to farm gems and stars. Completing rift challenges earns you more stars/gems. Get 100 stars to clear a difficulty level and claim the final rewards. In order to FULLY complete a single Rift node, you MUST play with a friend, otherwise you will be missing stars and ineligible for the final rewards and gem level ups. But wait, there's NO online matchmaking for PvE OR Couch co-op! So unless you and a friend want to spend DAYS running through these missions 6x over you can forget about it. Some Rift nodes require characters or special skins, if you don't have them you can't play the mission.Who on earth makes a PvE mode with a psuedo co-op requirement and NO online matchmaking for said mode? It's as ridiculous as locking all characters and skins for local play. But don't fret, you can purchase gems in the cash shop and maybe after spending a few hundred bucks on gem gacha you'll be powerful enough to beat the highest levels that also happen to be time-gated. But that's not even the best part. At the highest diffculties, character damage transfers and you have a limited amount of lives that refresh daily. Want to keep playing? Lives can be bought! (6/4 Edit): The ""Insanity"" difficulty unlocked today which revealed it costs 15 DOLLARS to refresh all your lives the FIRST time. The cost increases after every purchase and eventually prohibits you from spending until the next day. This is a mobile game masquerading as a fighting game. Hell is hot, but it's nothing compared to where Money First Games and Warner Brothers are going. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ABOMINATION. (6/5 Edit:) Money First Games announced today that the ability to buy lives was a ""bug."" They are gaslighting and lying to their entire playerbase. You wrote code, made several UI elements and have in-game text EXPLICITLY telling players they could purchase more lives. The lives were also priced so that you would need to either spend $20 or make two transactions of $10 and $5. This company has so much disdain for their players they would rather lie and insult our intelligence than be honest and admit the negative feedback caused them to course correct. This is unforgivable and an omen of what's to come.Characters are buggy, skins and various cosmetics are missing from the ""beta"", the camera zooms in like it's invading your personal space during 1vs1s, and matches terminate 30-45 seconds into the fight.Multiversus as a concept is so phenomenal it has captured the attention of hundreds of thousands of people TWICE, but it is run by arguably the greediest and most incompetent group of people to ever set foot in the gaming space, Blizzard be damned. Player First Games has no business calling themselves that when time after time they do what is the exact opposite of the player's best interest. Barring some divine intervention such as common sense and transparency with the player base, I see no future for this game and expect it to sink deeper than the Lost City of Atlantis in record time.I genuinely wanted this game to do well, it's such a shame the people behind it don't feel similarly. Save your money and your time, they don't deserve either. (5/31 Edit): Money First Games has dug their heels into the sand and is standing firmly on their anti-consumer practices. As a result, I genuinely look forward to the announcement of this games second death, Money First Games studio closure, and will be back to dance on their respective graves.

It also starts off cute and whimsical, but still manages to tell a serious story with a pretty profound message.But crucially- and this is the highest praise I could ever levy at a video game- it's funny. Genuinely, wickedly, profoundly funny. Every NPC has a good joke. Every single piece of trash used for set dressing is an incredible reference.

Some of the jokes might hit better with certain audiences, but as someone who is a little jaded and a lot online, every single line had me in stitches.

Another Crab's Treasure;Dmott;NOT INFORMED;197 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 13.3 hrs on record;This game is MUCH darker than the advertisements and reviews are letting on and I LOVE it. This is a game that understands the souls genre on a narrative level and delivers a narrative worthy of its competition. I was incredibly impressed with this game's story and the more days that pass after playing it, the more I grow convinced that it's one of the best stories I've experienced playing a video game - or at the very least, it features one of the best protagonists I've ever played. The combat is also solid, though it gets a bit stale towards the later half of the game due to the enemy variety not being all that incredible. I just found myself growing bored of the enemies and couldn't be bothered to fight most of them - often sprinting past them to get to the next boss or story segment. Still, I HIGHLY recommend this game for the story alone. The combat is FUN, just not incredible.; 25 April;

Children of Morta;foxhull;514 products in account;135 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 55.9 hrs on record;RELEASE EDIT: Now that I've had a chance to sink my teeth into the game and unlock and play all the characters, as well as beat the entirety of Caeldippo Caves (the first section of areas) - it holds up extremely well. The pre-alpha/Kickstarter promise has been delivered on. Gameplay:Each character not only plays differently, but *feels* different to play. On paper Kevin and Mark are similar at first glance. both are fast melee attackers with great mobility. In practice? Kevin switches between a frenzied flurry of daggers to silent and stealthy takedowns, where as Mark controls the enemies around and flips and dives around the battlefield.Each area has felt distinct in their own manners so far, and while it doesn't seem like there's a ton of items to find in runs at first, once you unlock Runes for your skills, between Relics, Graces, Runes and Charms each run, even with the same character in the same area can play out very differently. Example: I played a fair bit of Kevin during the Caves while I tried to get his assassin style abilities unlocked. I found a charm that removed my ability to evade, but granted me greatly increased dodge chance and movement speed. Combine that with extra attack speed, damage scaling on attack speed, chance to heal on hit and several other items, I was able to take what was previously a challenging boss to the area and utterly shred it to bits.There are incentives to play each family member, as you are able to unlock family-wide passives for each character, as well as picking and choosing how you want to build your character via a unique skill tree for each character. Combine that with between run customization in the form of family-wide stat buffs and similar upgrades you can unlock and even the worst runs will still provide some sort of progress.Visuals, Sound, Story:Beautifully crafted pixel art, smooth animations and a wonderfully detailed world. This is a prime example of pixel art done right, and it really lends to the narrative, which is provided in vignettes between runs. Speaking of the narrative, there's not only an overarching narrative, but a great deal of smaller stories and details interspersed throughout the game, which really helps to bring it all to life. The attention to detail of the family's life, as well as a very fitting narrator and excellent sound design really brings it all together and pulls you into the world.Recommended? Absolutely yes. Pick up this gem and enjoy.EDIT: Finally have my hands on the full game, I'll update the review after some playtime!So far, only Kickstarter backers of a certain tier and above are able to play the pre-alpha build, and for a pre-alpha build this is already quite good. I've run into maybe one bug and some minor nitpicks, but for the most part the game plays buttery smooth, each of the three currently available characters plays quite differently, and despite nominally completing the current content (there's more than just going through the caves and beating the boss, there's at least one quest that persists over multiple runs), I still haven't found everything there is to be found, and some of the things I've run into I haven't figured out. Game is fun and I look forward to more!;18 March, 2016;

Children of Morta;Milena;2,394 products in account;73 people found this review helpful; Recommended 28.8 hrs on record;This is a really beautiful and wholesome game. I don't particularly love rogue-like games, so this liter version was much more to my liking. As you still keep the exp and money even if your character dies, the game keeps a feeling of constant progression and never feels frustrating.Gameplay itself is fun and each Bergsons has distinct abilities and skills, so I was never bored, despite facing the same enemies multiple times (there are 3 main areas, each with 2-3 dungeons). The game kinda punishes you for selecting the same character over and over, so you'll have to level several (if not all) family members along the way.I loved the narrator's voice and the little story bits each time you returned to the house. I was also really impressed by the art style, great job there!All in all this is very good game and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a more relaxed rogue-like game with a nice story.;31 July, 2020;
Children of Morta;obsidian_whiskers;NOT INFORMED;55 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 48.3 hrs on record;I’ve actually tried out a lot of Action Roguelites in local coop with my wife in the last months, and judging from that experience I just have to say, Children of Morta is definitely one of the (if not THE) best representative of this genre I played. Everything is fair, progression feels fluid, the family characters with their various abilities are extremely different and fun to play. And best of all, the game even encourages you to actually play every one of them by giving you perk rewards for the other characters if you develop them, so no run feels in vain. Add to that loads of items to discover with widely different behavior and game-changing potential, all the while combat feels very responsive and even allows for strategic fights (e.g. you can withdraw to safer positions). But what really makes the game extraordinary in my opinion is the special blend of procedural level design mixed with certain (randomized) scripted events in those levels. Each run something new happens, a little story on the side here, an item or souvenir to find there, characters to unlock, merchants to be freed (who again grant their own benefits in future runs), the list goes on and on. And to top it off, after a run or after restarting the game there are always some scripted little narrated scenes to bring the story and the family in their house (the hub) truly to life in a really awesome pixel style. That said, I admit that most of the lore elements sometimes can be a little weird and hard to follow, but to be honest, it doesn’t matter. It’s kind of a legend, alright, so just accept it as it is. Anyway, through all those little details and things happening there’s never a feeling of repetitiveness or grinding that’s sometimes typical for the genre. I mean, just look at my playtime, we actually spent nearly 50 hours in this game (Main Story mode) until we 100%ed it, and really loved every minute. I’m actually sad that it’s over, that’s how good it was.Which reminds me, I definitely would encourage you to buy the Paws and Claws DLC as well, as it adds some nice side stories to the levels as well as playful animals and an animal shelter to the house (which again gives perks and bonuses).;8 July, 2021;

Then the updates were monthly and unaddressing of major issues like 20+ minute waits for matchmaking. Then they went on a full month holiday break 3.5 months into their rapidly declining game, they come back from break and weeks later drop a nothing burger of an update and it's apparent that they aren't trying to make this a fun game anymore, they're over their own cashgrab already and so am I.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre;Shrek2;NOT INFORMED;479 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 928.0 hrs on record;As a player who has spent almost 800 hours with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game, I feel compelled to share my thoughts, especially for those considering diving into this experience.First and foremost, this game is not beginner-friendly. New players are at a severe disadvantage due to the necessity of leveling up perks and gaining map knowledge. While seasoned players enjoy the benefits of fully upgraded perks, newcomers are left struggling for at least 6 hours, putting them at a significant disadvantage from the outset.Moreover, the developers' behavior towards negative feedback is unacceptable. Instead of addressing constructive criticism, they choose to attack players on their subreddit, dismissing valuable input and fostering a toxic community environment.Another glaring issue is the sluggish pace of updates. Waiting up to two months for an update is frustrating, especially when crucial issues remain unaddressed. Additionally, the lack of communication from the developers further exacerbates player frustration and disconnect.The limited roadmap, only extending until August 2024, raises concerns about the game's longevity as a live service title. Charging $40 for a game with such a short-term roadmap feels unjustifiable, particularly when considering the myriad of unresolved issues and lack of transparency.Furthermore, the introduction of pay-to-win characters adds insult to injury. Characters like Danny, priced at $10 each, offer significant gameplay advantages, creating an uneven playing field. The reliance on such characters for essential tasks, like opening the fuse and pressure gate, further undermines the game's integrity and fairness.In summary, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game fails to deliver a satisfactory experience due to its steep learning curve, developer hostility towards feedback, slow updates, lack of communication, short-term roadmap, and pay-to-win mechanics. As such, I cannot recommend this game to others.; 14 February;

Rayman® Legends;[AReV]Nomed;NOT INFORMED;270 people found this review helpful; Recommended 34.0 hrs on record;Rayman Legends is quite possibly the best 2d platformer released in the past 10 years.It’s the follow up title to Rayman Origins (also a great game) and if you missed it, 40 of the stages from Origins have been included in Legends as additional re-mastered content.It features over 120 different stages each with varying atmosphere, amazing music, and plenty of hidden collectibles. Each of the levels are hand drawn and beautiful to look at. Despite not being overly impressive on a technical level, Rayman uses a timeless style. While games like Crysis 3 probably won’t look that great 10 years from now, Rayman Legends will no doubt retain its charm.The game also has multiple characters to choose from along with a host of unlockables. There are underwater stealth missions, time trials, and even musical stages where you jump to the rhythm of remixed popular songs. The inclusion of daily and weekly challenges allows you to compete with your friends, adding tons of re-playability.If you enjoyed classic 2d platformers like Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country, you should check out Rayman Legends as it’s the closest thing to them in this day and age.For a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195783687Rayman Legends also made our list for The Top 35 Games of the Generation.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps;ready2b;741 products in account;477 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 13.9 hrs on record;The whole map essentially becomes a delightful playground with hidden nuggets/collectibles in every nook and cranny. Thanks to the responsive controls, the different mechanics can easily be combined with one another to result in fast, agile, and fluid movement - which happens to be the perfect accompaniment for the exciting escape sequences and the thrilling boss fights.[+] Emotional and thrilling storytelling. The incredible writing and direction, supported by the beautiful art and the divine OST makes the whole experience feel like a fairytale brought to life. I wouldn’t dare to deprive you from such a wonderful story by spoiling it here, so do yourself a favor and get the game. I will openly admit that I cried like a baby multiple times.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169324939[+] This sequel makes several notable improvements compared to the first game:Auto-save.Thank God they removed the manual save system introduced in the first game.New combat system! Ori no longer has only the auto-lock on spirit fire attack, which I personally didn’t care for. Instead you can unlock and upgrade multiple abilities (including melee and ranged attacks), which can be assigned to the X, Y, B (Square, Triangle and Circle for PlayStation) buttons at your leisure. Combat options were lacking in the original so really appreciate this customization upgrade. Personally, I couldn’t get enough of the giant hammer and Shock Smash upgrade. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177313275Addition of equipables! Similar to the charms in Hollow Knight, Ori can now equip Spirit Shards (equippable items that provide upgrades to you or your abilities). Again, I find that the customization options allow for a more self-tailored experience. I basically had two sets of Spirit Shards that suited my playstyle: one for exploration and one for combat.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2177313407Improvements to the map and teleportation. The map immediately displays any warpstone and collectable you come across without requiring a map upgrade first (as was the case in the original). The map also makes it abundantly clear where the objective is, which areas you have and haven’t explored yet, and it even shows your latest movement in the form of a dotted line, making it incredibly difficult to get lost or disoriented. Furthermore, you can now teleport to any warpstone from any location, which greatly reduces the necessity for backtracking and helps to keep the pace of the game up. Addition of side quests is always a blessing. Several great side quests were included in this title but there was one in particular that I really enjoyed: “hand to hand”. It is essentially a trade sequence quest where you aid the next NPC by providing them with the item the previous NPC gave you. Helping the many creatures felt like I was contributing to the livelihood of the forest.Addition of a main hub. Important NPCs, such as vendors, relocate to the main hub in Wellspring Glades, after you meet them in the wild. Since the land is plagued by corruption and is tyrannized by the evil Shriek, NPCs will immigrate to this safe haven, inadvertently creating a diverse community. By offering resources, such as Gorlek ore and mysterious seeds, found during your journey to Grom (builder) and Tuley (gardener), you are also able to upgrade the main hub until it turns into a lively village. Investing in the community felt rewarding, and encouraged me to search for all the collectable items and help all NPCs.[+] The game provides the necessary tools to unlock everything without relying on external help/guides.If collecting everything is your cup of tea (it certainly is mine), then you will probably appreciate this point. There are map upgrades you can either buy or obtain which mark the location of all missing collectables, making them much easier to obtain. Furthermore, if you need to farm for more currency, Spirit Shards can be used to speed up the process. for example, by combining Consume (Enemies have 70% more Life and deal 70% more damage, but drop double currency) with Turmoil (Enemies respawn faster).[+] Perhaps a minor detail but the game automatically pauses if your controller disconnects. Kudos, Moon Studios.?Neutral:[-] I enjoyed playing it so much that finishing it felt bitter-sweet.As much as I loved the game, I felt sad knowing that it would be a while before another game would blow me away like this again. I’m sure most of us have at least one game that we wish we would wipe from our memories and replay again - Ori and the Will of the Wisps falls under this category. Can’t wait for the next installment!??Verdict:????? MarvellousA practically-flawless sequel and a must-have if you enjoyed Ori and the Blind Forest.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps;Uli;NOT INFORMED;166 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 25.7 hrs on record;For anyone who didn't play the predecessor Ori and the Blind Forest, I highly recommend playing that one first! It's cheaper, it's shorter, it has fewer abilities to get used to, and it's generally less difficult. If you like the first Ori, you'll probably like the second one too (I did)! For anyone who played Ori and the Blind Forest, you'll probably love this one too! But just in case, here is what changed / was expanded upon:- It's roughly twice as long (100% completion on hard without hardcore achievements like one life)- It has all the original movement abilities and multiple new ones, which lets you zip through the air more than ever before. :) And that becomes necessary too in many sections- There is much higher focus on different combat abilities: Fast melee, heavy melee, fast ranged, heavy ranged, and they're all viable to play too! This is the biggest change, so if you absolutely dislike platformer combat, check out some gameplay videos first. No, it's not as difficult as Hollow Knight!- Another big change: no more manual saving (!) That really took getting used to, but the autosaves are very frequent, so you never lose considerable progress, no worries. Also, there are multiple autosaves, so you shouldn't be able to softlock your save.- There are escape sequences again, one of which is far more difficult than any in Blind Forest but has been supposedly toned down a bit since a day before writing this review- There are now bossfights alongside the escape sequences (but they're not awful, you don't get oneshot or anything)- Spirit light is now a currency and you can use it to buy upgrades (basically like before), get new combat abilities, and upgrade your upgrades+abilities. No, you will never get stuck if you skip everything, the progress-required abilities are all free- There are now collectibles which you can equip to give you some passive effects (risk-reward combat effects, upgrades to your ranged abilities, movement abilities etc.)- There are also collectibles to make your haven prettier, the place where you can buy stuff - There are multiple optional quests which reward you with equippable upgrades or spirit light to buy stuff- There is a way to see all secrets on the map by the near end of the game, which is great for anyone who wants to 100% without an external map (like me)Highly recommended, one of my favorite platformers :);4 May, 2020;

Destiny 2;DTG;NOT INFORMED;1,204 people found this review helpful29 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,063.7 hrs on record;"With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:This overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it really shines.The gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.The game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (""Darkness Zones"" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). With that said, dungeons (there are several, but 'Prophecy' is free to all players) and raids (again, several of these, but both 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 are free to all players) are best experienced with a team, and the new in-game Fireteam Finder feature is excellent for times when you don't want to deal with Discord LFG. Exotic missions, most of which can now be found on a weekly rotator menu option, come close to dungeons in quality while often being more bite-size but almost as rewarding - who doesn't love a guaranteed exotic.Of the matchmade multiplayer offerings (the game calls these Ritual playlists), I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive playlist, or other competitive modes like Trials of Osiris [behind the paywall] and Iron Banner[F2P]). The free gameshow-satire objective based mode Dares of Eternity is good mindless fun, while the challenging horde mode Onslaught pushes the combat sandbox of the game to its absolute limit. Seasonal content also introduce some great 3- and 6-person modes, but these require additional purchases and are (mostly) purged from the game with each major expansion release.Don't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.Some stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.For anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a veteran player to guide you. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (""What are random rolls? Which do I keep?"") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. The fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (""Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?"") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.If you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the ""learning the ropes"" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]Eyes up, guardian.Footnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Wish/Into the Light, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. -This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder, and nearly all of the content affected (aside from the Red War campaign and a few destinations) has been returned to the game in some for. I consider this, along with Bungie's commitment to never do either again, as much of an apology as we're going to get -- and an apology that I personally accept.-----------------TL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.-----------------Sites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)Beginner's Guide (Current as of Lightfall) -";1 October, 2019;

This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.I've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.It's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful. despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.I bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.Forsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a ???????? to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.The game may be ""Free to play"" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.Yes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:Raids, high quality but the same ones every timeStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new onesDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of varietySeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game storyCrucible with a ?????? tryhard meta and hardly any new mapsGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the poolSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every seasonNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.And it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration. Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that ""by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps"" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.And getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:OverwhelmingConfusingNo sense of clear directionAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlcWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)Any many more comments that made them not want to play the game.I know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.And i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.";13 July, 2023;
Destiny 2;Joe;NOT INFORMED;1,160 people found this review helpful14 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 1,038.7 hrs on record;"Until the senior leadership team (SLT) and Pete Parsons resigns, I see no point in continuing to play this game.SLT are solely responsible for the current state of Destiny that has been slowly simmering up until this point. Few Examples here:- A downright terrible and offensive Lightfall expansion (that cost $50 at launch BTW)- Lack of consistent ritual content, it took HOW MANY YEARS AND EMPTY PROMISES to get more Crucible maps? - The past two or so years have had issues with power creeping and loot feels less and less meaningful each season. Why bother chasing new stuff? its too late to address this now.- Seasonal content structure is stale and boring. People are tired of playing boring seasonal activities that irrelevant and throw away after a season. This has been a recurring thing since Season TWO.- Nobody at Bungie can decide if the non endgame content should be hard or easy. Constant whiplash of buffs and nerfs, its impossible to keep up. - Predatory monetization and over abundance of micro transactions. $50 expansions with $50 deluxe editions. $20 armor sets. Like when is enough?- Inconsistent quality of story telling and plot delivering. How can this be some sort of epic conclusion when the past 9 years have seen one good campaign (The Witch Queen) and everything was mediocre to good at best? Hell, before Beyond Light, a large chunk of the story telling was in lore books hidden away. No matter how The Final shape ends up, good or bad, will it feel fulfilling? Hell no!- The lack of the new player experience. This has been a problem since they vaulted a bunch of content in Beyond Light. Its been over 3 years since that happened HOW is there STILL no adequate new player experience? People have been asking for this and we still have yet to see anything meaningful.I could keep going but this is off the top of my head. I'm so tired of the ""we hear you"" and promises that never get fulfilled. SLT could have led their team of very talented developers to fix and address the game's core pain points. But they are too busy ignoring their own team's feedback and player feedback. Instead, they are figuring out what the best way to further monetize and exploit players for more money is. I will no longer support Destiny or Bungie until their SLT is gone. They think they know what is best for the game but they have zero idea what is needed for a healthy state of the game and refuse to change. And when their vision fails, they layoff the people who implemented their vision instead of taking responsibility. How is that fair? Destiny is one of the best examples of a ""what if"". So much missed potential due to a few individuals who seek profit and money over anything else. Look at what happened at 343i, they cleaned up shop and Halo Infinite is slowly and surely getting into a better spot. Thats what happens when you put the person who led the fix of the disastrous Master Chief Collection as studio head.I love this game. I hate saying this as if its some sort of +1 over other people to make my opinion worth more than others, but up through Season of the Deep, I was playing every single season / content drop since the Destiny 1 beta (except season of the worthy). But I am SO tired of the constant whiplash of good times and bad times, so its time to stop for good. It shouldn't have to be this way. I have met some great people playing this game and it sucks I cannot continue to play Destiny with them. Some of my favorite gaming moments and memories are from this game. But in its current state, stay away from this game, especially new players, there are way better ones out there that respect your time.";28 November, 2023;

You start the game up, grab some supplies with your friends, load up your ship, and set sail to see what fate awaits you.I offer this game an easy recommend under a couple of conditions. The first is that you like the chaos of unknown adventure, and the second is that you don't mind when it all goes pear shaped.Sea of Thieves has you being a pirate on the ocean with other players, sailing from island to island, fighting skeletons, ghost ships, digging up treasure, solving riddles, delivering cargo, and fighting sea monsters. And you never quite know what's going to happen next on your adventure. There's plenty of things to chase, and you'll never be without a task for long if you care to pick one up from one of the vendors.One important design choice that you should be aware of before jumping into this game is that every session is a fresh start. You spawn in with your ship and bare bone supplies, there's no progression between sessions aside from cosmetics you unlock. (Which is also the only thing you unlock, more on that below). While this can be a bit of a bummer, it's actually quite freeing. Every time you launch the game you're given a new ship, new supplies, and an ocean full of treasure to explore. Truly, you have nothing to lose. Until you find treasure, that is. Then you have something to lose. The game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sail, solo or with friends. And it's shockingly easy to play solo if you desire, the smallest ship, the Sloop, is very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirate.The only progression in this game is cosmetics. Anything else you get exists solely to get you, you guessed it, more cosmetics. This makes the cash shop a little weird. But hey, the upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better sword, ship, or guns.The game recently started a battle pass system with season one. The pass for season one is frankly a little underwhelming. I'm willing to give it a pass since the game is quite enjoyable without, but you're not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the pass.--Update--Since it's been a fair while and four full seasons since I first wrote this review, I felt it was time for an update. Overall, I still stand by the original review, with the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game. It certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the ship, you have to let it roll off you like water. If you let the bad moments cling to you like barnacles, then you'll be just as scuttled as your ships.Season Five just launched, and after a middling Season 2, Content Packed Seasons 3 and 4, Season 5 could be called the quality of life season. There's a decent chunk of new content (though nothing like the previous seasons, which is a reasonably high bar. 5 story missions in season 3, and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season 4?)The biggest quality of life change in S5 is being able to quickly and easily transfer resources from barrels and storage crates without having to open the interface. This along probably would have given me another 100 hours in the game, but they also decided to add a buried treasure system! Indeed, you can bury your treasure to create a treasure map. Then, you can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost! Other pirates can take this, and if they successfully sell your treasue...boom! You get rewarded too. How fantastic is that?It's even better than that though. You can take up to five treasure pers per in game day from the board (this amount is pretty reasonable I feel, the days go quickly in the sea of thieves), and these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own. Of course. Quality of treasure may vary, as it could be anything. Though there are commendations to encourage big, fruitful treasure maps. Really, it's a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.The best part of the whole treasure map system though? They're saved on your quests table as an item called a Map Bundle. What's that mean? It means if you sink, you lose your maps and need to recover the bundle. Or that other people could steal your maps. Or you could steal their maps, I guess, if you're a jerk. While the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunate, it's lovely design because it means they're transferable, you could gift the map bundle, or simply leave it at an outpost when you're done for someone else to find. It adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away. Or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure. It adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter over, and it means that should things go bad for all involves, the treasue may be lost to all.The game has been at it's best when it balances the thrill of gain with the risk of lose (even though the sting of loss can be quite painful, it's something we must learn to accept). Remember, the whole ocean is open to you, so long as you go in with the attitude that what happens, happens.;29 January, 2021;

I'm about 15 hours in, which isn't bad for me as a fairly casual gamer. Here's a quick story from last night:Had trouble finding a mission that I could actually connect to, so I decided to just poke around on my own to get some practice on Hard. I'm about ten minutes in and get totally swamped with bots from all sides. My sentries are putting in work, but I'm on my last mag and am basically sprinting through the forest to find some cover. I try to hit my resupply and accidentally hit the SOS thing.I swear it wasn't more than 15 seconds and a couple of folks jump into the mission. The first thing I hear on the mic?""Stay strong, brother. We're here to help.""These guys totally bulldoze through the next couple of bases and help me smash the last Hulk before a really gnarly exfil. I then played another THREE HOURS with the same squad. When they finally said that they had to hop off, I thanked them for the rescue. Their response?""For democracy"".Holy hell this is the game.*******EDIT 4/29/24Holy crap - you guys are insane! Thanks for all the love! Lots of naysayers in the comments, and fair enough. I will say though that this really did happen and it really did get me to fall in love with the game.

Arrowhead, with a much smaller team, accomplished what Rocksteady could not in the same amount of dev time. Gameplay loop is a blast, with procedurally generated missions giving what appears to be a lot of replay value. To me this is Deep Rock Galactic without the mining and a lot more emphasis on the bug killing. Being able to earn microtransaction currency means you can unlock everything in the game through gameplay. A breath of fresh air in the AAA multiplayer game space that seems motivated to squeeze every last dollar out of you. Highly recommend; 20 February;

Deep Rock Galactic;Herr;NOT INFORMED;678 people found this review helpful18 people found this review funny; Recommended 133.3 hrs on record;"Rock and Stone, reader, take a moment to read my review : In an era of unyielding greed where publishers release half-arsed games with day-one DLCs, an era where graphics are put before gameplay, an era of toxicity where people are just after their high score and shiny cosmetics - comes one of Steam's most underrated games : Deep Rock Galactic ! Yes I dare say Underrated !A game where you dig ore, and fight bugs . Simple as ? There is plenty of variation, and the developers make sure to periodically add something new to the mix - something new that is not behind any pay-wall or trickery.The moment you buy the game, there is no need to pay for anything else, unless you want to support the developers and get some tasteful , world-coherent cosmeticsGhost Ship Games have created a gameplay loop that is simplistic enough to follow , yet compelling enough that it does not get repetitive . Ever been into one of those co-op games where if one person has the wrong item or load-out, everyone loses ? Well not here, all builds are viable - no cookie cutting required, just point at the bug and shoot at it simple as .These people have put quality and community first and foremost But the most beautiful thing about this game is one simple thing, one thing that I have never seen in an online game in a long time and never to this extend : Cooperation ! You have never seen a game where strangers will work together and help each other quite like this . It's as if going back to the first days of a MMORPG where everyone is just glad to be there and glad to fulfill their roleIn the deep dangerous depths of Hoxxes, you aren't just the employees of a mysterious interplanetary mining corporation, you are not just strangers on a job - you are Brothers You must have played one of those mmorpgs where you just rush rush rush to the next objective ! Next marker, next checklist, next SHINY - when was the last time you danced and slammed ales with your brothers just for the fun of it ?! Well in this game, that is what you do bestThis ""silly game about dwarves"" has more soul into it than most games released within the last ten years , here in the big cold web you can find friendship .If you decide to buy this game, be sure to be the dwarf you wish to have at your side ! Here dear reader, you will find friendship.Be the Dwarf that Karl would approve of !";14 June, 2023;

I fully expected her to play it for about one or two missions and lose interest, as she generally does not have the knack for playing games that require focus and she doesn't enjoy games that have a gathering aspect.She chose Gunner, loaded into the game and proceeded to unleash hell on bugs, and on our entire team in the process. While she doesn't understand what's going on most of the time, she loves shooting the bugs and always gets excited when Mission Control yells ""SWARM!

I have made sure that she unlocked the friendly fire perk to try and mitigate the damage she does to her teammates.I have always found this game to be incredibly fun, but now, with my wife in the game, it's hilarious.

Deep Rock Galactic;Eyeless;378 products in account;497 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,035.2 hrs on record;UPDATED FOR 2023My review is lengthy, so I'll preface my paragraphs with a TL.DR:1. Can I have fun on Day 1? Yes. Jump right in. From Haz 1 to Haz 4 you can succeed with no upgrades or leveling.Just use good teamwork.2. How's the shooting?Most excellent. Some of the most satisfying gunplay I've experienced in years as a shooter-game guy.3.Difficulty?Fair and skill-based. You won't be out-leveling your foes with raw stats here. Aim well and PAY ATTENTION to your environment.4.Classes?Well balanced and uniquely fun.5.World?Incredibly varied and gorgeous. You'll need to learn a bit of platforming to figure out your next jump. Do it quickly, the horde approaches!6. Enemies? As varied as the environments. All dangerous. All fun to shoot. 7. Missions? Enough to keep things interesting and challenging in their own right. 8. Levels, upgrades, grind, and endgame?Leveling is decently fast, and you unlock the fun stuff at a respectable pace as well.You'll acquire everything you want at a decent pace that rewards you adequately for your time. Endgame missions (Deep Dives) are a fun test of personal prowess and your skills as a team!Even after acquiring everything, they remain a fun test of your dwarven moxxy.There is an element of randomness to acquiring the coveted overclocks these missions grant, which can be vexing due to the large loot pool. The devs have implemented other ways to acquire them, and this issue of acquisition has been acknowledged. I don't believe these systems hurt the overall fun of DRG though. As for ways to spend your money further - there's a refreshing lack of GACHA and FOMO involved. There IS a Season Pass system, but it's entirely free, and what you don't unlock (you have several months to do it by filling a big XP bar) gets added to the random loot pool for you to acquire on your own time.Now then, on to my big sales pitch...What I love about Deep Rock Galactic is that this game lacks a lot of the trifling, tedious things most modern games like to throw at you. This isn't an endless quest of RNG loot grinding a la Borderlands. You can pick up and play this without fretting that you're missing out on a full season of shallow rewards, cash shop exclusives, and time limited gear that is only relevant for that month's balance patch.Day 1 presents you with four unique classes which all play differently, with unique guns and terrain traversal tools which synergize between each other to help you mine, dig, and hunt down your objectives. Yes, there is leveling, resource gathering, and upgrades in the form of loadout upgrades and dwarf perks. However, the quest to these is a steady, well paced adventure that encourages you to journey inside ALL biomes, each of which present unique obstacles to traverse. From Hazard 1 (easiest difficulty) to Hazard 4 (highest before unlocking Hazard 5) you can succeed with no perks, upgrades, or even an hour spent on any one dwarf. All you need is situational awareness, a non-toxic attitude, (really, the playerbase is great!) and good shooting.Which brings me to the most important thing - The gunplay is excellent! Every weapon feels and sounds good. You're often asked to aim not just straight ahead, but up, down, at every wall, even the empty air. The enemy is everywhere, and it is endless. A continuous, remorseless horde of jaws and fangs that come from nowhere, in forms as varied as the eerie, sodden, frigid, hellish, and irradiated landscapes you will struggle through to reach either the mission's end - or your own. It can't be understated how integral the terrain is to gameplay. These aren't just randomly generated tunnels with some dips and ledges to make things a little more interesting. The formulae at which terrain is generated spawns places both beautiful yet also steeply treacherous and labyrinthine. You'll need your wits to safely navigate these, and bravery when the swarm descends. You aren't just shooting your way out, you're thinking on your feet as you platform over gaping chasms and vault yourself over erupting fire pits, the horde behind you immolated on the spot where you just were by a magma jet. It's gripping. It's tense... But the pacing is kind enough to offer you enough quiet moments to appreciate the glowing grandeur of towering crystals and glittering salt spires you may freely climb. Best part is it's all destructible. Dig it out into a defensive trench. Drill yourself an escape tunnel to reach a lost friend. Bait your enemies into a meadow of explosive fungus flowers... Or fall to your death down a very, very deep hole. There's a lot of possibilities under planet Hoxxes that require you to adapt quickly and think on your feet with the tools and guns provided to you. Customization is fun. There's an in-game shop with NO microtransactions whatsoever. You spend the gold you earn and the resources you've mined to buy yourself new beards, armor suits, and even skin colors. Along the way the game will also reward you with shinies to uncover in the environments themselves. Cargo Crates to uncover weapon skins, lost helmets with coordinates to backpacks holding armor skins or cosmetic pickaxe parts. You aren't charged an extra dime for any of this. Only a bit of your time and courage. There are DLC packs that are purely cosmetic, and the soundtracks are quite good too! These don't impact gameplay and are just to support the devs!The endgame isn't especially hard to arrive at, but it does require you practice the good habits you've learned along the way. Team work, efficient terrain traversal, and good aim, in a series of longer missions full of double-objectives and heightened enemy spawns. The rewards are Overclocks. Perks ranging from mundane and convenient to lopsided and peculiar. These will either do boring things like increase your ammo - or make your glowing line of plasma spin around like crazy and cut up everything in front of you. They're fun but unnecessary. My advice? Don't treat the endgame like a grind to slog through. Don't look at your upgrades and cosmetics as a checklist. Take the Season as something to nibble on instead of power up.Experience the adventure. Revel in the solid core mechanics which make this an excellent shooter to dive into. Appreciate Deep Rock Galactic for what it is - an honest reprieve from a game genre filled with unrewarding tedium made to wring you of your dollars.;11 April, 2020;

Deep Rock Galactic;Confuzz;NOT INFORMED;911 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Recommended 892.9 hrs on record;In a world full of cash-grab AAA titles and half-baked indie ideas, Deep Rock Galactic exemplifies what can happen when a group of talented and passionate people come together and decide to redefine the industry standard of multiplayer co-op shooters.There is a...heart to this game, and its developers, that becomes immediately apparent once you've spent any amount of time in their universe. A fair amount of collectibles exist merely to be brewed into beer, most of which provide no function beyond being silly and entertaining. Management yells at you to stop kicking around (achievement-related) barrels while in the pre-game lobby. After failing a mission, you respawn in a hospital gown and can choose to embark upon the next mission in that getup instead of your usual colorful raiment. The choice is yours as to whether you pet docile, loot-containing bugs...blow them up...or both! There is a button specifically for yelling nonsensical and camaraderie-inducing voice lines.Beyond all of this lies a surprisingly well-balanced framework for your experience in-game that can be tweaked in a multitude of different ways, catering both to those who enjoy a more casual cooperative experience, as well as those who have a deep-seated masochistic streak! With hundreds of hours' worth of functional content to unlock - and even more cosmetics - this is one of the few titles I would deem truly special, and worth just about everyone's time.If you've friends that play? Hop in, grab a beer both IRL and in-game, and you'll have the time of your life. If you don't, well, DRG's community is one of the most wholesome and entertaining that I've experienced in decades of online gaming.;20 October, 2022;

But in terms of game offering freedom- Even though its on rails player awareness can decline greatly (It feels very predetermined when a player knows where the ball is)- More to the Arcade side (personal preference), It does not simulate the depths of football in terms of ball physics, foot planting, momentum or power, everything is simpler- Can do everything in Stunning variant, which is good and bad looking at realism, only finesse shots cant bedone in stunning style because that becomes a canceled shot. LOL- Breaks all type of logic and momentum and physics override for more video gamey player freedom- Abysmally basic Dream team menu's- Dream team ultra basic, Seems like they just want to start up the coin buying machine- Freedom of choosing what to train on your dream team players. It can be a good thing but at the moment I feel likeit undermines the hunt for amazing players and inviduality. - No 3D grass during freekicks- Net physics feel like they perform at a way lower fps, they are also not detailed- Scoring goals feel very lifeless to me because of this point above, but also because theres just no weight to it, no excellent ball physics- Lack of obviously a lot of modes still, Not even the basic ones are in there, co-op or offline play and all that. -- PC only bad things -- - Controller pickup extremely weird, doesnt pick up my Dualshock 4 in Settings.exe anymore.

I've been with PES since we got the Original for Christmas on PS2. I've been with PES no matter the licenses and wonky player names. I've been through the decline and the new coming. I've seen EA lose it's ambition while PES still tried to make the game better. And I genuinely thought that we surpassed EA already. Until.During all these years i mainly played master league. I've patiently waited Konami to deliver. To fix the annoying things in the game. The AI, animations, repetition. etc. PES 2018 has been tasting just a little old and i was looking forward to upgrading. Until.In the end PES was different than FIFA. And that's why we chose it over licenses, arcade, flash (and addiction). FIFA's novelties were street football and similar half finished arcade articles. In PES we could (usually) wait a better game than before. PES had history. Until.Until... Until this. THis straight up downgrade. Clunky, ugly, unimpressive. An insult. Konami gave EA the title for free and launched a cheap FTP title to flirt with the player base that wants to play a football game but not necessarily pay for it. And it shows. ""Game's not polished"" is a lie. ""It's not finished"" is stretching it. Middle of a wilderness road in pitch black darkness. There you'll find eFootball 2022. You've all seen the pictures. No words, no excuses. The gameplay, the most important part, feels heavy and tired. Some of the new controls are pointless, some just straight up quality of life downgrades. Goals feel hollow. 2 difficulties available. No game modes. Game play feels worse than in an decade. There's no soul. I guess they thought that we'd stick along, silent and loyal?And until this review has become more a rant than anything. i guess this is my goodbye letter. There's no more football games for me.

Been playing since literally Day 1 of public testing. Game developers actually give a ????. Game gets constant updates. Foundation of the game is amazing. Combat is probably seen as wonky to newcomers but it's got charm and style that you'll learn to love even as basic as it is. Content is obviously still being worked on, games still fairly newborn in development. The devs have stated many times they have a 5-10 year plan. Even though the game is hard, it's rare to find one you can just pick up and play with no BS involved. Sometimes they patch something just to revert it to where it was prior, cLassic Ironmace. Game is great, much fun, crazy versatility, you can literally decide you don't want to swing your weapon a single time and just run peoples pockets(pickpocketing) and milk them dry as they extract with literally nothing on because you've been pickpocketing them for the last 10 minutes.

The game has cost $30 since its release on their own platform. I can understand the frustration of expecting a game to be totally free to play when they use that term, but to review bomb a game because you can't access every single feature, because you don't want to make a one time purchase is absurd. There is no battle pass system or anything of the like to monetize the game. Plain and simple you pay up front and you get the game and all the future content to be added. I don't understand what there is to be upset about.People are saying its pay to win. That's false. You are limited to the ""Normal"" gamemode which is limited in gear and makes it the most even playing field in the entire game. You can get out geared in ""Highroller"" matches, but not in ""Normals"".I have 500 hours on their launcher and that is well worth the one time $30 payment for me. The F2P version is a good option for those who want to try out the game and see what the gameplay loop is like, or for casual players who just want to dungeon crawl and fight some other players.My advice: Try out the game. If you don't like it, then that's totally fair, but writing a review because you feel entitled to a completely free game by a smaller studio is whack. The gaming industry has had all expectations changed by corporations like EA and Blizzard making their triple A titles free to play. Don't put these expectations on every studio, especially when that exact marketing tactic is exploited to make games MORE pay to win and cost the consumer MORE money to access all the content down the line.MAKE ONE TIME PAYMENTS THE STANDARD AGAIN.

Warframe;Nofriendo;NOT INFORMED;4,443 people found this review helpful191 people found this review funny; Recommended 615.4 hrs on record;"This story requires a bit of setup.Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a ""Grandmaster"" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked. my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.Flash forward a year. Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session. your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.";21 November, 2014;

Warframe;Avabo;227 products in account;317 people found this review helpful22 people found this review funny; Recommended 940.4 hrs on record;First, good things about Warframe:This game has spoiled me. I will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer. Be it AAA or indie.This game is free. Get it? Free. You are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game. All characters, quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being said, I HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?Now, just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we're talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.What will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.What will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own way, and deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bow, rifle, etc), a secondary weapon (pistol, throwing knives, and... other things), and of course a melee weapon.Now, you can always tear through the game solo, but, for the best experience, the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earth, to an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.But doing missions is just one part of it, you also have a widely explorable open-world area, with its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updates, they are a regular thing. Like, every other day.Now what's the story? Can't tell you. Its a secret. No, really, the game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOW, and then we can talk about it, but until then, you gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.How about difficulty? Scales up with your level, just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casually, there's content for you. If you're looking for a challenge, good news, the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.------------------------------------Now, bad things about warframe:-PVP sucks-Grinding, lots of grinding.-There are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and/or have been in development hell for ages.-Your inventory slots are limited, and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slots, since you can simply sell what you don't need or want, it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum, if you ever do.------------------------------------About grinding. This is both a good and bad thing about the game. Most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it's a little diferent. In Warframe, the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeah, there is a lot of grinding, but you have fun while doing it.------------------------------------Final thoughts.Now, I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade), but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry, and I can only see good things in the future for them.In conclusion, we don't deserve Warframe.Also, you can have a space dog/cat, and PET THEM. 10/10*EDIT: Grammar*;30 August, 2018;

War Thunder;Apollo1641;NOT INFORMED;19,429 people found this review helpful155 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 3,766.0 hrs on record;"I didn't want to leave a negative review, but Gaijin's blatant contempt for their own players has forced my hand.War Thunder is a game like no other, with a comprehensive damage system, combined arms, and variety of beautifully modeled tanks, aircraft and ships. Unfortunately, this ""uniqueness"" has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a ""free to play"" title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn't enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation.For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you'll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle.This isn't just greedy, it also destroys the matchmaker and the balance of the game. Since you only profit using premium vehicles they often end up being spammed. In battlerating 8.7, more than half the players on each team are in premium tanks. This results in rampant ""one death leaving"". These players only spawn their premium tank and leave when it's destroyed, leaving their team in a bad position. Sometimes the premium is their only tank for the tier, othertimes it's because ""free"" tanks aren't worth the high cost to repair.Gaijin and their purposefully frustrating economy is ultimately to blame for this. There's so many other issues and scandals I could bring up, like how you can't repair or extinguish flames on your new tank before unlocking ""parts"" and ""FPE"". Gaijin wants you to pay gold to skip the grind for these essential tools.In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. That might seem hypocritical considering my hours spent in this game, but believe me. It's new players who suffer the most. Gaijin doesn't care about me, you, or the playerbase. Don't make the same mistake as me. Find another game that values your input, and respects your time.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit, July 26: Much has happened since May and the publishing of this review.Most importantly, on 13th of June, Gaijin published a roadmap of planned economy changes. Most recent roadmap update as of this edit: https://warthunder.com/en/news/8374-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-battle-pass-available-in-simulator-battles-enThis was an unprecedented event, as we have never seen this much transparency from the Devs before.Despite tempered expecations and a healthy dose of skepticism on the part of myself and many others, the roadmap is actually progressing according to schedule.One of the key criticisms in my review, that of SL (Silver Lions) has been (largely) adressed, earnings were increased across the board, and repair costs adjusted.All ground vehicles now have a basic version of Parts and FPE available from the start without needing to unlock the Parts and FPE modifications: basic parts can repair components to partial functionality, while basic FPE is single-use.Aircraft with countermeasures now start with a basic flare loadout, while mixed / full countermeasure loadouts require unlocking the flare modification.You no longer have to pay repair cost when teamkilled (finally), and newly purchased premium vehicles now include 15 free backups (extra spawns). Backups are a consumable however, and as such it doesn't fully alleviate the ""one death leaving"" issue, as players will quickly spend their 15 backups and continue this behavior after. Gaijin needs to consider making the backup permament.I don't mean to diminish these changes, they were sorely needed, but there's still a long way to go.As of today, no changes have been made to RP (Research Point) gain, which is the main cause for slow progression, especially in Ground Forces Mode.The matchmaking system desperately needs a major overhaul, and battle ratings need to be decompressed. While matchmaking changes are mentioned in the roadmap, it remains to be seen how Gaijin chooses to handle this issue.All in all, while the changes are positive so far and show a lot of promise going forward, my review will stay unchanged until the roadmap is concluded, and the full effects can be seen.Lastly I want to thank you all so much for your attention and gracious awards! Thanks to you I have amassed just over 2.5 Million Steam Points! That's mind-boggling, I could've never anticipated this much engagement writing my little review back in May. I apologize for the late update, and let's hope for more good news.";18 May, 2023;

How many of them do you think I was actually happy while playing? I will never get that time back.Edit: For the naysayers who've been commenting ""but you've played the game for X hours, you must enjoy it""I used to enjoy the game. I started playing in 2014 when I bought my first ?????? laptop, because I didn't have the ability to play many newer games, and didn't want to spend money on games I couldn't run regardless. I loved the idea of driving around in realistic WW2 era tanks, because I'm a big fan of military history, and even studied it in college. My first hours in Tank Arcade, before I learned what crew skills did, before I learned the subtle nuances of armor types, and calibers, and shell types, etc, I had the most fun I've ever had in video games, playing War Thunder.Like with so many other live service games in this modern age though, I've had to watch a game that I used to love get progressively worse, patch after patch, update after update. I watched the economy move from a F2P model (albeit with a small bit of grinding) to a ""pay to progress at anything more than a snails pace."" To put it into perspective, I unlocked the F-82 within a month of only playing Air Arcade and only F2P using the few boosters the game gave you back when I first started. I started grinding the German air tree this year, and just hit Rank 3 planes last month, WITH premium.Top tier past 7.7 is an absolute atrocious mess. CAS was already strong before, back when 8.0 was top BR, but now, with the addition of AGMs, Drones, Helis, thermals, etc, I die more often to Air vehicles in Tank RB, than I do to actual tanks. And having a bad match at top BR means you have to go back to sub 6.7 for atleast a dozen matches just to recoup your SL losses to continue grinding. The games economy has been absolutely trashed by Gaijin to almost force players to buy premium time, and premium vehicles, just to make profit to save up for higher tier vehicles.So yea, at 2200hrs, I realized I hate this stupid game. But I'll keep playing it until my premium runs out, because I didn't waste money for nothing.Second Edit: Yesterday, May 19th 2023, Gaijin released a community post accusing those of us who have rightful complaints about the games economy being catered only towards those who spend copious amounts of money, as review bombing their game and driving away new players. They simultaneously made excuses for why why they want to keep making the grind in the game even harder for both new and old players. Instead of taking accountability for how they as a company have failed both new and veteran players, they have decided to shift the blame onto the players themselves. This should be a sign to all players, new and old, that Gaijin absolutely does not give a crap about us, and only cares about their potential profits. Please, I beg of you, fellow fans, go find something else to play instead. GHPC is a relatively inexpensive tank sim for the ground RB lovers. DCS world and IL-2 Sturmovik exists for those of you who play air. If Gaijin wants to blame the playerbase for why their game is failing, then lets give them the excuse they've made, and leave.Third Edit: If you're gonna use my review for your Youtube video or gaming article (Here's looking at you PC Gamer) atleast use the full review instead of picking and choosing sentences to confirm your own bias.Fourth Edit Post Economy ""Update"": Once again Gaijin has gaslighted and lied to the community. The changes we got were the absolute bare minimum, with base SL gains across the board being nerfed, so that SL modifiers, despite being increased on paper, actually give equal or even less SL than before. Repair costs for the most exorbitant vehicles were lowered, but vehicles with average or below average repair costs for their tier weren't touched, or were slightly increased. The first tank I noticed was the BTR-80A as I've spent the past 3 days grinding it. It went from 3.5k yesterday with some modifications (I haven't spaded it yet) to over 3.8k today with the same modifications. While a 300ish SL increase may not seem like much, thats only for one tank in a lineup of 5. Several premium vehicles had their repair costs increased as well, like the IS-6. Without premium, in a 7.0 Russian lineup, 5 kills and 4 assists with 4 deaths net me a -3.2k SL loss despite using a premium tank in that lineup. So yea, its all been a big sham";6 May, 2023;

And I do mean break even. Because of previous economy changes, you're heavily punished for losing but only slightly rewarded for winning in terms of post-game SL and Research Points, you typically lose lions unless you're using a premium account.To the old heads,""Get gud then scrub"" ""I win lots, so it doesn't affect me.""A game's base economy shouldn't punish the people who perform poorly, which is the MAJORITY of the playerbase. It's pure greed that made them realize that since most games are carried by a few top performers they can milk the majority of the playerbase for premium just to be able to stay afloat.

Smite is not the problem, it's a good game. Hi-Rez is the issue.If you enjoy basically non-existent lore, cash-grabs and rigged systems, cancerous matchmaking, unbalanced and clearly developer-favored characters, bugs aplenty, one completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatch's community, Smite is your game.Back when I started playing, Smite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years. It was diverse, set itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps. It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted. But then Hi-Rez published it's first chests. There were only 2 exclusive skins, but they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system. In the following years, 95% of all new skins were exclusive or limited - put in cash-grab events or chests. There was a time where there wasn't a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months. To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skins, all of them exclusive.Let's put this into perspective: There are literally 128 types of chests in this game. They range from 200gems to 400gems, so about 3,20€ to 6,40€ respectively, per roll. As a new player, you have 0/55 items from the Curiosity Chest. Each roll costs 3,20€. The chests are also rigged, not joking here, which means you'll get the skin at ~53/55, which puts you at a staggering 170€ just to get that one skin you wanted. And every single season, the grande finale of cash grabs, the so called ""odyssey"". Smite teases one ""Tier5 skin"", a skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design. It's comparable to LoL's ultimate skins, which cost about 20€. The only issue here is, that you can't directly buy the skin. You have to get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably don't even want for that one T5 skin that's barely worth 20 bucks. You'll lose about 100€, if not more, in this great ""odyssey"", as Hi-Rez likes to title it. The odyssey is also often accompanied by several ""adventures"". Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters. The catch is, this map doesn't change, the map always remains the same, and all rewards are either locked behind a paywall (who would have guessed) or a tedious grind-fest that'll probably take millions of your brain cells and about 2 weeks of your life. I'm not even going to talk about the recent ""adventure"", because that's just a pure joke.Now, bugs. Smite suffers from so many bugs, many of which are present since closed beta. Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking it's honestly a joke that they're not fixed yet. First off, In 99% of all matches, lobby chat just doesn't work. It won't even appear in your chat box. You can't communicate with your teammates while you pick your gods. Second, also in 99% of all matches, one or more gods won't load in your stats screen. Which basically means, that, if you press TAB, it won't list that particular god. You can't see their items (which in turn means you don't know how to build against them), you can't see their relics, not even their score. Their kills";25 August, 2018;

Albion Online;Payne;NOT INFORMED;600 people found this review helpful26 people found this review funny; Recommended 274.3 hrs on record;"I'm going to recommend this game but I'm doing so very reluctantly. Last night was the last time I logged in because I decided to quit the game after playing for around 1.5 months.I went into this game knowing very little about it. All I heard was ""played driven economy"" and ""everything is crafted by the player"" which sounded like a huge appeal. The PvP element became very obvious to me early on. Now, to anyone reading this, Albion Online is a game made around PvP. PvP is its heart no matter what anyone else gonna tell you. Even if you want to steer clear from PvP and focus only on gathering/refining/crafting you STILL have to deal with PvP in terms of gankers.Gankers is the reason I decided to leave the game. I'm not much into PvP though I tried to get involved during my time in there. The game is fantastic with its gathering and crafting system. For me it was rubbing an itch in an unexpected manner. I was looking forward to improve my character to craft higher tier items and make a living as some sort of artisan-trader in-game.I'm going to describe the event that lead to me quitting and I'll try to use layman terms so that people who haven't played the game will get a general idea of what happened.I gather animal hides from a PvP zone (Black Zone). The reason I do that in the PvP zone is because that level of Hides you'd only get in these type of zone. There's a hideout where I was stashing all my hides. I've amass one week worth of hides and decided to move that stash to the royal city (safe city hub). As usual, I took whichever path I thought was the safest. 10+ gankers showed up out of nowhere and melted my mount (T6 Ox) within second and killed me. My gear and my loot was worth around 1.5m silver (for anyone playing the game for around 1.5 months, that's a big amount of silver). It was disheartening, I was quite annoyed at first but a few hours later I left it behind me.Fast forward later that day. I have multiple farms. I use my farms to plant herbs then I use those herbs to craft Poison. Poison is an item used in PvE/PvP contents. So, on a daily basis I gather my herbs and then craft potion. Afterward I would move to a Royal City to sell my potion. I gathered my herd. I crafted my potion. I was on my way to the royal city. Once more, took what I thought was going to be a safe route (again, not the same everyday). When I was literally a few feet from the entrance of a safe zone, 10+ people showed up from nowhere again and ganked me. Effectively looting me from another 1.5m silver worth of equipment and potion.At this point, I was completely crushed. Now, while I lost 3m silver and for most people who are just starting out it would be a huge lost... for me it was a huge lost which I knew I could come back from. From day 1 of playing this game I've been super optimal in what I do and would always look for the best way to invest my silver to build a steady stream of revenue. I knew the lost silver probably represent 5% - 6% of what I'd possibly make in one month or even less if I scale the stuff I do... BUT... I just don't want to deal with this anymore. The negative feeling I got in that moment, the mood shifting from happy crafter to depressed because of a silly game and virtual currency... Nah, this is not for me, I don't want to deal with that.One thing you should know is that gankers will always have the upper hand in this game. Gankers are always going to look for weak target. A weak target is a trader who is just starting to get some success but not quite there yet... meaning the trader is always traveling with equipment that are weak (not in a fighting condition) and/or mount that are slow (can't outrun the enemy). Traders (gatherers/crafters) are easy target and getting ganked is there daily life. A solo trader have almost no protection against gank. Against 1 ganker, you're probably safe. Against 2, it could be hectic if your mount is weak. Against 3, the chance of escape starts to become slim but its there. Against 4, you might get super lucky (or they're awfully dumb as a rock). Against 5? Against TEN? Nah, just stand there and accept your fate.Ganking is part of that PvP element. There's no removing it. Any suggestion to facilitate the life of traders will be met with harsh criticism from various parties. The game has one of the best gathering and crafting system out there but its weighed down heavily with ganking. There's almost no joy in gathering at higher level. you're constantly under stress of getting ganked. The only temporary joy is when you go to your hideout to hide your stash but you're still facing the anxiety of bringing that load back to the royal city. You might get start and hire a Scout to get you a clear path but at this point, what you're paying the scout might negate any revenue you'd make gathering early on.What happened to me is not a tragedy, its just part of the cycle. My wall of text is not a big sign telling you to go back, its just a stern warning of what you're getting into.If you are the type of player who enjoys PvP then go right ahead, you're gonna find a great amount of joy in this game. People who wants to steer clear from PvP? You can't. Full stop.Again, I'm still giving this a recommend because the game is good. The system works as intended. Just keep in mind that PvP is the core of this game and there's no escaping from this.";1 March, 2021;

Choose your class from long range, melee, and magic.Deeper into the game, the player will be able to pick a specific line as a shield, support, healer, archer, swordsman, tank, scout, and so much more.The Game of The PlayAlbion Online is a bird-view MMORPG fantasy sandbox game. Featuring a large selection of crafting, combat styles, large selection of mounts, and learning tiers.For example, the player needs to level up a skill to eventually use learning points to unlock that tier. Some tiers give access to crafting the items, and others give access to equipping them. Go on quests for the royale kingdom or small quests exploring the lands in parties or alone. Explore the snowy mountains, the deep forests, or the blistering savanna. The deeper you go, the higher-tier resources, but also the higher-tier creatures.And to gather these higher-tier recourses, the player needs better gathering tools, which require recourses that the player can gather with their current-tier recourse tools. It will take some leveling up before being available to unlock a new skill tier to be able to both craft and equip the crafted item to go deeper into the island with friends or strangers and see what the island has prepared for your arrival.Destiny BoardThe destiny board is like a skill tree, but instead of new skills, it unlocks new craftable & equippable items.The standard skills that the player needs to unlock to proceed with the larger variety of weapons, armor, and tools are:Journeyman AdventurerTrainee FighterTrainee TrackerTrainee FarmerTrainee GathererTrainee Craftsman To level up each category, you’d either have to eliminate creatures with the specified weapon or craft the weapon/tools tier (to level up so you can craft better weapon/tools).Hot BarThe hot bar contains of 10 selectable slots, each as follows:MountsThe first bar, which by standard is selected by (1), which I changed to (X).It gives easy access to get on your mount while near it or spawns your mount if despawned. Or entered a new zone while not mounted on it.CombatThe second, third, and forth slots are fighting abilities. The first two are damage abilities. they have their own special moves and are meant to deal damage to enemies.The third is a buff ability that buffs up the weapon, for example, the bow. It will shoot three arrows at a faster speed for a short amount of time.With stronger weapons, it will unlock more selectable abilities, which the player can then choose from.SpellsSlots five, six, and seven are supporting spells. Each armor piece has different selectable spells, depending on the class and armor tier, the spells can be different.The headgear is for magical use, the chest piece is for healing, and the boots are for agility. Each armor piece also has a hidden powerup, which grants the player a small perk.Perks are selected from the available unlocked perks on the armor piece.Potion & ConsumablesSlots eight and nine are for potions and consumables, aka food. These selected items can be equipped onto the bar in the inventory, where they have their own specified slots.OverchargeInfo the game gives the player:Pushes your gear magically over its limits at the risk of breaking it. Grants an additional 100 Item Power for 30 minutes, but after the Overcharge ends, there is a 15% chance the gear will break and be permanently destroyed.ChatIn chat, the player can add and remove filters such as chat global, chat for nearby players, chat for a specific language, or chat say, which makes a talk bubble above the player, allowing them to communicate with other players that come around.PvPvEOn the island, in towns, there are arenas where two players can battle over items, a price, or simply fame.Some areas will have PvP active, so any player can be killed or kill another player who is within this terrain area.It’s called “Yellow Zones,"" and the game will always warn you before entering the yellow zone.Visual & AudioVisualsThe game is based on a bird-view perspective and has a lot of small detailing, for example, trader/crafter huts (which are all different depending on their location/city), shops, terrain, and mounts, along with much more.The game looks quite good for the quality, 3D animation style, and build-up. And all for being a multiplatform online game that is free. More into special attacks since there are quite a few selections of a large variety of weapons and fighting styles that bring different power attacks or specialized moves with the equipped weapon.AnimationsDuring my time playing, I chose to go with a bow, which gave me one locked special move and another where I could choose one out of two specialized moves. In total, I had two specialized moves, one buff and a normal attack.And each specialized move has its own animation, which is my point here. The vast variety of weapons, which all have their own specialized move animation.When it comes to how clean or smooth the animations are, the devs did a really good job on this game. All the animations during specialized attacks, running, riding mounts, and a lot more of moving activity run beautifully.AudioWhen the player is in a town/city, they will hear sounds of the shopkeepers chittering n chattering while moving their tools and working. As well as fellow players riding their mounts through the town roads.Once entered a biome, the background music will kick in. Depending on the biome, the music and sounds can be different.For example, in a classical forest, the player will hear birds chittering and flying. Hearing the wind blowing through the trees and the wild animals or creatures that bestow within the forest.The background music doesn’t last very long after entering a town or biome. It lasts a few seconds and then fades away, leaving the background sounds to play.Overall, both the short music and the sounds are all very good, and they all fit perfectly. Small note: The game does also have a day and night cycle, switching from day to night, and at night the creatures or animals in the biomes lay down and rest.Pros and ConsProsGameplayAudioGraphics & AnimationsLarge variety of weapon selectionLarge variety of mount selectionDestiny board systemConsShort musicFighting (On PC)Destiny board zoom scaleMy final little thoughtsAlbion is a multiplatform online PvPvE game that brings together mobile players and PC players. Meet new people, group up in a party, and explore the world or dungeons together.For being a free game, it is very enjoyable and contains a lot of content. After years of looking for players, there is finally a game for both mobile players and PC player, a game that doesn’t take a lot of battery or a game that doesn’t pop up an ad every five minutes.I highly recommend this game for anyone and their friends to try it out. If you ever get tired of any kind of game and want to try something that is free but also known to be enjoyable with a lot of content to it. Then the search is no longer my friend.Join the world of Albion and see what it brings. Nothing but good, I’m sure of it.Rating: 9/10Welcome to Resort Albion. everyone is just dying to get here!"; 9 February ;

A lot of criticisms still hold up, but quite a bunch of them have been fixed. Now there are objectives that encourage small-scale PvP (like, 5-15 people in a group), added a bunch of quality of life changes, and made the game more enjoyable even if you don't have 20+ people. It's still NOT a PvE game, politics still suck, but I think it did become better. If there was a ""maybe recommend"" option, I'd go with that. Still, I feel like most people who read this review would not enjoy the game, so I'll leave it at ""not recommended"".Ok, let me start with this: if you want to PvE, do NOT pick this game up! Most PvE content is really boring, and the fun stuff (the Avalonian stuff) is all in full-loot PvP areas infested with people who want your gear, ruining the fun of PvE. I wouldn't give a thumbs down for this tho, since the game is not really focused on PvE (although there would be potential for that too, real shame for it).The combat system is functional. That's the best way to describe it. You're never gonna feel amazing purely because of the system, but it works well. Now the bad part comes: there's no fun in it. Absolutely none. Since the game is PvP focused, if a build with a unique idea comes up, you can bet your soul it's gonna be nerfed or deleted. Forget your creativity if you're trying to make builds, just follow the meta, cause the developers are actively working against interesting builds. This is one of the reasons I'm giving the thumbs down. I love theorycrafting.And now about the main focus of the game: PvP. Theres a lot of PvP content, but honestly, only the open world PvP is worth mentioning, as the others (1v1, 2v2, 5v5 hellgates or arenas) are decent, but there are games that focus on these types of matches and are a lot better at it. If you think these gamemodes are fun, just pick up a MOBA or a brawler (League, Dota2, SMITE, Battlerite, etc..), they have better fleshed out gameplay and are fair, not gear-dependent. Well, I guess I can recommend it if you want a watered-down MOBA that you can pay and grind to win. Not saying there's no skill involved, there definitely is, just not as much as other games.Also, small-scale open-world PvP is fun if you're a griefer. That's it. It's all about ruining other people's fun. You go in with better gear";11 April, 2021;
Albion Online;A;NOT INFORMED;573 people found this review helpful16 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 0.1 hrs on record;Founder Since Beta 1, aka the glory days..Removing content like grottos, nested portal dungeons, harbor towns, black zone cities, etc. really hurt the direction of the game IMO. SBI became obsessed with their consensual/non-consensual pvp and forgot to focus on developing their sandbox elements. PvP is looked down upon in yellow and red zones, and gaining a negative rep has no redeemable qualities. It takes weeks, if not months to reverse what rep damage you can do in a single day.

V Rising;lot.;NOT INFORMED;526 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 60.0 hrs on record;Speaking from playing both On My Own, and With Friends, here is my review: I have clocked in roughly 15 hours in PvE solo (I found a server that had rules set up to protect against griefing), and I personally found it enjoyable, even without the presence of others. None of my friends had the game during this time frame.During this time, I figured out the mechanics of the game alone and found a great deal of pleasure figuring out things on my own and exploring the world. Though the world is not infinite, it is still rather vast compared to you walking, sprinting, or shapeshifting into a wolf and traversing by those means. As I have seen some other reviews say, it is true: the map is littered with many bandit camps and things of the like, so it never feels empty or lifeless while you are traveling. Though I must say, flame archers do hurt.;27 May, 2022;
V Rising;layout;NOT INFORMED;258 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 208.0 hrs on record;First of all, a couple things about my playthrough:- Solo, with some tweaks to the server settings to make it less grindy (boosted gather rate, refinement rate, things like that).- Reached Dunley Farmlands / Iron Gear so far.- Dipped my toe into multiplayer, didn't bother with the official servers.The Positives: Great gothic art style. PvE Combat is fun and challenging, especially with large groups of mobs. Weapon fighting styles feel unique and lend themselves to different tactics. Spells are fairly diverse. Interior decorating. Plethora of server setting options to customize the experience and lessen the grind for solo play, if so desired. Castle layout changes are mostly fairly easy, especially when you set the resource return rate to 100% (because I'm gonna reorganize my castle design and NO, I will NOT grind for it!). Free movement of objects in your castle is a god-send. Some bosses are thrilling, nail-biting affairs with near-misses and clutch moments abound. (Bright Archer, Bandit King) The sense of humor. The Negatives : Otherwise smooth framerate punctuated by relatively long (~0.5-1 sec) periods of stuttering, even on Medium settings.;7 June, 2022;
V Rising;Suaro;NOT INFORMED;499 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 133.7 hrs on record;Great game that's worth the price. Your progression is based almost entirely on bosses. Want to start collecting iron? Time to go kill the boss that allows you to start smelting iron. Not only that, but the boss also gives you an ability you can use. The base building is awesome, the combat feels great, and the overall aesthetic is really appealing.The only negatives for this game are:- Pacing is really great until you're about 15-20 hours in and things become quite a bit Grindy.- Things take real-life time to be completed. Converting a villager into a vampire spawn? Okay, it will take you 5 hours. This can be changed in your own custom server if you wish- PVP can be a negative for some people, especially since progression is based around the bosses you need to fight. The bosses are in the open world and therefore, are free game for anyone. It can be annoying when a really high level player is in the beginner zones farming resources, because they'll just kill you while you're trying to kill a boss. It can be very frustrating. However, there are also PVE servers if you aren't a fan of PVP. I personally enjoy PVP, but I can see how it might be a negative for others; 14 April Ea;

V Rising;toastypoast;185 products in account;270 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 112.5 hrs on record;"The central gameplay loop of V Rising is pretty interesting and satisfying: acquire resources, upgrade your gear and castle, hunt new bosses to unlock new spells, abilities, forms, and recipes, and repeat. If you're willing to tolerate a grind or want to play offline with custom settings that reduce the grind, you'll enjoy the gameplay. Some have likened it to Diablo or PoE. Given that it's WASD, I'm not sure I really see the comparison-- the combat is a little more technical and skillful than most ARPGs. The bosses usually require good timing and footwork and a focus on mitigating your own greed if you're properly/under-leveled. It's more like a Hades or Heroes of Hammerwatch type game minus the roguelike run-based upgrades. You have abilities on cooldown, like D2 or D3, but precision and timing matter, unlike D2, D3, or the first 90 hours of PoE. I love D2, but the difficulty is much more gear-based than skill-based. Most of my buddies are struggling with the late game bosses while gently overleveled. The first several bosses will be rather easy if you're familiar with Dark Souls type patience, but the latter bosses become genuinely interesting and require some practice and planning to take down. They're easily the best part of the game.V Rising is entertaining, but you need to understand that a given playthrough (in online or on default server settings) is 90% grind and 10% gameplay.The first 10 hours of a playthrough communicate this poorly: they're consistently fun. You're upgrading your gear and abilities with solid pacing, and it takes an hour or less to acquire the resources you need to upgrade that gear once you unlock the needed recipes. Each time you acquire a new ability, it's fairly likely you'll feel significantly more powerful and more able to collect the resources you like without worrying about the ads guarding them. The most frustrating grind during this stage of play is acquiring enough stone and wood to wall in your castle to maintain a decent little workshop while keeping out the sunlight. Eventually, each tier upgrade for loot is much grindier than this.Once you're about 20 hours in, you have some of, if not THE, best abilities in the game. Bosses, at that point, essentially only guard recipes. Once you get to the second-to-last tier of weapons and armor, the resource grind slows to a halt. You have to run the most efficient routes for hours to outfit yourself, much less a team. The novelty and excitement of getting what were previously rare items totally fades by the time you finally get a tiny stat upgrade. Most of my friends lost interest here, and I was left playing the game largely solo. It's fair to say that a good number of people that would have enjoyed this game if it were setup like a roguelike became sick of the grind:boss fight ratio. When the progression still feels fun, the bosses will be a bit underwhelming. When the bosses start getting fun, the progression feels underwhelming (grind! Are you tallying how many times I've said the word yet?).I think that grindy games are fun if you spend no more than half of your playtime grinding, and if that grinding presents varied areas, enemies, and experiences that are roughly equally viable. This isn't that. There's often 1 or 2 areas that are by far the best for acquiring your most needed resource, leading either to boring repetitiveness or acceptance of subpar farming routes in a game that demands a bunch of farming. The scourgestone/dark silver grind is really frustrating, especially because the end game forge requires the equivalent of 3 tool's/weapon's worth of it before you can actually make the tools/weapons. You'll run the Haunted Forest and Dunley Monastery a dozen times to get what you need. You'll be able to farm these areas like the back of your hand. The challenge, novelty, and intrigue will be gone.On the business side, it seems Stunlock isn't really to be trusted as a developer, either. They've abandoned 2 different Early Access titles already, and they've added expensive ""supporter"" DLCs to this game without having released a major update in 10 months. This is good news in that old guides still apply if you're looking to learn the optimal routes and strategies in this game. This is bad news if you're expecting this game to become much more than it already is. At the very least, this game is already well worth $20 as it stands.Pros:-Satisfying combat with gradually more challenging bosses-Good upgrade system tied to gear instead of XP (somebody else can grind for you if you don't have time and just wanna do the fun parts)-Starts out feeling like a Souls title in combat-Ends up making you feel incredibly powerful with proper cooldown management in combat-New animal forms to help you navigate the map-Castle offers more and more functionality-Lets you run your own server with custom settings to tweak resource and combat difficulty-Servants can farm a little for you while you're offlineCons:-While you do unlock new mechanics to mitigate grind, perfectly using all of them still leaves you feeling slower to acquire resources than you were in the first 10 hours-Eventually, entire play sessions will be spent grinding. Is the combat fun enough for you to offset this?-Unlikely to receive many major updates-If your friends are reasonable, responsible, employed adults, they'll lose interest-Bosses are much more fun solo than with friends even though this is a multiplayer-focused game-Can't fast travel while carrying anything important, and you'll travel to the same areas over and over and over. Game would still be painfully grindy if you could fast travel anywhere you wanted anytime you wanted, so it adds insult to injury.-Game promises you a bat form only to reveal you can't use it while carrying anything important, making it worse than the teleportation network available at the beginning of the game in most scenarios-Failing to plan around the day/night cycle can result in boss/grinding attempts interrupted or postponed-Have to log on consistently to make the most of your servants-Ideal castle locations will be overcrowded on online. You'll have to build yours in butthole town, approximately seven years from all your ideal farming spots.My suggestion? Pick this game up. The best moments are too entertaining to pass up what it already offers for $20. But don't play online. Play a private server with custom settings with friends or solo. Make resources twice as abundant and recipes half as expensive (Honestly? Maybe even make recipes a third or fourth as expensive). Don't touch combat difficulty (make it harder if you're on a 2nd playthrough or perfectionistic: some of these bosses are so well-designed that they're worth learning to no-hit). Enable the fast travel network to be always active, even if you're carrying ""cannot be teleported"" items (maybe put this one off for a second playthrough if you love the feeling of exploration). If you really must play it in its full, grindy glory, your second playthrough will always be waiting for you.";27 March, 2023;

Magic: The Gathering Arena;Armageddon;NOT INFORMED;351 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 230.1 hrs on record;"MTG is hands down one of the greatest card games ever created(but it hasn't been doing so well lately.) I installed the Steam version just long enough to give a review for those that happen to find this, but I have probably around 1K hours in MTG Arena played lifetime. I had even more hours in Magic Online, and a zillion times that IRL, haha! Regardless I'll stick to just talking about MTG Arena since that is what I am reviewing here:I've been playing since Beta and used to be a regular PT grinder. While the glory days are long behind us MTG Arena gives us a simple way to play from home or our mobile devices. The smooth looking playing field, and things all happen easily and automatically. Despite this I really can't recommend MTG Arena as it's way too predatory, expensive, grindy, and somewhat rigged. (I explain this towards the end.)-Unbelievably expensive if you aren't already a top tier player who has at least a few hours a day to grind out a draft or two(assuming you even like drafting, which luckily I do.) I can't imagine what a new player is expected to dole out to attempt to enjoy anything here without being slaughtered by those who play all day or spent thousands.-Grinding out ""win"" quests takes forever for a menial gold reward.-Modern crossover sets aren't as interesting as older sets that take place in the MTG universe. A crutch and a constant cash grab are now a permanent part of the game. Not every cross over will be interesting or mesh at all with the previous one.-The game suffers from brutal power-creep and the more modern value-creep. This is what basically killed standard.-Getting a high rank just means you get a few extra free booster packs at the end of the month. Big whoop!-Best of one is a lame way to play the game, and basically overly rewards playing aggro and going first. Most formats are best of one.-No social engagement at all. Every opponent is just some random screen name with an avatar and a pet you've seen 100 times. Where is ""the gathering"" part!?-Can't play any custom rule sets or any way you want. For example once Pauper is gone, it's gone until they decide to bring it back.Now the final issue: The ""rigged"" factor.A lot of people complain by saying it's ""rigged"" but they never exactly explain HOW it's rigged. It's mostly just people who recognize something is very off with MTG Arena compared to Magic Online or IRL magic. This is interesting, because the other online Magic the Gathering game doesn't have this issue! Magic Online is very old and plays like old accounting software where the economy is ruined(I mean run) by bots. (Don't play MODO either, it sucks in a whole other way, although it is a zillion times less expensive.)The problem here is understanding how it's ""rigged"" and why this manifests itself in such a way. To understand this we must understand how MTG Arena works:(Note: Every claim here is substantiated by Wizards themselves via Twitter etc.)-You must understand how EOMM match making works. A 50% win/loss ratio is scientifically proven to cause higher consistent player retention and therefore create more possible revenue. Also consider increased time played increases the sunken cost fallacy of time spent on the game which therefore causes players to stick to just the game they spent the most money on. EOMM basically works on the same principle that the ""near miss"" trick that carnival games use, or those ""snip the wire, or stack the blocks"" arcade type games. Near misses cause retention to try one more time since you were ""oh so close!""-If you win a lot it will try to adjust your win rate by making you go second more often. On my quest for rank 1 mythic, when I finally achieved this I was going first around ~36% of the time.-It tracks ""deck strength"" and tries to match you up against a deck of similar ""strength"", but this is very subjective and once you get ""bubbled"" as ""Good against Mono Red"" you'll NEVER play against that deck again. You never want to get ""bubbled"" as ""Bad against X"" since that's where you will get matched up with and you will need to adjust to cover your weakness. The best decks therefore either have low ""apparent"" deck strength, but high ""actual"" deck strength, or are adaptable to various scenarios. (For example, it doesn't consider your sideboard for upfront deck strength so ""wishing"" for cards in your sideboard gets around the deck based portion of the upfront deck strength calculation. Just keep in mind you will still get ""bubbled"" ""good against deck X"" if you beat the same deck over and over.)-When playing draft make sure to also consider which cards the game considers ""high deck strength cards"" probably based on that cards win rate across all draft decks it's in. So a somewhat powerful rare/mythic creature that is splashable in your deck may not be worth taking since your deck strength will increase significantly which will in turn increase the average power level of decks you'll be matched up against(and they will also likely have just as many rares or mythic rares as you do!) Since you can't guarantee you will draw that card every game to combat this, it often times makes it not worth it to take! Instead consider a common or uncommon that is also powerful, but keeps your draft deck as ""low deck strength"" as possible. You also have to consider how often other people draft a card and actually win with it. There are a lot of undervalued rare/mythic cards that are good, but people never play them and don't actually win with them. therefore, they actually have low deck strength. Abusing this knowledge leads to much easier and consistent wins... which leads me to my final section of this review:Now you know the rules(and so do I.) How to use all this to your advantage:-Make sure you build decks that go second well and mulligan well once you're deep in going second almost every game territory. Consistency becomes key! If your opponent always goes first but has to mulligan it's no longer a default ""~60%-~40%"" in their favor! For draft this means defensive cards for the early game, and card draw becomes more valuable for the decks you play. As well as cards that can ""turn around"" a game!-Consider whether a card is worth taking not only for how good it is, but consider how much it will increase your upfront deck strength value. No reason to take a card that you'll draw a few games to be forced to play against better decks EVERY game!-In constructed including certain ""hoser/hate"" cards can altogether stop certain match-ups from appearing. This is insanely effective if they are main deck, but you can be tricky and get them from outside the game(wishes) since the upfront deck strength does not see cards in your sideboard. You can then alter your sideboard once those decks stop appearing and focus on the match ups you are now seeing!-Keep track of which decks you play, and what ""bubbles"" MTG Arena has likely marked on those decks. Does your mono white deck stop mono red? Make sure to note it likely has ""Good against red/mono red decks"" meaning you can focus alterations to it towards other decks.-Regardless of all this in best of one aggro is still king. A smooth well balanced ""secretly"" low deck strength aggro deck will always come out a winner over every other deck archetype.Finally, always remember:-Skill still matters. I can't tell you how many games people ""should"" have won, but they just screw it all up and lose. Every draft of MTG Arena I win at least one game where I should of been dead years ago, but they just keep making mistakes until I win(even in the higher ranks.)I hope this review was worth your time to read! Go on and adventure forth! I recommend playing Magic the Gathering in real life with friends as that is the best way to play the game, and feel free to play the format or way YOU want! MTG Arena will never fulfill any of that unfortunately. MTG Arena is essentially Yawgmoth if the only thing he craved was the money in your wallet.";31 October, 2023;

Overwatch® 2;ahdok;NOT INFORMED;11,010 people found this review helpful203 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 0.3 hrs on record;"Alright, let's actually provide a constructive review. Why are people ""review bombing"" Overwatch 2?We paid for Overwatch, we supported it throughout its lifespan, it was popular and liked by its community, and turning a happy profit each year. When Blizzard announced Overwatch 2, the big new feature they announced, the entire premise that made it ""worth the sequel treatment"" was the PvE campaign mode. Hero talent trees, customizable abilities, an expansive co-op campaign that would add to the story and lore. We were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldn't be putting out updates for Overwatch any more, they were re-allocating the staff to work on this new project.With no updates, and no content, Overwatch started to get stale... people grew tired and bored, spending less time in the game, or moving on. Many of us stuck with the product, playing a little each week just to keep fresh... waiting for the new campaign mode. For a lot of us, playing became a chore, something we were doing out of habit, so we'd be ready for the new campaign...But the new campaign wasn't the premise that established OW2, it was the pretext. It was a lie. Blizzard abandoned the PvE campaign a full YEAR before OW2 launched - but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature. It's even in the announcement trailer for OW2, and on the roadmaps. They knew they'd canned it 12 months earlier, but they knew that's what people wanted, so kept putting it front and centre to get people's money, to get people to buy into the project. They took our trust and monetized it.-----What does OW2 ACTUALLY offer then? What did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldn't make content for OW1, the product people paid for and were supporting?1) They overhauled the graphical engine:Before, Overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer, and it'd be smooth. Now, it stutters and stammers in the menus. They've added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world, heroes and environment alike - so where before, heros would ""pop"" against the background and be easy to follow, now everything has the same texture to it, and it all merges together into visual noise - especially at longer ranges. They've compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions, that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos. A PvP game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what you're looking at, so you can react and compete, and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off... meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled.The new engine also has a weird slippery ""feel"" to it. Reviewers who'd played Overwatch for 50 hours came into Overwatch 2 and reported ""look! it's the same Overwatch you love, but it's F2P now! Just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free!"" Established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously ""feel"" like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing, and they didn't understand why. All the timings are messed up.2) They reworked most of the heroes:TLDR: they screwed up the game balance. Previously, one of the biggest appeals of Overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style, and main them, getting good at whatever suited you best. Some people like sniping, or hitscan run and gun, some people aren't good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning, tactics and strategy. You could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy, and paying attention to your surroundings, and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference. With Overwatch 2, the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily. Now, the one tank on the team is insanely chunky, and it's near impossible to kill them quickly - with healer support, they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh. Everyone else dies almost immediately, regardless of who their aggressor is. Team-fighting now is very one-note, you have one tank who's immortal if they have support, and you have four hitscan DPS characters following them - there's not a lot of difference between supports and DPS characters. The teams try to pick off the other team's DPS/Support characters, and when they pick a few off, they can finish the tank and take the objective. Repeat.

Overwatch® 2;?Valiant;NOT INFORMED;7,888 people found this review helpful129 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 0.1 hrs on record;"Alright, let's actually provide a constructive review. Why are people ""review bombing"" Overwatch 2?We paid for Overwatch, we supported it throughout its lifespan, it was popular and liked by its community, and turning a happy profit each year.When Blizzard announced Overwatch 2, the big new feature they announced, the entire premise that made it ""worth the sequel treatment"" was the PvE campaign mode. Hero talent trees, customizable abilities, an expansive co-op campaign that would add to the story and lore. We were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldn't be putting out updates for Overwatch any more, they were re-allocating the staff to work on this new project.With no updates, and no content, Overwatch started to get stale... people grew tired and bored, spending less time in the game, or moving on. Many of us stuck with the product, playing a little each week just to keep fresh... waiting for the new campaign mode. For a lot of us, playing became a chore, something we were doing out of habit, so we'd be ready for the new campaign...But the new campaign wasn't the premise that established OW2, it was the pretext. It was a lie. Blizzard abandoned the PvE campaign a full YEAR before OW2 launched - but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature. It's even in the announcement trailer for OW2, and on the roadmaps. They knew they'd canned it 12 months earlier, but they knew that's what people wanted, so kept putting it front and centre to get people's money, to get people to buy into the project. They took our trust and monetized it.-----What does OW2 ACTUALLY offer then? What did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldn't make content for OW1, the product people paid for and were supporting?1) They overhauled the graphical engine:Before, Overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer, and it'd be smooth. Now, it stutters and stammers in the menus. They've added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world, heroes and environment alike - so where before, heros would ""pop"" against the background and be easy to follow, now everything has the same texture to it, and it all merges together into visual noise - especially at longer ranges. They've compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions, that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos. A PvP game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what you're looking at, so you can react and compete, and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off... meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled.The new engine also has a weird slippery ""feel"" to it. Reviewers who'd played Overwatch for 50 hours came into Overwatch 2 and reported ""look! it's the same Overwatch you love, but it's F2P now! Just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free!"" Established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously ""feel"" like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing, and they didn't understand why. All the timings are messed up.2) They reworked most of the heroes:TLDR: they screwed up the game balance. Previously, one of the biggest appeals of Overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style, and main them, getting good at whatever suited you best. Some people like sniping, or hitscan run and gun, some people aren't good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning, tactics and strategy. You could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy, and paying attention to your surroundings, and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference.With Overwatch 2, the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily. Now, the one tank on the team is insanely chunky, and it's near impossible to kill them quickly - with healer support, they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh. Everyone else dies almost immediately, regardless of who their aggressor is.Team-fighting now is very one-note, you have one tank who's immortal if they have support, and you have four hitscan DPS characters following them - there's not a lot of difference between supports and DPS characters. The teams try to pick off the other team's DPS/Support characters, and when they pick a few off, they can finish the tank and take the objective. Repeat. There's no room for variation in play style at all, you either play a DPS and try to kill the other team DPS, or you play a tank, and try to position correctly - maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you.I understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels, where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights, they wanted the game to feel more like other FPS games - but for a large portion of Overwatch's playerbase specifically, the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter.3.

Hunt: Showdown;Cpt.;NOT INFORMED;811 people found this review helpful204 people found this review funny; Recommended 4,622.7 hrs on record;I have played the game for nearly 800 hours, and man I am bad at it. But that doesn't keep me from playing, because it's awesome. I have read a lot of complaints about campers, so let me assure you, I am one of those campers. Hunt: Showdown allows for many a play style, like rushing in with a shotgun, duelling with pistols, or sniping from far away. There are at least a dozen weapons which allow a sniper playstyle, so don't complain about it. I have played computer games for nearly 40 years now, I'm 55, and I cannot (and would not want to) compete with the Fortnight Kiddies (like my sons...).So I will continue playing, I will continue sniping, and I will desperately try to push my KD past 0.60 - a task of herculean dimensions.Update: I have to correct myself - I'm not a camper, I'm a sniper. I run around, I follow the bounty carriers, I try to get into a favorable position, and then try to shoot them from a safe distance... but all the time I get shot by the campers. Damn those campers! So now I'll change my tactics: I try to become a close combat killer. I'm fairly certain that this step will halve my already measly KD, but whatever, as long as it's fun...;22 October, 2021;
Hunt: Showdown;heatedfrogger;NOT INFORMED;549 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,750.5 hrs on record;"This is, simply put, my favourite game. There's nothing quite like Hunt out there. It's a difficult, challenging PvPvE game. You play as a bounty hunter tasked with killing a high value target in an area infested with some sort of dark magic. The only problem is, you're not the only hunter out there. You collect clues to locate the target, you kill the target, you banish the target.... then you have to escape the map with tokens proving it's you who killed it. Maps can hold 12 players, which means there will be 10 more people who are intent on stopping you leaving with that bounty. And almost everything you do can be heard by everyone else on the map, meaning you have to move as quickly as you can, whilst going as quietly as necessary. The gameplay loop is incredibly satisfying, with the right balance of risk and reward. Most things you do in a match earn you an amount of cash to take to the next lobby, where you can then either save for a rainy day, or buy higher tier equipment for your next loadout. But, anything you die with is lost to the bayou - hence the risk. If your hunter survives, they get experience and you can use that to buy some traits that make them marginally better for the next run out. This system sounds like a ""win more"" system, where success leads to a higher probability of success on the next run, and so it seems inevitable that the good get better equipment to be even more effective - so how can a new player break in?The answer is quite simple. all equipment has a situation where it's the best choice. The starting rifle has a larger magazine than most other guns in the game and shoots more quickly, so favours closer quarters fighting. The starting shotgun has the longest one-hit-kill range of all the shotguns. Ultimately, playing to your loadout's strengths and being better than your opponent has a FAR higher contribution to your success than the exact equipment everyone loaded in with.The barrier to a new player is therefore not an insurmountable equipment difference, it's learning the game. There are (currently) three VERY full maps, each of which is absolutely crammed with minutiae. It's about knowing how to move around compounds without triggering sound traps quickly. It's about knowing which directions you're actually vulnerable from. It's about knowing which sort of gun can shoot through that wooden wall you know they're crouched behind. It's about knowing that when the shot sounds like THAT, that means it's this specific gun and how far away they are. The burden of knowledge you have to accumulate to become proficient is very high. It's this burden of knowledge which is the thing you, as a potential buyer, have to consider. Are you prepared to get shot from places you don't understand for 20 hours? Are you prepared to be surprised by what their equipment did? You will likely die a lot before you get good. But when you DO become proficient, there is nothing like this game. Nothing replicates the thrill of you and a partner (or two) methodically outmanoeuvring another team and taking them down. Another (major) point in the ""pro"" column is the developer team. They are extremely active with the community, and listen to and implement suggestions from the community very proactively. They are continually improving the game and adding loads of content. I have bought a lot of the (cosmetic) DLC, purely to support the team, as I have gotten way more out of the game than the price I paid to get in.Despite every other shooter I try, I keep coming back to Hunt. As long as there are other hunters to go up against, I think I might never stop.";24 August, 2021;

Hunt: Showdown;HankMcTankerton;148 products in account;418 people found this review helpful14 people found this review funny; Recommended 168.7 hrs on record;"This is an OLD REVIEW that has been updated to the full release version of Hunt: Showdown. Many things have changed, and the review is horribly outdated, so I have done my best to include all of the new updates in the review. PROS: - The atmosphere of the game is amazing. You can really get immersed in the world alone, depsite the lack of NPCs or voice acting.- Graphics to this game look fantastic, even on low settings.- Weapons feel good, shoot good, and make you feel powerful with each shot. Also includes bullet speed, and one-shot headshots up to reasonable distances depending on ammo type.- A leveling system, complete with weapons, perks, abilities, and consumables to unlock and equip, and a near-endless variety to pair and test out together.- Lots of weapon and character variety. From rifles with bayonets to silenced revolvers. From a noob cowboy with plain pants and a shirt, to legends wearing black dusters covered in skulls, trinkets, and scars.- Enemy AI variety is good, making you adapt to their fighting styles and how to counter them effectively. Some enemies rush you mindlessly, but others will sit back and try to take you out at a distance. The AI is simple, but effective at their job.- The sound design. From the crunching of glass under your feet, to crows taking off when people are too close. The way the barn creaks when you take a step. The distant gunshots and being able estimate how far they are by the sound. Everything revolves around sound, and the sound is beautiful.- Weapon balancing. Every weapon this game is viable. The later weapons may be more powerful, sure, but you have a reduced ammo pool and ammo replenishment compared to earlier weapons, longer reload times, longer pauses in between shots, and a higher price point. You want to be able to keep an enemy suppressed for days? There's a weapon for that. you want to stay calm, and pick them off with a single, well-placed headshot? There's a weapon for that. You want a single-action revolver with a stock and a short range scope? There's a weapon for that... for some reason.- Random gameplay. Not in the bad way, either. One game you might not hear a peep the entire round, but the next, gunshots are ringing out from every single direction. You never truly know what's going to happen when you drop into the bayou.- Having an objective. Oh my god, having an objective. It's what separates this game from PUBG and Escape from Tarkov. Having that tangible, ever-present quest in-game, that requires multiple steps to complete most times, makes the game into more than a PvP experience. It's not something that you can be sneaky about most of the time. You have to reveal to EVERYONE where you are to complete your objective. MEH: - The price. This comes down to personal preference, and whether or not you like the amount of content so far. 2 different levels with multiple areas to explore, different times of day, 3 unique bosses, and a metric ton of challenges and weapons to unlock through gameplay.- The coop. While it is insanely fun, it can be a real pain if you join with a random partner over and over. There is also the choice of playing with group of 3 rather than 2, but can be opted out of if you would just like to play in a duo. This depends on whether or not you have someone to play the game with, and I would highly recommend picking it up if you have a confirmed partner to play with.- The bosses. The bosses themselves are great, but the variety isn't, with only 3 bosses to go after. This depends on whether you really care about the boss fights, or whether it's the PvP and world that interests you.- As far as I can tell, you need a beast of a rig to run this thing properly. It doesn't mean that you won't be able to play, but you'll be confined to playing on lower settings. Not a huge loss overall, but some people are all about dem gwaffics and framerates. The game seems to be getting more and more optimised with each update, so it'll hopefully only get better from here.- The community. I'll go into detail on this later in it's own section, because it's a tough one to cover in a few sentences. CONS: - The loading. Loading screens are long, which is understandable, since the map is massive. The in-game loading of objects and enemies, isn't. Having a hotspot be completely void of life, then spawn in 3 tough AI enemies 30 feet away both ruins the immersion and your planning from time to time.- The solo play. While you are dropped in without a partner, other people can still join with a partner, putting you at an obvious disadvantage, making solo play quite difficult. You do get a bonus for doing this, but it normally won't apply to you, since you'll end up dead. Not impossible to do, but takes a lot more skill with a meagre offering to balance it out.- The updates. Every update normally causes some type of havoc, whether it be textures getting broken, rewards not loading properly, or server disconnects. Every update seems to play around with something unintentional, which is probably thanks to the spaghetti code that's held together with masking tape and wrapping paper. Expect a few... weird... occurrences to pop up from time to time.- The learning curve. If you don't have an experienced teammate to play with, there is a lot of trial-and-error you will be doing, and you will be stomped into the mud. Over and over. I would definitely suggest watching tutorials or videos on youtube on how to actually play, because there are quite a few concepts that aren't explained anywhere in-game. When should you shoot AI? How does poison work exactly? Why did someone throw a lantern at my ""dead"" friend? This isn't Call of Duty. You won't know everything, and it will be the death of you. Shrug it off, grit your teeth, and jump back in for revenge. COMMUNITY This community should *really* be avoided for the first little while. While they can be helpful, a large amount have found the mentality of ""This game has been ruined by those filthy casual gamers"" due to new updates from the devs. It hasn't really been ""casualized"", but has been made different from what it once was. Balancing is a fickle thing, and some people would still rather have the game be reverted back to the 0.6 update, or even the 0.1 alpha.Every single corner of the reddit, steam forums, or elsewhere, are going to be coated in people complaining about how base mechanics and weapons are overpowered, while others claim that they're underpowered. Burning a downed hunter (which slowly removes him from the match unless his teammate revives him in time) is vilified by a lot of people in this game. They cite it as an unfair and stupid tactic, labelling the people who do this ""insta-burners"". Then you have the crowd who oppose this idea, saying ""Is there any reason to not give yourself an obvious advantage over your opponent?"".There's also a lot of hate surrounding the ""camping"" in this game. This game with have hectic, tense moments, where you run and gun your way through the woods to extraction. But... you'll also have times where the gameplay slows to a crawl, because 2 teams refuse to move. The team inside the house knows that, with their shotguns, they'll be at a disadvantage if they leave their cover to take on the rifle users outside, and the team outside realises the opposite. Therefore, both teams sit on their hands for ~30 minutes without doing anything. This gameplay scenario is looked down upon from every angle, but it's because people want the other group to make a mistake. Both teams are technically making the right decision. you decide on how you want to play, not the community. VERDICT: Overall, despite its flaws,the game is surprisingly stable, and surprisingly fun, for those who can run it. I would suggest picking it up, but I would also suggest picking it up with a friend, or be prepared to get destroyed your first few games.";17 March, 2018;

I primarily farm PvE and only occasionally seek out PvP (though it finds me plenty). I've even managed to take out a couple of two-hunter teams. I'm sure others are like ""pffff, so what? I do that all the time!"" but for me that was quite difficult and made for very proud moments. The PvE is fun, and the PvP is also fun.The 1800s firearms are just super duper well done. Reloading animations take forever (as they should with these guns), in a far more realistic way than most FPS games. When I press the button to reload my revolver, the animation is: I hold the gun up, open the loading port, eject the spent casing, load in a fresh bullet, revolve the cylinder and repeat until fully loaded, close the loading port, spin the cylinder, and pull the hammer back. Firing and reloading are just so satisfying, coming from the perspective that I love these old firearms and enjoy the immersion/realism that goes into their operation in the game. The guns and gun-play are the main things that draw me to the game. I'd love to see a single-player campaign for this, either as content for Showdown or as a separate stand-alone title. I'd play the ever-loving tar out of that too.The sound design in the game is absolutely top notch. Hearing footsteps, broken glass being tread upon, chains rattling, doors opening, etc. all around you is very important. The directional audio is second to none and can help to keep you alive if you are paying attention. Gunshots can be heard from across the map, and each gun (or gun type at least) has it's own sound. You can tell what type of gun someone is using, and approximately how far away they are, and in which direction from the sound that is generated.

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition;lovinglife139;1,869 products in account;603 people found this review helpful23 people found this review funny; Recommended 73.5 hrs on record;"Let's face it: you're not reading reviews for Age of Empires II because you've never heard of it before. you want to know how the Definitive Edition adds or takes away from experiencing one of the most popular RTS games of all time. Coming from someone who has played Age of Empires II regularly since its release in 1999 (I own the disks, supported the HD version, and now this), I'm so happy with this. My review will focus on updates and changes, good and bad, for players already well-versed with the older versions of the game.First of all, this game looks gorgeous without sacrificing the original aesthetic. This is important. I'm not a huge graphics gal. if it looks pretty, great! But how does it PLAY? I worried that all the updates would turn one of my favorite games of all time into one that barely resembled what I know, and that isn't the case. Though everything is updated--from the tiniest fishing boat to each tree and forage bush--it all resembles its original aesthetic. Snow glistens. Fish swim in schools beneath crystal clear waves. Clicking on the ground to approve the construction of a building puts its blueprint outline down in a satisfying burst of dust.Not only are the graphics updated, but some choices were made that, while unnecessary, are only appealing. For example, while foraging a bush, it loses its robustness over time before becoming sparse just before it depletes. The same happens with ore mines. And oh my GOODNESS--destroying buildings is so supremely satisfying. Rather than just gain flames before instantly turning into rubble, the building collapses in spectacular fashion, each brick and shattered piece of glass tumbling to the ground under a cloud of dust. Different architecture leads to matching piles of rubble. To say I'm impressed by this is an extreme understatement.What about gameplay? The HD version released in 2013, and I found myself so frustrated with the updated AI. It ruined the game. Allies would build one army and then, once killed, would literally stop playing. Like the HD version, the Definitive Edition allows you to choose from CD AI and even the HD AI if you choose, but they have their updated version as well. I have yet to play with the updated AI, so I can't speak as to its nature. But once you choose the CD AI, the option sticks (unlike the HD version, where you had to choose it every time). All the commands work and have been updated with new voiceover. However, I couldn't find the taunts (Edit: Nevermind! I simply couldn't find them in the longer list of chat commands. ""Woololo!"" to your heart's content!).The Definitive Edition adds 3 new campaigns and 4 new civilizations. It also has updated music--while it sounds beautiful, there are certain memorable beats to the old tunes that are dulled in the updated version. On one hand, the music gets less ""repetitive"" by taming these memorable parts, but on the other hand--the old soundtrack is the best and I want to hear it!Overall, the game runs well on its highest settings for me. Every once in a while it'll lag a bit--I think that coincides with autosaves--but not often enough to be an issue. I play on ludicrous size maps with 8 players, so there are always tons of armies and chaos on screen. Speaking of maps, the selection here is wonderful! All the original types of random maps are here, and there are added types (including ""migration"" maps, that are low on initial resources and cause you to battle it out while trying to grow your empire). Additionally, you gain additional options when it comes to the kind of random map you want to play. Selecting water-based, for one example, will select all water-heavy types of maps and choose randomly. You can also literally choose each individual type of map you're open to and apply the settings.Other last-minute pros and cons: the maps are overrun with relics, which is awesome if you like collecting relics to grow your gold reserves. I haven't run low on gold yet, and I've played around a dozen maps thus far. Mills and docks now give you the option to reseed farms and fish traps automatically as long as you have the resources--infinitely. The days of crazily clicking to fill your reseed queue are gratefully over. There are tons of mini-map options here, but they've taken away the combat/economic options (Edit: My mistake, they simply moved it to a new toggle button).Sometimes the game suffers from odd glitches where someone will resign and the game won't notify you (you'll just notice their name crossed out in the corner if you select the scores to show up above the mini-map). Every once in a while units will slide across the map, and I've witnessed monks moon-walking more than once. I find both these glitches hilarious and would rather them *not* be fixed, to be honest. It only happens once every few hours of playtime so it's more of a pleasant surprise than an immersive-breaking experience. Finally, the achievements are more completionist-based and don't require millions of hours of playtime like the HD version (play 1000 games as all empires!), thank the gods.I'm very protective of Age of Empires II. it's a game I will regularly play until I die, so I want it treated right. The Definitive Edition does it justice, and the helpful updates add so much value. To those of you who love this game already, support this version for as much money as you can spare. To anyone who hasn't played Age of Empires II and is looking to start, this is a great opportunity to do so. Take notice, developers: THIS is how you update an old beloved classic.";1 March, 2020;

From the point where I was old enough to play games I would be sitting on his lap as we used to challenge each other in games like AoE, Cossacks, Day of Defeat, America's Army 2, and Command & Conquer. We both bought the Steam (2013) version of AoE 2 in 2017 or 2018, and while I still only have a measly 7 hours played on steam he had already played past a thousand hours.When I found this Definitive Edition on the store for preorder I was literally on the verge picking up the phone to give my dad a call to inform him of the game, but he had already passed for a few weeks at that point. It's one of those things that slip past your mind and you later realize during the moment. Can't explain how sad I was at the moment of realization, knowing my father won't get to play it himself. But knowing him I am sure he would've loved it with these new graphics and settings, and would most likely yet again surpass over a thousand hours.Even after barely playing the game I can say that this upgrade is great, the improvements to the menu and graphics are very welcome. The blur is a bit annoying, but can be majorly fixed with the sharpen, depth of field, and anti-aliasing options.This is not a pity call to get people to feel sad for me, or for my dad. I just felt a urge to write this ''review'', to show how much this game meant to me and to my father. for giving me so many good memories with him, although most of them are not on the steam version.I'm sad that I won't be able to play with you more, but I'll be sure to play this a lot for you in your stead, since you are not able to. Thanks for molding me into who I am, and for introducing me to many great games, dad. Some of which are still my favourites, and most likely always will be.Rest in peace.????

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition;crab_shell;209 products in account;242 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 143.6 hrs on record;I have spent thousands of hours of my life playing many versions Age of Empires II. No joke. Check my hours counter for the HD edition in my library. I grew up with playing Age of Kings with my friends in grade school, procrastinated with the HD edition through high school, and even spent Friday nights in college playing Arabia and CBA. I know how the game probably better than any other video game. And let me say this. Microsoft has done a near flawless job of keeping the 'feel' of the original game in the remake, while managing to improve the game in almost every aspect. The first example of major improvement is found in the new orchestral remastering of the soundtrack. This alone was worth the 3rd time I had purchased this game in my life. The nostalgic beats and rhythms of the classic game ring true after all the years, but are brought to new life with incredible vocals, room filling sound, and surprising depth as soon as you load up the game. The music is clean and would fit in any modern game and yet it always stays rooted in the music you remember. Graphically, the game excels. The devs definitely had a challenge here. Playing the game requires you to be able to quickly identify buildings, units and terrain at a glance. This means that each building and unit on the field need their own graphical representation. The graphics also had to be reminiscent of the old game to allow players to jump over without much trouble. On top of all this, many of the civilizations have their own architecture styles. Microsoft balanced this perfectly. The units and buildings are fresh and look nice from a graphical point of view, but are similar enough to the old game that there is no problem jumping from one version to the next. A+ work from Microsoft here. Another great add was the ladder matchmaking system. Being able to queue up for a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 in deathmatch or random map and play a person your rank is huge. Totally cuts down on the lobby system found in HD. The lobby does stick around for those who want to play custom scenarios or play weird setting games with their friend. The matchmaking mode tended to get me in a game in as little as 2 minutes. Not super fast, but certainly serviceable. Great system all around.Pathfinding was a huge issue in the HD edition. Units would take inexplicably long paths to get places, get caught on each other in big groups, and would generally bump into each other making life rough. In DE, the pathfinding is at least slightly better in worst case scenario and in best case it flows smoothly and in a more impressive way. There is still the odd villager who wanders out into the middle of nowhere, but more often than not, units move, attack, and respond much better to user inputs. The quality of life improvements jammed into the game make it so much easier to play and not worry about the button pressing parts of the game. Being able to queue up upgrades and see what you're producing at a glance is a great. It is much easier to manage your economy and military. Great job here too. The game is not perfect. I think there needs to be a new player lobby for people brand new to the game. Perhaps only allow 10 games in the new player lobby to learn the game before being kicked to the wolves in the real lobby. I think there are some performance improvements to be had as well. The game is somewhat taxing on the hardware, but has good settings for both audio and video. All in all, this game is worth the $15 if you already own the game, and the $20 if you didn't. The developers clearly worked their butts off to make this game spectacular.;16 November, 2019;
Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition;Mantha;387 products in account;281 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 61.0 hrs on record;"A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the ""queue re-seed"" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.";4 November, 2020;

ARK: Survival Ascended;Khorvex;NOT INFORMED;2,146 people found this review helpful42 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 1,032.2 hrs on record;"First of all, let me clarify that I was a huge fan of Wildcard and the entire Ark franchise. With over 10,000 hours in Ark Survival Evolved and over 1000 hours in Ark Survival Ascended, I believe I can provide an informed opinion on whether it's worth spending money on this game.One thing to make clear upfront is that ASE was in Early Access until August 29, 2017, just like ASA is now. The first add-on, Scorched Earth, was sold on September 1, 2016, even before the game was finished. The Ark community was already so large at that time that they didn't hesitate to ask for more money for an unfinished game that was full of bugs and had poor performance, which was almost outrageous back then. The same thing is happening now with ASA. ""Premium Mods,"" ""Adventure Packs,"" and soon new add-ons are being pushed at every opportunity to milk the cash cow.Ark Survival Ascended was touted as a revamped version of Ark Survival Evolved, with improved Unreal Engine 5 resulting in performance gains and better graphics, a major overhaul of dino AI, and many other improvements over its predecessor.So what remains of all that in the end? The game looks marginally better than the predecessor on the highest settings but is practically unplayable in terms of performance. I'm playing the game on a relatively new PC with a RTX4080 and a 7800X3D in 4k. FPS ranges between 20-50 with an average of about 30 on official servers. But the dino AI must be much better now, right? No, the dinos behave even more unrealistically than before, and there's still no sign of herd behavior or any other signs of intelligence.Despite the advertised improvements, the game is worse than its predecessor, has less content, and only creates more opportunities for the developers to generate money.I was once a blinded fanboy of Wildcard who blamed all faults on Snail Games, but in the end, the relationship between the two companies is not one of servitude.Since 2015, Wildcard has failed to meet a single deadline and has not fulfilled more than half of its promises.So is it worth spending money on this game at this point in time?A resounding NO.The game is so full of bugs and crashes that it's hardly worth tackling for anyone who isn't deeply passionate about the subject matter.It's better to check back when the game has left Early Access and all the controversies around Snail Games have been resolved.Edited the RTX mistake :p@Randy: Thats pretty much what i said^^@Cam: I'm playing the game since 2015 and its official branch shutdown was in 2023@MyCoxinCider: Ark has a lot of addicts :p I know ppl that even doubled or trippled down my ASE Playtime@DROPDEADdOE: As a fan of a franchise and a company, one often does things that are not rationally explainable. However, it is possible for anyone to alienate their hardcore fans, as in this case. You should definitely reconsider your way of communicating. Playtime correlates with the expenses of a game that does not operate on a subscription basis, not with the income of the company."; 2 March Ear;

Honest to god, its one of my favorite games of all time. I have ADHD, and so it can be hard for me to stay interested in a game for a long period of time, but not this one. I can easily sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game and it'll always be so much fun. However, there's a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Greed, and Laziness. The developers are fairly lazy. There's bugs in the game that have existed for many many years now. The same bugs in the old game, on the new one. If they built it from the ground up again, how could that be? It seems to me like they got lazy, and started copy and pasting code or something. If you're not sure the remake is worth 40$, rest assured, it isn't. Unless you have a really powerful computer, you're gonna have to end up playing on low settings anyways. A remaster with the same bugs and issues, years and years later. How can you call that a remaster? Disgraceful. We also have to talk about the greed. While i still feel wildcard is greedy, i don't think they're actually that bad. The real problem is their parent company snail games, as well as their server provider nitrado. Snail games is incredibly greedy. They please their shareholders by making pump and dump survival games, that they always eventually abandon. Ark is their golden goose. Its the one they put the most care into upholding. Yet they still ???? in everyone's cereal, constantly. Don't forget that this remaster was going to be free. There's even been fiasco's in the past where snail games employees get raided, and they just ban the people who raided them off of the official server network. However the greediest of them all, is 100% without a doubt nitrado. Basically to sum it all up, wildcard was in debt and needed servers. Nitrado offered to loan them servers, but they wanted to exclusive rights for server hosting on Ark Survival Ascended. Wildcard obliged, and so now nitrado holds a complete monopoly over server hosting. The CHEAPEST server you can buy is 25$ a month for 20 slots. If you know anything about renting servers, you'll know thats pretty abhorrent. Thats incredibly expensive for servers that run like absolute ??????? anyways. Constant Rubber-Banding, teleporting all of the place, rollbacks, insane amounts of lag so much so offical network is literally unplayable for me right now. I'm supposed to live about 150 miles away from where the server is hosted, yet i always get 150 ping on NA servers. Its atrocious. I know snail games will never change their greedy ways, but i can at least hope the server hosting situation gets sorted because at this point i can't afford to host a server for just me and a few friends. And even if i could, it would suck anyways. If you wanna buy it, i totally get the appeal. But do not support this kind of behavior. Wait till its on sale, or the issues have been fixed.

In 3 hours I have crashed about 7 times, I've updated my graphics drivers and I like to think I keep my PC in overall good health so I can only think it is to do with the game rather than my PC. This game seems incredibly unstable. Playing alone and spamming saves whenever I remember seems to be the only way I can get anything done - because otherwise I will crash and lose all progress from when I last saved.EDIT 1.1: Okay so I haven't been crashing nearly as much anymore. I wish I knew what it was that stopped the crashes, but day 1 I was just getting loads and after a couple days it has improved significantly. Performance is still pretty ?????? and there are some performance bugs that are quite significant.EDIT 2: So after they released that optimisation patch it *has* helped, but still has a long way to go. I put together a spreadsheet of how much each setting impacts the overall performance.Spreadsheet[docs.google.com]PROS:The most fun I have had in ARK Survival Ascended so far was in the character creator, seeing how truly horrendous I could make my character look. The quality of the character is pretty damn good - although there are quite a few less options for some things now.The game looks phenomenal. Absolutely stunning, it's got to be one of the best looking games I have seen in terms of general landscape and lighting. That is if you can run it, but we'll get to that.The foliage and just all the details in general look really good. Global Illumination does a LOT of the heavy lifting in terms of how good the game looks, which is a shame because it seems to be the most demanding setting.I haven't had the chance to check them all out, but the new buildings look pretty incredible. I love the changes they've made to the style the buildings are in and it does a lot to make things look innately pretty rather than the less than appetising structures in ASE. Especially happy with the change to the wall height - making them square rather than the weird rectangles they used to be.The main menu re-design looks great and works so much better. More settings are exposed for hosting a server locally/single-player which makes it so so much easier to set up the rates and settings you want without having to outside of the game edit a .ini file.Although there aren't many yet, having mods built directly into the main menu and allowing them to be cross platform is great and really improves how easy it is to install/manage mods without messing around with the Steam Workshop's awful UI.CONS:Okay the elephant in the room - this game runs truly awfully. I was worried it was going to be the case, but hoping that all the incredible tech in UE5 such as Nanite would pull things together and make it run alright. But the minimum/recommended specs are a bit of a joke - and the fact it runs awfully even on a top end system from a year or so ago is beyond crazy. I'll leave some numbers below for those interested based on my PC.The in game UI looks good overall - but some aspects are a bit harder to read, and it overall feels a little slower/clunkier. Opening the inventory seems to take more time and that really adds up to be very irritating.Some settings really just seem to hog most of the performance. I can get the game in a pretty good looking state, but it will run at 35fps. If I change General Shadows from High to Medium, I immediately start getting 60fps. This is a shame, because having shadows on anything lower than High makes them look awful. Medium shadows just creates a very visible cut off radius around your character where no shadows are rendered, so everything in the distance just looks totally incorrect. But it's the difference between 30 and 60fps. There doesn't seem to be a way to raise the difficulty/max level past 150 currently. Maybe you can edit an .ini file, but there is no setting that you can change in the menus when setting up a world.You can increase the difficulty by going toC:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ARK Survival Ascended\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsOpening GameUserSettings.ini and underneath [ServerSettings] add OverrideOfficialDifficulty=5The number can be anything, multiply it by 30 to get your max level. So 5 * 30 = 150. If you want max level of 180, use 6.I also can't find a setting to increase the number of dino spawns, I really haven't ran into many dinos.MISC:The new building parts are great, and a lot of improvements have been made to the building system. However I do still think that there are just some incredibly obvious pieces missing. Why are quarter floors added when there's no quarter foundation, or even a half foundation? You are able to place 2 quarter floors in the same square that a foundation would fit in - so surely adding in a quarter foundation which can do the same can't be that hard, right? It really limits the usability of them imo because it doesn't connect nicely to anything.Same with quarter size wall slopes. Maybe I'm the crazy one - but it seems that if you are going to add a building item such as a ""quarter size"" structure, it makes sense to add the entire set of items so that any one of them actually has something to connect to in a way that makes sense and fills gaps left otherwise.Overall - I really wouldn't recommend the game in it's current state unless you have an absolutely insane PC built within the last 12 months.Some rough numbers:For reference - I have a Ryzen 7 5800x, RTX 3080ti, and 32GB of RAM. The game is installed on an M.2 SSD. I run the game at 1440p.The following numbers in no way are a proper benchmark, they are just rough averages for where I happened to be in game at the time I was testing this - but it should give you an idea of what to expect if you run a similar system to me.Epic Settings - No DLSS - 1440p - ~15FPSEpic Settings - Performance DLSS - 1440p - ~25-30FPSMedium Settings - Performance DLSS - 1440p - ~40-45FPSLow Settings - Performance DLSS - 1440p - ~60-75FPSLow Settings - Performance DLSS - 1080p - ~70-75FPSThey've since released an optimisation patch that invalidates these numbers. Check the spreadsheet mentioned above instead for more detailed numbers.I know the game looks phenomenal but I really do think there is more to be done to make this game run better than it does. Most of the reason for the remake was the increase in graphical quality - and when most of your players, pre-existing or not, are not going to be able to use most of the graphical upgrades, it's a total waste and defeats the point.";26 October, 2023;

Gears 5;for;NOT INFORMED;156 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 138.3 hrs on record;I figured I'd write something up for this game while it's on sale. After roughly 120 hours of play between campaign, horde, escape and PvP, there are definitely some things that still need to be addressed with this game that hinder the overall experience. Overall, though, despite some obvious issues, I've really enjoyed my time playing this game between all these modes and am looking forward to playing more while new characters and maps are added over time.CampaignThis is likely the main draw for this game, as it was praised left and right by a bunch of Youtubers and journalists as being a breath of fresh air, despite not really reinventing the wheel at all. In a market where every single game has to be open world and determined to waste my time with a bunch of useless bull crap collectibles, I was kind of disappointed to hear that there would be more open sections in this game that you could explore during the middle of the campaign. While it is true that 2 of the 4 acts in this game are open-world sections, I didn't get that same monotonous vibe that I usually get from your typical Ubisoft sandbox, but that's mostly because these areas aren't really that open.So if you were wondering if playing the campaign would be boring because of these open world changes, I can safely say that that's not a problem. It's a short game, but it never gets boring.Aside from that main change, the overall story, characters and set pieces are fine. There aren't really any standouts from your usual Gears fare, though I will say that the dialogue this time around is actually quite enjoyable. If you're into the story aspect of the Gears universe, you'll enjoy what's presented here. The main mission set pieces are pretty great and can be pretty challenging even on normal, and the side missions, while incredibly short, are also well done too. Mechanically, the big difference for this campaign besides the open world stuff is how co-op works. Instead of four people at once, it's now three, with one of those people playing as a Jack robot. It's disappointing that four player co-op is dropped, and the only split screen component on PC is for the campaign, but it's still pretty enjoyable with a couple of buds, especially considering one of your buds won't be playing as a traditional COG meathead with a Lancer.PvPI'll be totally upfront here: I'm not as invested in the PvP component of this game as most other dedicated Gears players are, so take my opinion here with a grain of salt. Between ranked modes, casual play and the random game modes that they cycle through as weeks pass, PvP can be a lot of fun. I've personally had no problems getting into a match for any mode that I hop into (this game is cross platform with Xbox Live and Game Pass players on PC, so the amount of people playing hopefully won't be a problem for a long time). Although I say this, I've read from several other people that match making can take quite a while, so I can tell you that connectivity experiences will differ between different people based on, uh... the Coalition? I haven't personally had problems, but this has been an on going problem for a lot of people since this game came out a couple months ago. So the main take away is: match making is hit or miss.As I mentioned earlier, I don't dabble much in competitive multiplayer, but I can tell you that based on what I've seen, the ranking system is total garbage. Don't be surprised if you manage to carry your team the entire time, have a ridiculously good K/D, AND win the match, and still somehow drop a ton of points on your rank. There hasn't been any explanation of how this ranking system from what I've heard, but it is still in dire need of being reworked. Balancing is constantly being reworked too on weapons, and as it stands right now nothing really feels under or over powered.I've gotten a lot of good mileage from PvP in this game, but experiences vary on a wide scale. With it being as inconsistent as it is among players in its current state though, I honestly can't recommend this game based solely on the PvP unless you're willing to put up with a lot of potential heart ache.HordeThis is usually the main draw for me for why I even buy Gears games in the first place, and I've had a really good time with it in this iteration. The main differences between this and past horde modes are:;24 November, 2019;

Download their ghost and you can have as many practice matches against it as you like it to learn how to handle their moves, without having to set up a study session in practice mode (which is also greatly improved, btw.)There's a lot to like about this game, but AI ghosts are the most important for me.

I got this game on sale, and still honestly feel ripped off. With the base version of the game, the majority of the the content is hidden behind a pay wall. Including most importantly the characters, I would be fine if it was just cosmetics, but over half the cast is inaccessible (don't even get me started on the stages, music, cosmetics etc). Was genuinely shocked to discover that Capcom's reaction to people's frustration with how slow in game currency was earnt at release, was to cut income even further! now the only way to get fight money (the in game currency), is through levelling up, or from online matches. The online matches give you 50 fight money for a win, for context to unlock a character is 100,000......yeah (new stages are 70,000, costumes are 40,000). That should tell you everything about the game's economy you need to know. The sad thing is the game itself is pretty good, what little you get to play of it anyway. I have loved street fighter since I first played SF2 in the arcades.But what capcom did with SF5 has really soured my view of any future involvement with the series. This is all obviously done in a cynical attempt to squeeze more money out of their costumers (who again have already paid for the base game), but i'm not spending another penny on this game, this anti consumer BS needs to end.;3 December, 2018;

Street Fighter V;Iron_Tiki;NOT INFORMED;222 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 168.0 hrs on record;After many hours, a great number of ranked matches and late night lobbies, and a couple local tournaments, I can finally say confidently that I do not recommend this game.The singleplayer content is barebones and not at all worth playing. This is fine in a competitive fighting game, since the focus is more on competitive multiplayer. If you're not interested in that, take a hard pass on Street Fighter V and play a fighting game with worthwhile singleplayer content. Guilty Gear Xrd is a good one.Mechanically, the game isn't bad at all. It's fairly simple, with a modest amount of easy to understand mechanics that lead to interesting gameplay. It's also popular, so you can always find people online to play with. It's not a difficult game to pick up, and it's more accessible and rewarding than most other fighting games. That said, I still have a few problems with the gameplay.Namely:* Defensive options are awful. This is why high level play is just watching people do meaty setups on eachother. It's also why throw loops are as prevalent as they are.* Questionable design decisions, such as removing frame 1 invuln from all meterless DPs. This really skews the risk/reward of those moves, which is an odd choice from a game franchise that's so rooted in pure and simple fighting game fundamentals.* Timing is sort of strange. It's a game with 3 frame normals, so things like blockstrings and meaty attacks need to be pretty airtight. If they're not (and it's hard for them to be with any sort of network stutter in the mix) then mashing light buttons will get you out of a lot of situations. This should be a bad habit, but it's rewarding in this game for some reason.* The input delay/netcode makes it feel pretty unresponsive. If you're coming from other fighting games, expect to get hit by many fullscreen moves (Balrog's rush punches, Cammy's EX spiral arrow, Ken's EX tatsu) if you don't block preemptively.In terms of everything aside from the gameplay, it's an inexcusable travesty. The netcode is terrible, and even on wired connections with people in my own hometown it feels jerky and frustrating. Other fighting games add input delay, or seem to run the game in slow motion. SFV just teleports you from one connected attack to the next so you can watch yourself die in a jerky mess of unreactable attacks. The netcode also seems to send all the lag to the person with better internet. I remember having a really good night on ranked with seemingly stable connections and slow witted opponents, only to later realize I had been torrenting and my sister had been watching Netflix, presumably sending all the lag to my opponents.Unlocking characters, costumes, colors, and stages requires either making microtransactions with real world money, or spending ingame currency, which is extremely limited and for the most part non-renewable. You get 50 fight money for a win in a ranked match, zero for a loss. Characters cost 100,000 fight money each. You do the math. All the good cosmetics in this game are behind paywalls that you'd expect to see in free to play games. But it's a full price triple-A title, and the character season passes are also inexcusably expensive.Capcom has been pretty terrible with supporting this game as well. Patches are frequently delayed by weeks if not months, and it's missing many quality of life changes that should have been included at time of release (eg. saving battle lounge settings when the game closes, or being able to skip the awful tutorial on a fresh install). They also straight up lied about a Linux release. That was supposed to happen concurrent with the Windows release, but there has been no word from Capcom on that front.I could go on. There's been a very long train of disappointments with this game, and you shouldn't hop on it. Maybe they'll release Super Street Fighter V as the rumors say, and then I'll give this review another revision, but I don't see things changing for the better. The game is still going to be expensive, laggy, and unsatisfying. But it's got a lot of players, so it's got that going for it.Crossplay is very nice though. I wish more fighting games had that.;18 July, 2017;

A bit annoying at first but manageable once you get some upgrades and/or know how to make the bugs clean the area for you.- The bosses at the end of each one the 5 stages of the run have a ""Stonger Enemies and Spawn new Enemies"" Trigger during their battles. You can't take your time to kill them anymore and this trigger can be activated multiple times.- There's still a chance that you will die on the first floor of the first stage on Hazard 1 more than once (The devs have slightly nerfed Haz 1 difficulty on Feb 15th). Don't get frustrated with that.- Cryo is OP.- Driller is the weakest class for now. This disappoints me so very much...- Lootbugs can only be killed with the Pickaxe. They will block your shots and WILL block your path while the Dreadnought prepares their 100+ damage jumping attack.- Golden Lootbugs are really rare in this game.I think these are the most important things to know before buying. i suggest waiting for the game to leave Early Access if more than one of those keypoints bother you."; 15 February;

Dragonheir: Silent Gods;4;NOT INFORMED;334 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 29.5 hrs on record;"The best thing to describe this game is in 3 words and that's in big letters 'PAY TO WIN'.- If you're not a fan of such kind of gameplay, stay away from it.- If you don't want to pay ridiculous amount of money just to be able to summon some GACHA, stay away from it! and by that I really mean A LOT OF MONEY. Let me explain how the summoning works.Basically there are 3 types of summoning in the game, and with summoning you build up your team and ""try"" to play the game.-The first one is daily free summon which gives you 1 summon chance every 8 hours. You choose which affinity you wish for and by chance you might have the affinity. But there is a major problem to it. See, common characters are worth nothing. They are trash. Rare heroes are better and are the most common thing you are going to see and if you are not a money basher high probably you will end up having 1 or 2 maybe 3 epic and the rest is rare heroes in you 5 man team. That depends on your draw luck. Epic heroes are from 15 to 19, Legendary heroes are 20 on the dice. I have never seen a legendary hero drop from a ""free"" pull but some people ""claim"" that they have done it. If you believe this its up to you.-The second way to summon heroes is to summon with the starlight dices (you can name them the purple dices if you want to color code it and its easier to separate for beginners) You can get these dices while playing along, doing quests and getting achievements. Like the 'other' free pull this dice can bring you some Epic heroes which I was able to roll after some easy hundred or more spent dices. You can fairly say that the probability to get an Epic Hero is fairly low, and Legendary was yet to be seen again. I never was able to pull any. Maybe I am very unlucky.-The third way to pull some high ranking hero is the Heliolite dice (the orange dice) Those dices are extremely rare, I just got about 10 or so for free during gameplay and had to buy the rest with red gems which drop from missions, dailies and so on but those don't drop so much so for you to get about 3500 gems which you can only buy 10 heliolite dices, you need to play a whole chapter of the game and just after getting into the second chapter you got enough of those crsytals to but 10 Heliolite dices with which you can summon and which is a TOTAL GACHA in the end and no Legendary is guaranteed. They have some summon events but that is nothing else than bait. Ah by the way, just to be able to buy 3500 red gems you need to pay about 49$/€ so you can guess how expensive a fun this will be for you.So trying to play competitive in the arena? Yea good luck with that. As long as you don't bash around with money, forget even to get to some serious places you will always be the stepping stone.By the way don't let my playtime of 29 hours fool you, this is what I have played on steam. I have this game on my phone which I originally started with and then wanted to play on a bigger screen and by luck found out it was on steam. So you can be sure that some couple of hundred hours are behind the bars before I decided to uninstall and write this review.So all in all, for those who say ""just shut up and take my money"" this is the place for you to shine. Other than that, I highly recommend to stay away from it. You will only be frustrated at the end. You can't compete with paying people, some stages are beyond ridiculous and for you to level up your characters is another pain you will learn very early. Especially the level blockades from 3 star";16 December, 2023;

It has dungeons and dragons in the name!""Utter garbage.This ""game"" makes Raid: Shadow Legends look like a serious strategy game. Worse, its gratuitous monetisation makes the aforementioned Raid look F***ING GENEROUS.Let me be clear with this: I am no D&D know-it-all. I've played a few games of it, played baldurs gate and icewind dale, and watched the cartoon when I was a kid. The first thing that had me dubious of their entire set up was in the intro, where we get a BS ""tutorial"" of a bunch of magical scrubs going up against - allegedly - Tiamat.Now, Tiamat has 5 heads - one for each type of non-metal dragon. Theirs has 3. Seems like the devs nerfed the dragon goddess.Now, somehow, this bunch of unheard of ""heroes"" managed to lop off one of these heads, where on they promptly ""fled"" the battle.One of them took one of Tiamat's heads off with one hit. One hit. Decapitated one of Tiamat's heads. One hit. And that made them say ""lets flee""?!If you're having a tough fight with someone, and by some miracle the other guy loses an arm, you don't bloody run! You've literally just won! The loss of a major limb causes any creature to bleed out! Not to mention with only 3 heads instead of 5, you've just slashed Tiamat's fighting capacity by a third, and yet you run away?!Who wrote this garbage?!Problems with the right, and BASIC D&D CANON aside, the game looks good.But that's all.It takes up over 8 gigs of HD space, and is little more than a crappy auto-battler. ""Oh but you get to direct the characters's ultimates!""No, you mean I have to sit there watching a bunch of counters ticking up until their portraits highlighted and then drag an icon onto a screen.Hardly the most involving tactical combat.Checkers is more tactically demanding.""Oh but you get to upgrade your characters and equip them with gear!""You mean I have to craft a bunch of stuff that allegedly increases their stat lines, which has no effect on them getting their asses handed to them. Seriously, you ""recruit"" a dwarf on the adventure who's supposed to be a f***ing tank who ""specialises in taking damage"". The guy gets one shot practically every fight - he dies in seconds, and then the party line up gets demolished BEFORE ANY OF THE ULTIMATES ARE READY.Yes, he's the same level as the enemies.Yes, he's equipped.Its deliberate to make you spend resources ""levelling up"", and consider dropping cash for the endless amounts of cash shop upgrades, items, premium currencies, and premium character summons and just about everything else you can think of to nickel and dime you into sending bank.f*** off. I've seen this kind of garbage in so many games now, its just a sick joke.They get your hopes up on the ""create character"" screen, by displaying a bunch of races, and have you picking their appearance from a few different options - which are laughably few - which displays the 6 stats most D&D veterans are happy to see: the old STR, DEX, CON stuff. Except the stats are barely above 10, and I'm pretty sure have bugger all impact on the game regardless of which you choose.If I rolled a D&D character and all the stats were 10 and 11, I'd make a new one.Summary:pay2win garbage auto-battler that makes Raid: Shadow Legends look generous and like a tactical masterpiece.AVOID.";15 November, 2023;

Dying Light;Vagrant;431 products in account;1,882 people found this review helpful139 people found this review funny; Recommended 86.8 hrs on record;"Glad to see the misinformed reviews have been thrown out of from the top page. For those who have said that Dying Light's day/night mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesn't actually change in the game clearly haven't played past the intro missions. The first two missions are obviously there to get you started, so they're not going to thrust a timed day/night cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanics, and thus in the intro missions, time does not change if you don't progress the quest. Past those two missions, day/night becomes very real, and incredibly terrifying. /endRantGameplay:I'm sure it's been said before, but this is what Dead Island should have been. Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid. Running around is great fun, and jumping into abandoned houses and exploring/finding loot is constantly fun. And this is where I got caught in my first night phase. I was running towards my objective when ""oh look another shelter, let me go secure it,"" then ""oh look there's an air drop nearby, let me go grab it,"" then again another shelter nearby, on top of random houses and zombies (sorry, ""biters"") to loot, and before I knew it, I got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick (mind you, the Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get home, but I just have to keep scrounging for loot). I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelter, so I just booked it. This is where freerunning gets exciting. With how seemless and smooth it is to run around/through buildings and across rooftops, the run to my shelter didn't feel annoying or like a chore, but more like a challenge to find the smoothest route (very similar to Mirror's Edge). Long story short, night fell, I ???? my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftop, listening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter. I've since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a quest, and I can tell you, as of right now, I am definitely not prepared... but I'm damn excited to finally face the challenge.+ Fluid, seemless parkour+ Combat is fun+ Enemy AI is surprisingly smart+ Terrifying and exciting night cycle+ Scavanging every nook and cranny for lootCharacters:Some characters are well-performed while others just aren't. Gazi's performance, in my opinion, is laughably bad, but I began to think that it may have been intentional? And Rahim... he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the day, all he needs to do is dye his hair yellow. Brecken, Jade and Lena are among my favorite so far, with Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DA:Inquisition with her hair and accent. Overall, characters are decent, and that's all that really needs to be said, so far at least.+ Some interesting characters- Some poor performancesTechnical:Graphics are gorgeous, and surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080. Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance option, I can barely see much of a difference in-game with that option set to half or max. The only issue I've noticed is that very very rarely, when you're fighting biters with melee weapons, the game randomly hitches, then continues normally. It only happens in combat, but not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system. Overall, everything looks great, and the graphics and effects are wonderful. For an ugly game, the visuals are surprisingly beautiful.Sound:Music is great, but my only comment is that the music that plays when you're outside has one part where a random singer begins to chant, and I swear it scares the crap out of me every time. Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfying, and you can tell when you've hit the right spot, while hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump. I've yet to get a gun though (I've spent a lot of time just wandering around so I'm not too far into the campaign) so I can't comment on that. Also, make a little bit more noise and you'll hear bone-chilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you. Very satisfying sound work overall.Story:I haven't gotten far into the story so I'll hold off until I've completed it to fill this section.I basically wanted to come out and say how much I'm enjoying this game and to tell people to ignore the false statements about this game and give it a try. If you liked Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you hated Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you're a fan of first person, open-world games, then I'd bet you'll like this game.";28 January, 2015;

Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can runaround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,you'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact. co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!TL.DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.;9 February, 2015;

How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking ""plenty of time"" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to do, like this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* ""sure I can do that, plenty of time still"". Then only 5 minutes before night, I complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse.

After all it could be rifle ammo, or a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done looting, but oh ????! it's almost 20:00, my watch is beeping, night is coming now!

Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am.

I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW ONCE I GET INTO THE FOLLOWING. ALSO, I HAVE YET TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WITHIN DYING LIGHT. Ok now onto the review for what I think so far :)""Oh man this is just another ???? zombie game."" WRONG. It sure is a zombie game, but the added features of parkour and freerunning, combined with the large open world, and a fresh feel the often over-saturated zombie genre.PROS:- Gameplay is amazing. Parkour and freerunning are both very smooth, and there are very few issues with the movement. The one only area that doesn't do great in this regard is getting up cliffs or rocky areas, but considering that Dying Light takes place in an urban environment, you aren't gonna be climbing up that many cliffs tbh.- Weapon Upgrading feels really rewarding, where you find what you need to upgrade a weapon in the world, and then can add a variety of upgrades to (melee) weapons such as fire, electricity, bleeding, and toxicity. It feels pretty damn cool to get a high end weapon and add flame to it, so when you hit a zombie it will burst into flames. Guns in this game are relatively easy to come across once you get to a high enough survivor level, however it's rare enough that it's still special.- The upgrade trees give really awesome upgrades to your character and general survivability without feeling too overpowered for a good amount of the game. Obviously when you max out all your levels, then you are kind of an unstoppable beast, but at least it's not a situation where you get a level and go from really weak to tremendously overpowered. For Agility, you gain points by (as you may have guessed) running around the map, jumping and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. For Power, you can gain these points from killing zombies and generally doing damage. The best part is that you can get points towards this through molotovs, or other zombie-killing devices other than your own weapons. This is a plus because sometimes you are focusing so much on quests and running around to the point that your agility level is off the charts, while your power level is like, level 5. The Survival level is upgraded by completing quests, capturing airdrops, and saving survivors. One thing to keep in mind, is if you plan to play with friends, I would HIGHLY reccomend having one save file for yourself and another for you to play ewith your friends. I ran into a situation where I was playing by myself and then bringing my friend into that game when he was available. This meant that he only got survivor rank credit from the quests that we did together, and so I was a way higher rank than him. Then there's the legendary rank, which is unlocked after unlocking all the upgrades in every other skill tree. It turns you into a zombie killing tank, by increasing max health, stamina, as well as specific weapon damage. Overall, the upgrades are challenging enough and also provide you with enough reason to try to level up a certain skill.- The world of Dying Light is really damn cool. It seems authentic and realistic, and does not seem forced at all. It makes it really interesting for parkour, as well as when you are running away from a viral or a volatile.- The Volatiles in this game are actually terrifying, and also new and original which is great to see in the zombie genre. They are super-human zombies (rather ironic choice of words but you ge the idea) and they only come out at night. This makes any situation where you are stuck outside after the sun's gone down really damn intense. Dying Light does a great job making you ??????? terrified of the dark. The other zombies and special infected are pretty generic, but still, what those are lacking for, I feel like the volatiles make up for that one hundred percent. There are new infected added into Dying Light The Following from what I have seen, but in the base game, the infected that you encounter in the daytime are pretty damn generic.- The Hud is really clean and easy to understand, no problems whatsoever.- The graphics in this game are beautiful, with lens flare and all other sorts of cinematic effects, you feel like you are playing a movie sometimes. Absolutely gorgeous game!CONS:- As mentioned before, the average infected you will meet will be more of the same. The volatiles I personally believe help change the entirety of the game, but still overall the zombies are pretty underwhelming and quickly become an inconvienence rather than something scary within the game.- The story leaves lots to be desired. There is a lot of stereotypes and a ???? ton of cliches, and is very predictable. - The characters are pretty bland. Many you meet you will frankly not care about. The game lacks in character backstory, which makes you quite apathetic towards a lot of people. That being said, there is one guy (whos name escapes me) that just hangs out beside the elevator in the tower when you ride it up and is like, the nicest dude from the get go. I love that man. In conclusion, if you are looking for a beautiful game with great mechanics player upgrades that you can sink hours into without realizing, Dying Light is the game for you. However, if you are looking for a very story-rich game, then this will fall short. I personally have had a blast with this game, and playing with friends makes the game just that much better. I would highly reccomend. Thanks for reading my review! It is the first review I have done, but who knows, I may do more. Hope you have a fantastic day :)";20 September, 2017;

The issues with F1 2024 are numerous and cannot be overlooked.Firstly, the game feels incomplete and rushed. The handling mechanics are poorly implemented, with a noticeable front-end bias. This design flaw means the fastest way around the track often involves avoiding braking altogether, turning online lobbies into chaotic drift sessions rather than authentic racing experiences.Moreover, the customization options at the initial purchase are severely limited. For a steep price of $110 AUD, players receive only a minimal selection of items. Most of the desirable content is locked behind additional paywalls, a practice that feels exploitative. It is particularly frustrating to see that many features and items that were freely available in the 2023 edition are now gated behind these paywalls. This shift not only undermines player trust but also diminishes the overall value of the game.The degradation of Codemasters’ reputation is evident, and it's clear that EA's financial strategies are to blame. Instead of nurturing the franchise and respecting its loyal fanbase, EA has prioritized monetisation over quality and player satisfaction.; 1 June;

The race is the only session where I participate the whole session. And based on all that, I have pretty much nothing good to say about this game. Graphics and GPU Usage:Admittedly, the graphics are slightly better than F1 23… but emphasis on SLIGHTLY. I’d venture to say that the graphics on the console versions of this game are indistinguishable from the console versions of F1 23. I have a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GPU, which is no slouch. I have an Intel Core i9 processor, which is no slouch. I have 64GBs of RAM, which I am told is no slouch. I’ve played a decent amount of games on Steam and my computer doesn’t even break a sweat playing ANY of them. It may as well be smoking a blunt and listening to Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of The Moon album. I used the NVIDIA GeForce app to show the stats on GPU usage and temperature of the computer and all that jazz. The computer has NEVER gone above 35°C which is 95°F, which in computer terms is ICE COLD. With F1 24, I get BAD frame rate drops despite the computer chilling with Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson. The GPU hasn’t gone about 5% utilization. The temperature of the computer while playing the game is 33°C which is 91.4°F. Even the RAM is barely being used. I had the game graphic on Ultra across the board as I did with F1 23 and I may as well be playing a game with the frame rate of a claymation. I had to turn all the graphics to medium to get the frame rate to 90FPS when I could play F1 23 on Ultra and get about 200FPS, give or take. Steering wheel compatibility:I have the Fanatec ClubSport Racing Wheel, Fanatec DD Pro wheel base and Fanatec ClubSport V3 pedals. Admittedly, my rig COULD be better, but I’m not as rich as Lawrence Stroll so I had to get what I could afford. Now F1 22 had a preset for the Fanatec ClubSport Racing Wheel… F1 23 took that preset out for… reasons… and F1 24 once again seems to have lost that preset’s number. So I have to use the CLOSEST preset I can find. Granted, it still works so I probably have nothing to complain about… but it’s just baffling why EA would do that. The game still works good enough with the rig I have.Force Feedback:I have the settings set to exactly what I had on F1 23. It took me HOURS to get that setup on F1 23 to feel as real as I could get it. Unfortunately, I never drove an F1 car, but I have had laps in real cars and Go-Karts so I have a pretty decent understanding of what a race car feels like. However the force feedback on F1 24 is about as disappointing as the Star Wars sequel trilogy. There is so much more to be desired with this force feedback… I’ve felt better force feedback from Formula One Championship Edition on the Logitech G25 wheel. If that doesn’t get the point across, I don’t know what does. VR:Don’t… even… bother… “Full VR Support” is accurate as a Stormtrooper. If EA was on Maury and they said this game had “Full VR Support” the lie detector would determine that was a lie before they could say “Full”. I have the Meta Quest 3, which I admit is a pain in the ass on it’s own. But it worked PERFECTLY on F1 23, the problems I have with the headset is on iRacing. iRacing on VR is nothing short of torture to try to get it to work competently. F1 24 on VR is about as compatible as cyanide and the human body. I can’t even get ONE LAP done at Bahrain without the game crashing at the final straight before you turn onto the start/finish line straight. Every time, without exception. So a good amount of my “5.1 hour gameplay time” has been dedicated to doing 9/10th of a lap at Bahrain before the game just commits Seppuku. The game is playable on anything that isn’t VR.Gameplay:Boy where do I even start? I’ll preface this by saying this is based entirely on the My Team career mode. So with that in mind, let us continue on. The car understeers into the corners and oversteers into the exit of the corners. So in essence the cars are based entirely on Ferrari’s 2014 offering: the F14 T. The start procedure has been completely butchered… I may as well start the race from the pit lane. I put the car on pole position despite the car’s best efforts to either spin me around like Sebastian Vettel on the opening lap of the 2012 Brazilian’s Grand Prix or plow me into the wall like Ayrton Senna during Qualifying. Then when the lights turn green everyone gets a good start… while my car just stays stationary for a second and by the time my car decided to finally move, I’m in dead last. So I pause the game and restart… same thing happens. I probably attempted the start no less than 10 times and each time my car was napping or having a ???? like Kimi Räikkönen. So now I’ve done the opposite of Markus Winkelhock and going from first to last on the opening lap. So now I have to fight my way back up the positions while having an overfueled car (because these F1 cars at the beginning of each season have a drinking problem and desperately need to go to some AA meetings) and fighting the understeer/oversteer into each and every corner and eventually my strategy paid off and I won the race by a whopping 0.007 seconds over Nico Hülkenberg.Honestly, just buy 22 F1 Hot Wheels cars and race them around your bedroom carpet. That would be more preferable than playing this game.The AI:The AI have a collective IQ of -22… which I guess means it’s pretty accurate to real life. Tsunoda gets a lightning start, going from 22nd to 10th before the first corner… before recreating Bottas Bowling and taking out both Red Bulls, Sainz, Stroll, Ocon and his own teammate Ricciardo. I guess luckily because my car finally woke up and started moving by this point, I dodged a massive Kamikazi bullet. Score 1 for the idiots that programmed the startup procedure. So now, the Haas boys are leading the race, followed by the McLarens and Saubers. Now… I love the Sauber, great drivers, great livery, underdog team. But please tell me why the Sauber cars are infinitely faster than their real life counterparts??? But I digress. I then had the pleasure of watching Magnussen drive like he’s been doing the past few races, while adding a few more tricks from Dale Earnhardt and just pit maneuvering anybody that dares try to pass him. Honestly if it wasn’t for Magnussen, I probably wouldn’t have even finished in the Top 10. He not only helped Hülkenberg lead most of the race but he helped me gain so many positions through putting people off the track and/or into a wall.Modding:I swear EA doesn’t want you to mod in custom liveries and whatnot because they just make it harder and harder as the franchise progresses. Which especially bothers me considering you have a whopping selection of ONE car livery, ONE driver suit, ONE helmet, ONE pair of gloves… and they’re ALL UGLY. Which begs the question of why I even bought the Champions Edition in the first place if I’m not going to get special preorder liveries like I did in past F1 games. So instead of being able to just load up Ego ERP Archiver and upload the liveries and whatnot, I have to wait until some YouTuber is finally able to figure it out and post a video of it. Codemasters were all for being able to mod the game, but EA seems to be adamant about making a terrible game and preventing you from being able to fix it or at least make it somewhat tolerable to play. Overall: I could probably edit this review later on if by some miracle from Lemmy himself that EA actually listens to their customers and start patching the game to make it playable. But until then, just play F1 23.; 31 May;

So they were just too lazy to fix the bugs reported in the Pre-Release build and then.....? Micro-transactions..... on what was free in F1 23? I'm sorry am I going nuts?The Handling is...... different I really didn't like it but after a few races it actually didn't feel all that bad so I have mixed feelings to it, the Creators really did overreact to it though like majorly but I still agree its weird.(I didn't change any wheel settings from F1 23-24 and it was perfectly fine and enjoyable to use)But apparently its really awful on controller which I'm not too surprised about.Also its very unrealistic you can go seconds a lap quicker than the IRL Pole laps and stuff like that so its just stupid if anything.I really like the improvements to the Tyre model but god they have real made a mess of everything starting wet races on dry tyres and the AI refusing to pit and being seconds a lap quicker then them is stupid and was reported before release so they just chose to be lazy?I really like the Career mode updates they make it so much more fun and enjoyable and realistic the secret meetings are awesome and a great addition.Modding has been murdered in cold blood, EA were too lazy to make an Anti-Cheat so instead they use a system that Force Closes your game when you try to mod it.So say goodbye to the cool custom calendars because EA just murdered them in cold blood say goodbye to making cool driver lineups cause they murdered that too and I doubt anyone will find a work around to it.If your going to buy a game just buy F1 23 its really underrated and honestly you could just mod it into F1 24 so probably go buy that instead but its a real shame this game actually had really really good potential they just completely dropped the ball on it.Hopefully things change but I doubt they will Its more disappointing then anything I can't even be mad cause i've come to expect it from EA at this point; 6 June;
[SA] Black Desert - Traveler to Conqueror;SleepyKitti??;NOT INFORMED;22 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 7,286.0 hrs on record;Black Desert is so beautiful! I must give it a very positive review for the following reasons:It's incredibly colorful, there are endless activities which you can try to do in the game.It has a lovely story which you can follow (there are 10000s of quests) but it hasn't got an ending. The game regularly gets new content and it is constantly changing as it is being improved, developed.It has beautiful graphics and an amazing soundtrack. Wherever I go, I just want to stop and stay there for a while until I can completely listen to the songs. Sometimes I don't even want to actually play this game but only listen to the wonderful songs in it.The game (and its story) never ends and there isn't a well-defined goal. It gives you complete freedom, you have to find the activities which you like the most.The world of Black Desert is vast. I haven't even explored half of it. You will always find secrets (which can actually be a purpose of playing it).The community is extremely friendly. Throughout my gameplays, I have only received heartwarming words and helpful suggestions. Players often give up their own goals just to help.The game has a functional anti-cheat. I have never seen cheaters or even unfair players.I think the sentences Enjoy your journey not just your goal and Best Day Online describe this game fairly and accurately.I will also try to describe when Black Desert might not be an ideal game for you:It is quite time-consuming. If you often don't play it for long periods of time (e.g., months), you might find that the game has considerably changed or you have missed a lot of important opportunities. Activity is key in Black Desert.The game is complex and it takes time (this means years) to learn how to play it and to get gear. It supports slow and gradual progression. You won't get everything in the beginning.Don't expect a shooter game-like experience or overly modern elements. This game is set in a medieval fantasy world (which is one of the reasons why I love playing it). You use some kind of sword most of the time. In order to reach distant places, you usually travel on a horse. Getting the appropriate horse is also beautifully detailed process.It is grindy and certain outcomes depend on random factors. You have to accept the fact that sometimes you are lucky, sometimes you are unlucky.And finally, probably the most important: If you tend to compare yourself to others too much or you have a competitive mindset, this is most likely not your game. In Black Desert, you will always find people who are far ahead of you. You simply don't have a chance to reach them because they have spent several years on improving their character and skills. Fairly, you will also have to spend the same amount of time and make the same effort.Black Desert is an ideal game to be played solo, at your own pace, but it can also be played together with friends, which is also so wonderful. I also recommend that you join a guild which shares your interests. There are endless social activities to do and magical places to discover, or just try watching the beautiful stars at night while you're visiting an oasis in the desert. You can even learn to compose and play your own music.??; 11 June;
[SA] Black Desert - Traveler to Conqueror;A;NOT INFORMED;6 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 6,420.0 hrs on record;Black Desert Online offers a unique and engaging experience, but recent changes appear to favor new players at the expense of the existing player base. Despite management's assertions that there is no RNG boost for new players, my personal experience suggests otherwise. After years of attempting to obtain a Garmoth Heart with no success, I have witnessed new players, with accounts only a couple of months old, acquiring not one, but two Garmoth Hearts. Similarly, new players have successfully tapped for T10 horses within 5-10 attempts, while I have struggled with 54 attempts for a Doom T10, spanning over 54 weeks, without success.The enhancement system in Black Desert Online is particularly frustrating. It often leads to disappointment, even after investing countless hours into grinding for necessary items, only to face failure despite a high Valks chance. This system seems unnecessarily tedious and can be discouraging, especially for those who balance full-time jobs and gaming.While newer players may find enjoyment and success in the game, veteran players may feel undervalued and frustrated. For many, starting a new account might seem like the only viable option to experience the game's rewards. However, for me, the lack of meaningful progress has led to a decision to step away from the game entirely.; 8 June;

THE FINALS - Season 3 Starter Pack;Kneegun;54 products in account;59 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 178.9 hrs on record;This is the end of the game. The new ranked mode in Season 3 will kill the game. If before, in the cash out mode, it was difficult to rise in rank playing with random players, then in the new ranking it will not be possible at all, because if you get bad teammates, you are guaranteed to lose, since there is no way to revive your teammate, and to try to win a round in 1 vs 4, 1 vs 5 situations, you need a lower ttk, and in this game it is too high, if in a conditional counter strike you can take a round 1 vs 5 because one shot to the head is a guaranteed death, then nothing will work here. Another point is that it's much easier for attackers, since the defenders have 2 spaced out points that you can't defend, since there are no tools for defense, you can only put 2 mines per round, turrets are destroyed in a few shots, the house can be destroyed to the ground, your health can't be restored in any way. So, yes, the ranked in this game is over, and therefore the game itself, because, in my opinion, the main feature of this game was the tournament cash outs for 4 teams.; 13 June;

Moving Out 2;Nice;NOT INFORMED;64 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 10.8 hrs on record;The first Moving Out was arguably my best purchase I made on steam. This game is ok, even good in comparison to other games I've played, but comes nowhere close to what I liked about the first one. The game didn't have the same charm for me and I couldn't figure out why. I ultimately narrowed it down to the fact that the first game had fairly simple map design, but the progression of map obstacles through out the game made sense without over staying its welcome, This game seems to for the most part, focus on map design and not the gameplay. Even with this change in more complex map design, the game is actually easier because they don't give you medals. I Grinded out platinum medals for the base game and DLC in the first game. You had to learn how to improve by routing certain items first or improving your speed. That element is mostly lost, which is the element which was the best part for me. Most people probably don't care about this level of nuance for a game that is generally perceived as more casual fun, but the surprise of the depth of the first game is another element of why I loved the game so much, it was a beautiful surprise.; 10 January;

Moving Out 2;nahmaz;NOT INFORMED;9 people found this review helpful; Recommended 18.4 hrs on record;A definite improvement on an already solid fun multiplayer game. Everything about it is charming and fun, and this sequel has so much more flexibility than the original. There's some weird quirks for sure. There'll be specific spawn points that always seem to be on an occupied space, and it takes a while to adjust even tho there's NOTHING around this one designated square they assigned. Nothing game breaking but it does get irritating when you fall off a cliff and the one object you have moved happen to be in the random spot they assigned as the spawn point. It's also rough when there's more time spent on puns than explaining how levels/things work. There's much more of a puzzle atmosphere which is great, but a lot of levels clearly expect you to run thru it once to even understand how it even functions.The weirdest quirk tho is the overuse of question marks? Half the sentences said end with that punctuation? And I don't even think it's poor translation or anything it's just always there? And I'm playing this game with my kid who likes to narrate characters so everything ends in an upward inflection? For normal sentences? The puns are bad enough (they're really really bad?) but honestly the frequent indecision is worse?;27 August, 2023;

Moving Out 2;CheeseyHR;770 products in account;10 people found this review helpful; Recommended 17.5 hrs on record;An excellent sequel to the first Moving Out. It takes what made the first game fun, and doubled down and added even more wacky things to work around.If this is your first time hearing of this game. All you need to know is that you are a worker in a moving company, and you must pack furniture in your moving van as fast as possible by any means necessary. The game will get chaotic very quick, and you'll be flinging furniture around at the speed of light through windows and walls to accomplish your goal. The first world is a tad slow, but its just to get you up to speed for the worlds to come. The 3 other worlds in the game really step up on the mechanics and every level adds a new unique feature to work around. You rarely get bored. There is also quite a bit of replay-ability with the level mission system. Each level has 3 extra missions that require you to do something different than just moving furniture. So you usually play the levels at the minimum 2 times or more depending on the missions.There is also some really nice accessibility options with assist mode. Longer timer, move 2 player furniture easier, removing obstacles, etc. So if you aren't as adept at this kind of game and would just like a chill experience, you can do so easily. Overall I recommend the game if you are looking for something similar to Overcooked 2, but more chaotic in energy.;15 August, 2023;

Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2;GuineaPrince;181 products in account;128 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 18.2 hrs on record;"Clearly, Steel Wool has their strength.Not only is this a solid followup to Help Wanted, it improves on the original game in nearly every way. Whereas the original Help Wanted was a mixed bag of truly fun minigames, a few mediocre minigames, and certain minigames that were more annoyingly frustrating than truly difficult, Help Wanted 2 is a lot more consistent. More often than not, the minigames are enjoyable bangers. Fewer minigames are hair-pulling frustrating. Even the Plushbabies have enjoyable minigames - the Plushbabies, universal scourge of Help Wanted 1!But while a fun improvement over the original, it is not without flaws. Ball throwing is a complete gamble, for example, but thankfully no minigames require ball throwing for completion but rather to survive to an end or to use other abilities alongside the balls. Height is inconsistent between minigames, so you'll likely manually adjust your height to -30 or -50 so everything isn't at your knees, and then still need to adjust again for certain minigames like the log ride or Ballora's gallery - which, surprisingly, starts you off 10 feet below the floor and makes game completion impossible without adjusting height to around +20.Speaking of Ballora, certain minigames choose to withhold vital information from the tutorials - vital information like how to actually play. Did you know that Ballora Gallery requires you to grab toward the door and pull yourself forward to simulate crawling across the floor? No, you didn't, because this wasn't deemed important information. At times the game crosses the line from ""player figures out mechanics organically"" to ""oops we didn't tell the player how to actually play"".Which crosses over to lore and secret puzzles, too. When certain hints are revealed to the player, some of them can be reasonably sussed out but others are completely esoteric or rely on outside knowledge of not just American slang, but regional American slang - did you know that some parts of the country call combining every fountain soda into one cup a ""Suicide"" or a ""Graveyard""? Keep that one in your hat for later. And lore-wise, the game continues the Security Breach Series trend of all foundation, no house: expecting you to subsist on breadcrumsb of lore for a Next Time that will never come. Games like these, lore isn't the most important thing To Me, but keeping Vanessa's cut voice lines would have definitely kept the mystery of the game while still providing an actual narrative in the minigames collection.All in all, a remarkably fun collection of Fnaf-based minigames, with challenges that for the most part excite the player instead of frustrate them, and some moments that truly awed me."; 3 January;

Wargaming is continuously pushing the boundaries and testing the limits of its players. If you are familiar with the game ""War Thunder,"" you probably know the consequences when game developers constantly provoke their player base. As players of this game, we contribute to its activity, and in theory, Wargaming should appreciate each and every one of us who continues to support and encourage this game. However, Wargaming keeps pushing the boundaries and exploiting each and every one of us. This recent eighth anniversary is not just a simple anniversary, Wargaming is gradually making it clear that if you don't pay for this game, you don't deserve to play it.I implore every player here to bravely stand up and resist this behavior. Wargaming has now infringed upon our rights as players, and we cannot, and should not, let Wargaming continue to exploit us in the future. It is time for us players to unite and stand together. We should be a collective, a class, opposing Wargaming's exploitation and oppression towards us. We are here to enjoy this game, to find joy in it, and we should not be working for Wargaming.I hope that each player will save and spread this message.

World of Warships;A;NOT INFORMED;481 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 605.2 hrs on record;"Should start by saying the ""600"" hours logged here is FAR FROM how many hours I have invested in this game. I would assume my actual play time is somewhere between 2,000-3,000 hours in total (Maybe even way more. I could be so far off on this number). I've basically unlocked the majority of T10 ships as well as a good number of freemiums and hell, I've even spent money on the game (though my wallet regrets that.)So where do I start with this one. World of Warships is a game that I think everyone who plays it REALLY wants to love. Let's face it, you are in control of big boats and shooting big guns at other ships. It's a blast and mechanically the game is MOSTLY (Important here) sound. So we'll go through a quick pros and cons.Pros:- Art Department. I can't stress this enough. If there is one division of WG that has their stuff together it's these guys. The game looks great and the ships are AWESOME.- The core gameplay itself. (Assuming you have a team that works together it can be pretty rewarding to set up crossfires, angle your ship correctly, have great brawling drive-bys in battleships. It's a blast when it works.)- It's not a hard game to pick up and learn the basics. (More to note here)Cons:- On the note of it being a easy game to learn the basics. It's a difficult game to master. This results in some VERY poor play at higher tiers where people pay their way to get there. - Meta shifts. Currently the game is going through a frustrating shift where stagnant gameplay/static gameplay is becoming more commonplace. HE (High-explosive) shell spam, CV (Carriers), and the upcoming submarines all limit the ability to utilize tactics and work correctly as a team. These three things really damage the core ""tactical"" gameplay that makes the game great. - Balancing. Holy hell... You can look this up on the forums and see how brutal this really is. It's a lot to go over and I'm not going to fill this review with it. The balancing is bad and is only set to get worse. (Tip: Look up Carrier Rework, Smolensk, Colbert, Russian Battleships, Russian Heavy Cruisers, Stalingrad, SAP...) Yeah, there is a lot here. Some has been somewhat fixed but a lot is still problematic and this is parasitic mess that isn't being solved faster than it's being expanded.- Cash Shop. Yeah. ""Free to play game."" But not really. If you play this game without spending money you are in for the grind of your life. It'll be frustrating and at higher tiers you won't break even on credit loss as high-tier ships cost more. Everything costs money - not just a little bit either... Premium time, Ships, Converting XP, Buying Doubloons, Buying Credits, yadayadayada. There is a lot of monetization in this game and it's REALLY important for people to be aware of this before jumping in.- Probably the BIGGEST con of this game is Wargamings disconnect from the playerbase. This game could be great if WG would sit down and listen to some of the playerbase and actually consider their opinion. Recently they had a QNA on their discord which ended up being more of a ""Ask us questions so we can tell you to piss off."" This, unfortunately, sums up most of the interaction with WG and their staff. It's a dodgy company with horrible public relations.- A lot of fantasy ships. Some of which aren't what really need to be added to the game. This goes back to balancing and WG's disconnect. (Looking at you USN Split BB's and Smolensk. WG just doesn't want to listen.)- Competitive is absolutely dead and the rewards aren't worth the pain of taking part. - EDIT (Dec 5th 2020) Figured I should add this to the CONS since it's a pretty big deal! Basically this years Christmas Containers (And 2018/2019) have a shortlist of ships you will ALWAYS get. Problem is, WG advertises it as if you can get ANY of the 107 premiums when in actuality you can only get a handful of ships. I'm not going to explain this in detail, instead I insist you go to the forum post below and look this up. It's VERY scummy since this actually takes advantage of people's wallet WHILE being COMPLETE false advertisement. https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfWarships/comments/k6ivy5/how_wg_chooses_your_santa_gift_ship_and_why_youAnd below one of WoWS larger Community Contributors testing this himself and basically proving it in the video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hyuejlhstsI'm sure I could add a lot more to these lists. Especially on the cons side. But ultimately what is pushing me from the game is just how disconnected Wargaming is and that's really the core of all the things listed in the CONS. This game could be fantastic and I REALLY want it to be fantastic, but I just don't see that happening with WG at the helm.I have a hard time recommending this game in the current state. If this was three years ago it would be a different story. It's just gone so downhill and the quality of the gameplay has grown really stale.";7 November, 2020;

World of Warships;Lethal_Discharge;92 products in account;264 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 0.4 hrs on record;"So I went through the effort of downloading and launching this game for 5 minutes just to write this review. So if you are new to the game and genuinely wanting an honest opinion on it, please read my words carefully.I've been playing this game for a little over a year now on Wargaming's client. I have over 2000 battles and 4 tier 10 ships grinded out as well. And am well on my way to more. Alright I'll get down to what everyone seems to be clamoring about and try to give an overview on it from the perspective of someone familiar with the system.Free to Play.All the skill needed in the game comes from a willingness to learn and the time invested in improving your skill. There are players I know personally who are quite good if not better than average without spending a dime. Most of the money that gets whaled on the game is spent by naval enthusiasts who just want to collect another historical ship. So how does this ingame F2p economy work?Game progression works where each ingame nation has several tech tree lines to progress through in various classes of ships. Each line is divided into 10 tiers which determine the matchmaking the ship gets as well as it's overall power relative to other ships. Each battle you play you will earn credits and exp. The amounts are infulenced by things such as winning or losing. Surviving a battle. As well as individual performance. If you do nothing you will earn nothing.In terms of exp grinding you are about halfway to a tier 10 ship in amount of exp grinded once you own a fully upgraded tier 8 ship.What can you do with real money?Well the obvious and most dramatic thing you can do is buy a premium ship. This is something I do not reccommend a new player do for many reasons.YOU ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Im serious. No new player posesses the skill necessary to pull their weight in a high tier premium ship. You may get away with it with the gimmicky tier 3 and 4 premiums but this is not worth it, since the main perks of premium ships is increased credit and exp income, which at low tiers is moot as you make profit easily.PLEASE do not buy any premium ships of a tier you have never played before. You not only will be disappointed at your results and regret your purchase, but you can and will throw a game if you are high enough tier and do not pull your weight.The next thing you can buy is doubloons. This premium currency allows you to do multiple things. First it lets you convert exp earned on ships you have grinded past and allows this exp to be spend on other tech trees. Note: you still need to have played the game and have a substantial amount of exp saved in these ships. YOU CANNOT GENERATE EXP OUT OF THIN AIR WITH JUST CASH. Doubloons can also be directly converted into credits. But remember credits are useless without earning exp. Finally doubloons can be used to respec skill points put into your ship's commander, demount a placed upgrade for use in another ship without spending credits and to retrain your commander instantly when placed on a new ship. None of these actions are impossible for a ftp player it just takes time or costs an amout of credits. For example if you have a maxed out commander. You can use the excess exp as if it was already converted by doubloons.RNG elements. Dispersion as your shells leave the barrel is determined by an RNG mechanic. This mechanic is listed in port and the lower the number, the better. The number is basically saying that at your maximum range shells fired have a chance to land anywhere in an oval shaped area with a length of that many meters.This really isn't that big of a deal at all, unless you are playing low tiered battleships that have ass dispersion by design. Real life balistics on this scale of artillery were not laser accurate. They could put a shell where they wanted, mind you, but by no means were they as accurate as tanks or sniper rifles. Simply put, If you know how to aim and are skilled in leading and prediction, you can and will have a few shells hit your target per long range salvo. Medium to ideal engagement ranges, you will see most of your shells hitting. Which is pretty realistic if you ask me.As for armor and damage, That system is less realistic, but it is more consistent. Shells will do the same things under the same circumstances depending on where they hit the ship. If armor is too thick and and/or the shell isn't large enough, It will shatter and deal no damage. If the shell impacts a certain thickness of armor at an angle, and the shell isn't past a certain size, it will bounce and deal no damage.If a shell is too large and the armor of a ship is too thin, the shell will over penetrate and not have a chance to detonate it's warhead inside the target for it's regular amount of damage.Note: The above only applies fully to AP shells, HE shells have their own mechanics, but are even more consistent.The chance for an HE shell to set fire is also a random % chance as well. But most ships that need to set fires have incredible rates of fire and large shell volume so this isn't too terrible.Knowing your targets and how your shells interact with them is key to dealing damage. Otherwise you are wasting ordinance on something that isn't effective.MOBA Elements. This game is a MOBA through and through. You are on teams, Placed in an enclosed map with key areas that you need to take. There is a 2 point capture the flag mode, a 3 or 4 point domination mode, and ""epicenter"" where you have a large set of cap zones inside one another. Where the deepist zone is worth the most points.Because it is a MOBA, it is not a sailing simulator. You can and will encounter players at every tier that are playing to win and maintain their stats. Just like any online game, expect some toxic ingame chats if people have slighted each other. It can largely be ignored.I must stress PLEASE do not go into battle and ruin another players experience by not contributing, refusing teamwork, Teamkilling/damage etc. ConclusionFrom my experience this game is not near as ruined by being f2p as other games. Trust me I've played a few of those. Where literally every ingame action has a purchase option. Where if your pockets are deep enough, all content is available to you instantly. Where power creep runs rampant every month with new mechanics and items.After having dealt with the worst of the worst of f2p games, this game is absolutely nothing to worry about. Yes things will take some extra time and effort than if you invest money in the game, but paying players and free players all have to still grind a significant amount. And no amount of premium ships or economic grinding bonuses will make someone a skilled player.I reccommend this game if you want/interested in-Naval history and ships.-A competitive online MOBA played at a slower pace than most.-A free to play system that isn't pay to win.-An absolutley massive learning curve.-Are a fan of naval anime such as Kancolle, Arpeggio, or Haifuri. As there have been collabs in the past and some interesting weeb skins and mods available.";26 November, 2017;
X4: Foundations;Ygdrad;822 products in account;668 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 167.1 hrs on record;"This review is aimed at X3 fans.TLDR: This will likely be a great X game someday and worth picking up, but we're not there yet.I initially thought X4 improved on X3 in every way, but after spending some time with it and my hype dying off, I can now clearly see a few places where it falls unfortunately short. This is not a list bashing the game but feedback for Egosoft and a way for people to figure out if they want the game. Here are some issues:- Weapon variety is way down and nothing on offer is really geared towards capital ship use or feel special, it's only a few bland weapons, it's all basic fighter weaponry really. As far as I can see a gun is a gun, no size/class difference.- The map is relatively small compared to even the first X3, which had 97 sectors if i'm not mistaken, X4 has 59. It doesn't help that the highway loop is extremely fast and everything is within 2 or 3sectors of it, making it feel really small, nothing feels remote, it's like the xenons are living in your backyard. I think Egosoft leaned a little too far on the side of convenience here, they obviously haven't given up on X Rebirth's attempt to appeal to and attract a ""wider audience"".- Different factions' ship equipment seem to have stat variations but you can't see any of the stats except the main one like shield hp.- The encyclopedia lacks info for a lot of important stuff, a lot of entries are just blank.- Missiles don't show up on the radar/map, can't be targeted, don't seem to run out of fuel and will chase you even if you switch to travel mode and eventually hit you if you don't leave the system, which is very annoying for small ships that can get 1-shotted and only hold one flare. Hopefully turrets can shoot them down but seeing how they have issues hitting a ship...- The AI feels worse than in X3, it can't aim straight most of the time and is pretty terrible at managing distance/positioning. It's also way too enthusiastic about wasting all of its shields boosting away and then coming back to you before they've recharged.- Auto traders are pretty bad at the moment, even losing you money at times instead of generating profit, definitely not worth investing in. This is likely to get patched, but for now the economic side of the game is pretty busted.- You'll have to do all the exploration yourself or micromanage an AI ship since the exploration command is woefully inefficient and fails to get anything valuable done in a single sector in any sort of sane timeframe, even with the fastest ship.- The player HQ is in the middle of Teladi space so if you want to play as a pirate you can forget about it unless you keep Teladi friendly.- Haven't found or heard of any special or unique ships or variants yet so I'm pretty sure we're limited to only the 3 factions' designs.- Piracy is very limited not only due to the other issues I've mentioned, but also due to the absence of jump drives. If a ship drops its cargo(and I have yet to see any carry much value) you'll need a cargo ship to pick it up, but since you can't jump cargo ships in or out of the sector and they're slow, they're going to get intercepted by the sector's military.- It might just be a bug some people have, but the radar makes no sense, you can't use it to line up targets, rolling the ship makes it rotate on two axis instead of one for some reason.- I'm still having fun and the UI is definitely so much better than X3's, but I definitely see just how much more work the game needs now that I've had time to get used to things. Hopefully extra content won't come as standalone expansions like they did with X3.I still recommend this game because there's no doubt in my mind that if Egosoft gives X4 the same treatment they did their other games it will eventually be a gem to be enjoyed for thousands of hours. This requires giving honest feedback though, which is what I'm doing here.";2 December, 2018;

X4: Foundations;sgtspock;262 products in account;374 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 4,419.0 hrs on record;I have played Egosoft games for around 20 years, and it is now with version 6.0 that I can recommend X4. The game feels complete at this point, all the races are included (some as DLC), mechanics are better fleshed out, and the game is about as polished as you can expect from Egosoft. 6.0 brings real collision detection, which allows tighter wing formations, and an improved lighting engine, all as a free update. Players complained that carriers weren’t useful, and Egosoft listened and added new carrier commands to improve their utility. If you’ve waited to get into X4, now is the time. Please know that the nature of an Egosoft game hasn’t changed. Expect there to be obtuse mechanics which often elude reason, expect features that sound cool but don’t work, expect bugs everywhere. However, again, the game feels quite polished comparatively, but I don’t want anyone to misunderstand that the game can indeed frustrate you in stupid ways sometimes.The rest of this review is focused on what X4 actually is (or attempts to be), from my perspective:X4 is a simulation of a small galaxy filled with humans and aliens, where, with some exceptions, the economy is real, every ship has a purpose, and if you can see a ship then you can one day fly it. While X4 allows you to play it as an RTS, you are always in the game somewhere, a real person in the simulation. You can pilot any ship from fast scouts to devastating carriers and massive battleships, or you can hire pilots to fly them for you while you play admiral, or you could even get on an alien ship and allow it to shuttle you around the galaxy as it goes about its business (which is useful if you want to sneak aboard a hostile station). You start as a small fry and grow your own empire economically and militarily, eventually building your own wharfs and shipyards to field massive fleets. While there are multiple starts, usually you’ll begin in a small fighter with few credits to your name. You’ll feel a true sense of accomplishment when you buy your first trader or miner, when you get your first corvette then your first destroyer, when you build your first factory, board your first ship through piracy, etc. Then one day you’ll realize you have dozens of traders and need a system to manage them. Alas, the game grows with you and gives you the tools you need to manage your empire as you go from single ships to fleets. Ships can even be assigned to factories or even mega complexes to work for them. There are several plots which give the game not only story but modify the simulation by creating wars or peace amongst varying factions. There are pirates and an enemy common to all non-machine races in the galaxy: The Xenon. You’ll run into them as you explore the galaxy, mapping it out and laying satellites to keep track of ship traffic and trade prices. You will need to earn the trust of various factions, who keep track of your reputation within their territory. They may love you or hate you, and this is reflected in game. If they hate you too much, they will go after your traders instead of only focusing on your military. However, if they like you, they will give you discounts, sell you their stronger ships, and allow you to buy blueprints to recreate their economy for yourself. There is no winning condition… it’s a simulation after all, so you’ll usually end up playing until you meet your own personal goals. The game is highly moddable, and some would argue the game isn't complete unless it is modded. Of particular note is the Star Wars Interworlds mod, which transforms the X universe into the Star Wars universe, complete with Star Wars ships (and interiors) and sectors!All in all, there is no other game like X4 that I have found. if you know of one, please let me know.;7 April, 2023;

I'm now 10 hours into X4 and here's my early impressions - First, no bugs of any sort. Sometimes I'll get frames drop into the 20s or 30s when I've got a lot going on. I've got a 1080 ti and I'm running with everything on ultra. Had one wonky thing happen in a mission but that was largely due to me not doing what it told me to do and I just restored before I messed it up. Second, ????????? this game is deep and complex. Sure it has some tutorials but even with almost a decade of X3 behind me I still struggled to figure out how to do some stuff. That's because there's a truly stupid amount of stuff to do. If you're someone who gets frustrated easily when everything isn't super clear then take a xanax before you play X4 - but do play it. This game is what ED wants to be when it grows up. A mile wide AND a mile deep. Newtonian physics, tons of ships each of them customizable in a variety of ways but you can hire NPCs to fly everything with you. Capture enemy ships, repair them and sell them or keep them. Buy/steal/even BUILD ships, hire NPCs and set those NPCs to trading with them. build a network of satellites to track prices in different systems in this living, breathing economy and find good price opportunities to exploit but instead of having to spend your entire day being a space trucker you just pull up your 3D map, pick ships and crews for the task and say:'Hey. Bucko. Go hook up some space widgets from this system and go sell them at this station over here. Since that station makes Exploding Super Space Widgets when it's got enough regular space widgets, you just hang tight while they whip those up using what you delivered, buy those and sell them over HERE, cuz that guy? Oh man, he really, really, *really* wants Exploding Super Space Widgets.""That's maybe not exactly the menu choices you have to make but close enough.I can buy, fly, control or fight anything from tiny speedy zippy little fighters of various sorts up to massive carriers. Build fleets. Build space stations and take a direct role in the economy. Why buy space widgets when you can mine the resources and build a facility to make your own? Maybe because you don't want to play spreadsheets! Know what? Don't have to. Ever. You can start out in a tiny ship and just shoot, murder, pirate, kill loot and thieve your way into better and better ships and huge piles of space bucks because it's a ??????' sandbox, man. YOU DO YOU. IN SPACE. This game isn't a quick fix of dopamine. It's not a Candy Crush click boom get your ego pellet reward Electronic Arts title. It's a massive space sandbox, wide and deep and it's not easy or forgiving or simple but you'll play it for a decade and love it because you, you my friend, you are not the kind of person who gets told 'You've got a phone, don't you' and thinks 'Wow, yeah, I do have a phone! My gosh, I could just play all my nice, simple, dumbed down, microtransaction-riddled games on my phone! GENIUS!' You're an explorer, a fighter, a cunning trader and the kind of person who get ???? done - in fact tons of ????, all over the galaxy, all at the same time.

I bought X4 when it first released and have watched it grow and evolve into what it is today. By leaving a review I hope to persuade others to try this game. I believe Egosoft deserves praise for supporting their games with patches and listening to player feedback.I have been playing X games since X3 Reunion.X4: Foundations is for me the ultimate space sandbox.You can choose between a few game starts which give you some background information about your character if you wish to roleplay. It is important to note however that you are always free to do whatever you want and however you want, hence the ""sandbox"" part. These gamestarts merely decide with what ship you start, where in the universe and your diplomatic relations with the races.Once you start it is easy to get overwelmed by the mere options on what to do and how to do it. I suggest to simply do the tutorials. The game does a decent job of introducing basic mechanics to you. I however still feel it is necessary to search up additional guides and information. Some useful sources for guidance:- Egosoft youtube tutorial ""What is X4: Foundations?"" & other youtubers- Egosoft website forum - very helpful community and Egosoft staff actively answer and follow forums.- X4 wiki- Steam guidesYou startout with one ship and slowly amass your wealth and grow your empire however you see fit.Do different kinds of missions for the various factions, building reputation with different races gives you access to their ships and techology. Every single ship in X4 has a different interior/cockpit and it has to be said. seamlessly landing your ship and walking around on a spacestation without a single loading screen is simply awesome. From the smallest scout to the biggest capital ship, you can walk around in every single one of them. Once you get some credits you can start buying miners and traders and eventually build your own custom space stations.You can build your own space stations as you buy blueprints and modules from the different races. These allow you the produce your own wares which in turn supply the dynamic economy in the universe. Example. Factions are at war and suffer losses, this causes the faction to build many ships and in turn cause a shortage of hull parts (required to build ships and stations). You're free to shape your stations however you want, you're given the tools and pieces to use as you see fit. You're also able to import designs from other players.The expansions add more races and sectors to explore.Mod support! Egosoft is a huge supporter of mods and there are alot of them! Steam workshop makes it very easy to look up and activate mods. There is something for everyone.Manage your space empire and take over the universe.I recommend looking up X universe lore! What happened in the older X games all connects to X4 Foundations.I've merely scratched the surface here and there is so much more to talk about. If you feel curious, do look up gameplay and see if it is something for you.

I would say the game is pretty fun sub level 20. Most players have not delved into the micro-transaction store and so everyone is on a level playing field.The maps are decent (there is a large selection to pick from) and there is a good variety of game modes. My favourite game modes were ‘Storm’ which is like Rush from Battlefield and ‘Capture’ a one-life mode, capturing or defending a warhead and ensuring the attackers do not return it to their spawn. Post level 20 content is where the issues begin. Due to relatively small player base, you are forced to play with players who have many more hours than you in the game, often maxed rank players. This wouldn't be an issue usually (I'd consider myself above average in FPS games) however what sets the game back is the fact that the vast majority of these players own premium weaponry and armour which immediately ruins the competitive nature of the experience.I feel as if the premium weapons allow players significantly below your own ability the opportunity to kill you on a more frequent basis. I appreciate you are going to be killed regularly by players of various skill levels in any FPS however there is a great annoyance having been killed not having been outplayed but due to over-tuned premium items.The game does have a renting facility for premium weapons which is awarded to you upon levelling up however you cannot pick what items you would like to rent and quite often the better weapons are only usable for 1 day and the trial time proceeds to start when you click on them in your inbox, meaning you get to spend very little time with the weapons anyway.The items you can unlock by gaining experience and playing the game pale in comparison to their premium counterparts and take a long time to complete. There are a couple of ways to do this however they are either too tedious to gain a reward from (see “weapon cards” system) and/or can be immediately replaced with premium weaponry and armour.TLDR. Fairly good gunplay, decent maps and game modes but ultimately terrible P2W mechanics that ruin the level 20+ experience so I would not recommend past this point.";8 November, 2020;

Just because I rarely see people actually reading reviews, I'll just make it short for y'all.TL.DR: This game is actually garbage. Everything about it is Pay To Win. Please, I ask you kindly to never consider playing it.Now, if you wish to read more about why I'm saying that, please do continue to read. Thank you.First, and foremost, as I said, the game is Pay To Win. I've been playing this game since 2018, and I've got to say, it changed a lot in these past 3 years. For the worst, that is. When I got to play the game, it was much more fun than it is now. Now, every single lobby has Pay To Win weapons. EVERY game mode is filled with people that have Pay To Win weapon. And they sugar coat it by making stupid ??????? events with - and hear this - TEMPORARY WEAPONS. Woo! I sure love getting a weapon for a limited amount of time only to have to buy it to permanently use it. It's not that big of a deal, but the Permanent weapons have a reparation fee too. It costs in-game currency, thankfully, because that's literally the only thing that the in-game currency is useful for at this point in time. ""But what about the SHOP weapons?"" - Yes, yes you can by them. But back in the day, they were much more valuable. Now? They're actually nothing compared to the Pay To Win weapons. For comparison, if you look in the shop, to permanently buy a Free To Play weapon, you'd have to pay 99 ""Kredits"" ( the P2W Currency ). What about it, you may ask? Well, 99 Kredits is the equivalent of 1 singular dollar. And now a days, each weapon that gets released - no.. EVERY weapon that gets released is Pay To Win, and costs 20 dollars. That should put it in perspective quite nicely.""But I can still buy the Free To Play weapons, right?"" - Yes, but if you want, try to do anything with the ones you're given at the beginning of the game, compared to Billy Bob that bought a ??????? weapon that kills you if you simply look at it.There's also this thing called ""VENDOR WEAPONS"" which is just as useful as the in-game currency weapons. Not useful at all, that is. VENDOR WEAPONS are weapons you gain through playing games. Each game you get Vendor Points, and with these you unlock weapons. The more weapons you unlock, the more vendor points you'll need. And that number gets real high, real quick. There ARE some useful vendor weapons though. But they are later on, at the later levels. So have fun playing with Airsoft Guns on a real battlefield until then.Players in this game? The toxicity they emanate is so high, it irradiates your brain. They only care about winning, and they'll happily tell you to commit no life just so they could cool off. It's stupid, and they're stupid for getting this angry at a game.This game was *good* in 2018. JUST good. Now it's just getting worse and worse, going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole that is it's inevitable end. At this point, it's at Mariana Trench levels of deep.On a last point, this game also has Boxes that you can open, just like most FPS games now a days. However, I believe if I'd start opening 1000 boxes today, I'd have higher chances of falling over and dying of a panic attack then getting a single permanent weapon out of these 1000 boxes. ( Yes, the boxes can also give you Temporary Versions of the weapons you want. Or the ""Smugglers Card"" which allows you to buy the weapon from the shop, for -";26 June, 2021;

(unless ofcourse you pay)Do you enjoy playing versus hackers?Do you enjoy getting votekicked by regular players because you do not have the best score or for no apperent reason?If you can answer all these questions with a yes then Warface is the game for you!The game starts out pretty nice. There are special rooms for new members where everybody uses almost the same (underpowered) weapons and armor. For the first 30 or 40 matches your chances are fair and you might even start to like the game. When you get to lvl 13 you are placed in the rooms with the members that pay for the game and get all the overpowerd gear. From this moment on your chances will strongly decline unless you are willing to pay.I started playing back in 2015 when the game was under Crytek. The game was pretty nice back then. Updates were plenty, hackers got banned quickly and you could play the game without spending a single euro or dollar. Paying members got their stuff a bit faster, could get some nice skins and some other perks but everybody had the same chance during the game. Sinces the start of 2017 My.com took over and the game changed for the worse. (As you can see from all the negative reviews that came pouring in) First I waited patiently because a migration from one developer to another can take some time. After about 3 months into 2017 the game is becoming almost impossible to play. Warface is changing from a free to play game with chances for everybody to a free to play game with chances for those who are willing to invest fast amounts of money (id say €60 and more if you want to be able to play every class with decent weapons). Upkeep of your weapons and armor is now exceding the amount you earn from missions. Paying members are able to use these armors and weapons while the free to play members are left with and unfair disadvantege.Untill now hackers are free to use whatever hack they want. During 'ranked' matches normal players are getting carried by hackers and My.com doesnt do anything about it. If for some reason you take the time to report this to My.com they send you an automated messages trough their support system that makes it seem like they are taking your problem serious while in fact the same(!) hackers are continue playing. If you send another message to support (about the same or a different subject) they send you the exact copy paste message back. To make it all worse, there is apparently a bug or hack that grants you certain ablities (kicking, banning) to use against regular members (although i have only seen this during the ranked matches). I have reported this over a month ago to My.com and the same member is still abusing this bug today. In the more then 2000 hours I got on recored playing this game I have seen a strong decline during the last months. If you are in doubt of playing this game or if you should or should not spend money on it I would strongly discourage it.My advice would be to not start playing warface or at the very least not spend a single euro on it.Update 21-08-2018:There are still hackers in the game, a problem My.com fails to solve for over more then a year now.Update 22-08-2018:Yet another couple of hackers in ranked.;11 April, 2017;

Having played ~400 hours in total, I believe I have an informed enough opinion and can see the general direction of the game from this point having played from day 1. Flame me if you want, or tell me to post it on Reddit. I don't care, the Reddit Mods remove any posts that even remotely criticize the game.Bugs.Lots. And Lots. Of Bugs. Very few fixes and more time spent monetizing things. Plenty of other reviews have gone over a better curated list, but the most recent being bugged Suppressor levels.Roles.This game features Tank, DPS and Healing roles as a large focal point for content. Due to the nature of the game and how power is, Tank and Healers are completely irrelevant. Whales can carry and solo any content, which is nice from a F2P stand point, but really, REALLY bad for everything else. The fact that there's built in DPS meters to show you exactly how far behind you are from paid players is massively discouraging. Another problem is being a Tank or Healer (if you choose to do those roles or you get REALLY unlucky pulling) is the damage. DPS characters do amazing values, where as tanks and healers are just shafted, taking ages to kill anything even on open world at your level.Gear.Gear is basically the same as Artifacts from Genshin. If you don't know what that is, then allow me to explain. Each piece of gear can roll 4 lines from a curated list. Completely random, it means gear that is actually good for your role is hard to come by. Not including the rarity value of gear from end-game content. It's so low that it's absurd. Sure, there's a pity to get a piece, but when you use a limited resource for a sub 2% chance to drop a piece, it's not well designed.Monetization.The game started a bit monetized as all Gacha does, and considering that other games like this have paid options, the game is only becoming paid options. ""Events"" either cater to whales or spending money while the rest of the game is in shambles. The care for F2P options is becoming less and less.Events.These events... they offer amazing rewards. Let's face it, they're great. The problems being, unless you're a whale or you can manage to get on within the specific window that events run at (which is typically a few hours a day, ONCE a day) you won't be able to fill out or even participate. Outfits and cosmetics are tied to these events, making F2P options non-existent.Optional Game Modes.Much like the events with their limited time windows, Break from Destiny (Battle Royale) and PvP are tied to a limited time window to play them. They seemed to have dropped these additional game modes to keep game play fresh, but were immediately forgotten about. Really bad Lag and bugs make these game modes unplayable.Relics.Oh boy. These things are... REALLY Good actually. I can't honestly say anything bad about them. Enjoy the click bait because I really enjoy how relics work in this game and how they function.RNG.So! Earlier I mentioned Roles. This is completely random as for what roles you can get. Your pulls from Gacha dictate what you can run reasonably, and if you have terrible luck, enjoy the tank or healer life. If there was a mild way to sway RNG to go for a specific role or weapon, it'd be fine. But since most of the weapons are tied to limited banners and the basic weapons are pretty spread as for roles, you can't be sure what you get.All in all, if you enjoy this game, you do you. Keep playing and keep enjoying what the game has to offer, because the combat and exploration are actually enjoyable. Everything else is just... bad. There's a reason we get no new players. And it's not because the game doesn't have advertisements or good graphics.";6 January, 2023;

It tried to market itself as a ""Genshin killer"", but was later mocked for falling short and the surplus of bugs at launch. My playtime is much higher than Steam suggests (usually play in non-steam version). Basically I've played every day since launch. It was quite fun. Battle system is fast paced, gacha system seems fair, and for a while it seemed to fix many of the issues I had with Genshin which caused me stop playing. After playing both Genshin, I had more fun playing ToF with the the fast paced nature, even if Genshin has many elements that make it overall a better game. But here's the thing. The dev just do whatever they want and it becomes increasingly apparent the game is simply a money grab. * 99% characters are excessively big-boobed waifus. Virtually no male characters, and the ones that do exist are no longer relevant. Characters are teased and never added. * Powercreep is exponential, leaving no real incentive for investing in characters. The game launch talked some heavy game about keeping balance, but balance no longer exists. There's zero reason to A6 a character when it's lifespan is a handful of weeks and the next generation has a 40-60% gain on the previous. * After initial exploring, rewards are lackluster, especially to the cost of everything. For a game marketed as a ""f2p"", it's anything but. I don't mind the paid element, in fact I've spent several hundred. But the value of everything has decreased over time. You do get TONS of standard pulls. I'm sure i've done 2000+ from the free elements of the game, but the issue is standard characters are thoroughly useless, minus some niche situations (and needing a healing comp). * Devs decided to merge all the servers which caused splits among the playerbase. Some are happy to be able to play with friends on other servers. For many others, there's name issues, congestion issues, and language issues. World chat full of toxic players, to where it has to be fully muted and completely ignored. All sense of community is lost. There's no more recognition of a familiar face. Just a sea of faces.* Leaderboards, as expected, are exclusive to day 1 leviathans. The power difference between low end players and high end players is astronomical. The difference between high end players and leviathans/giga-whales, and whales is also astronomical, making the difference between a low end player and a leviathan laughable. * The game is expensive. Which falls back to the other points. Powercreep and low rewards disincentivize investment.I've played this game for hundreds of hours over the last year. Despite some of the technical flaws, it was a lot of fun. But the game is devolving. It no longer has it's luster.

Support if you can.if you believe after sinking hours of ur life playing their game for free and feel compel to reward the devs i believe you should pay a micro trans here and there just make sure you make a budget. and stop.... like pay for AAA game (spend 50-60 bucks) or sub to their monthly fee i think its 5 bucks a month. something along these lines will support the game (you like playing) and will keep ur pockets healthy.the devs have really made an amazing game it feels bad this is a gatcha game because i would of easiliy paid a 15-20 buck monthly sub plus AAA price tag (like wow) to be able to be competitive and have full access to the game (characters) for a 1 time fee plus sub.That being said the game has been made with love you can feel this oozing anime lore/vibes and despite being a gatcha game in my 100+ hours of playing i have not felt like i am being preyed on by micro transactions.

They are willing to help, by giving you resources, tips on how to defend, what troops to use etc. Gameplay is good, a bit slow at start, but good.But, I still cannot recommend it, because it is P2W game. People who buy cards and tokens will absolutely destroy all others. Freeroamers can survive for some time if they work together, but eventually they'll crack. I was in an really good and friendly faction where no one was buying cards, and we held for some time. Then we declared war on p2w guys. We had sent about 50 timed attacks on one village and we lost, because he was using cards to defend. After that they just devastated our faction.Apart from that, game is really addictive and fun, but P2W aspect ruined it.

This is a very addicting very parasitic game. It is completely pay to win. While it is possible to do everything for free it would take too much time. The steam version has a lot of issues with crashing so It's probably best to just download the client at strongholdkingdoms.com. I actually quit this game for some time after leading my house to win an Age then plunging it into war. If you want to be successfull in this game (in terms of leading other players) you have to have a basic understanding of politics and diplomacy. This game has tightly weaved webs in its community that can sometimes be very hard to climb. It took me most of an age to rise to the rank of House Marshal. It took rising up through the ranks of a faction within house 16. Then when I had a reputation I formed my own faction and filled it with volunteers from other factions of House 16 and the gloucestershire area.

Pros:- Throwback to Stronghold Crusader's glory days.- Brilliant combination of casual Farmville and more modern RTS games.- Endless depth.- Strategy genre enthusiasts will be amused.Cons:- Obvious freemium business model. FireFly is apathetic to its drawbacks.- Plan to play with family? Don't. You'll need to spend significant amounts of money to interact in-game, aside from joining the same faction and/or engaging in chain messages.- FireFly doesn't screen for alt accounts. As long as they get their money, players are essentially free to do whatever they please, which leads to an awful lot of treachery and deception (in turn offering unfair advantages).- Bans and suspensions are extremely infrequent. One player, reported by me, spammed several parish message boards with profanity, hate speech, and other vulgar material. He hasn't missed a day since.- This game takes an inane amount of time to progress and is far too reliant on cash investment or alliances for sustainability.- Speaking of alliances, players will find themselves thrust into the middle of warring factions or houses early on, unless they are fortunate enough to align themselves with well-off, high-ranking neutral players (who are far and few between).- Politics can be fun, but it ultimately leads to drama and senseless wasting of time. You think Facebook is dramatic? Try SHK on for size.- As each World progresses into a new Age, those worlds waste away into agonizing oblivion, later to be controlled by players who were previously shunned or spent far too long on the bottom rung and now desire to be worshipped.After investing over 3,600 hours into this game, I feel qualified enough to offer a resounding ""No"" to the question of whether or not I would recommend this game. While I cannot deny the amount of fun I've had, in SHK, the bad most assuredly outweighs the good. If you have ample cash to spend, time to invest, and love persistent drama, this is the game for you.

X4: Tides of Avarice;EverLight;210 products in account;3 people found this review helpful; Recommended 61.4 hrs on record;After 53 hours I'm starting to feel like I understand this game. I can recommend it, so long as you accept that the game has a steep learning curve to fully understand it, and you're happy to either take things slowly and ???? around, or go and study the games systems using online help. Fortunately X4 is the type of game you can just ???? around in and still feel like you had a good time and made some kind of progress. Which is pretty much what I've done for most of that time until I started to understand more of the systems. The core of the game is the simulation of the galaxy you're in. A fully functioning economy where something always comes from somewhere. This means there's always something emergent going on in the galaxy and it presents opportunities for you to play how you like.You're just a cog in this galaxy at the start and the world continues on around you as you play. You can witness events play out in first person (being on a station while its being attacked is pretty neat) or you can watch from afar. For example, two factions might be at war, and one of them destroys a facility which creates hull parts for ships, weakening that factions ability to make more ships. That's going to create gameplay opportunities for you. The obvious one is to profit more than normal by selling hull parts, but if you're not into trading you can consider mining the ore for hull parts and providing it to an allied faction, or you can help out on the front lines directly by personally joining the war with your own ship (and/or a fleet), OR you can even take advantage of the weakened faction and use the opportunity to pirate their ships more easily, or board and steal larger ships which are weakened by the battle.You have rep with each of the factions and your actions will influence how they treat you, including giving you access to exclusive ships or using their stations, or going to war with you.There's also proc-gen missions which can be taken multiple ways, which are spawned based on factors within the simulation, and come with rep and cash rewards.Plus multiple fully voice acted story campaigns which you can do at your own leisure. The game is kind of separated into two halves which play very differently but link together in meaningful ways. The first is the in-cockpit/on foot gameplay which is your typical space sim stuff. It's not as weighty as something like Elite Dangerous but it's competent enough and is more flexible in a lot of ways including ship and station interiors, EVA spacewalks, and the ability to pilot and command basically every ship in the game - including the largest capitol ships. Sense of scale is epic. You can pilot the tiny fighters or the carriers which hold 100's of them and see them on your ship ready to launch.And the other half of the game is the fleet and empire management stuff. You can recruit ships to your fleet and automate tasks, build space stations for production of items to trade (or to use yourself), build a fleet of warships, miners, traders or whatever else, and directly impact the economy with trade, production, war or piracy. This is mostly played out from the Map screen and functions a lot like an RTS or a real-time 4X game like Dune Spice wars or something.But unlike an RTS, you see your fleet actions play out in first person. For example, you can turtle up a fleet and send it into battle, while at the same time piloting one of the fighters and getting stuck in with your fleet. Or you can captain the largest ship and watch from the bridge. Or when you send in your army to board a ship, they'll launch boarding pods and you'll see them land.There's no specific requirement on how you play, so the game is super sandboxy with little direction. You can focus on just your own ship and ignore the fleet stuff and get by just fine by just taking missions/story, running trade routes, mining, piracy, etc. Or you can just sit on the Map screen and have your fleet do literally everything. I've been playing as a mixture.Your ship is the same as every other ship. It has the same health and stats as all other ships of that type in the galaxy. If you dont want to get instantly ruined, you'll need to either play smart with hit and run tactics, ally up with a faction, upgrade your ship, or recruit help.There is a lot of travel in the game which is done via auto-pilot. Which gives you the opportunity to open up the map and check out what's happening. So this is where you can dip into the fleet stuff while you wait to get from A to B.The UI in this game is pretty bad to be honest. Mainly a dense and confusing mess of menus within menus. It's the biggest weakness of the game (along with the sound design, while we're being honest), It could be better and a large amount of the learning curve will be dedicated to figuring out where game functions exist within the menus. But it can be figured out. I've found what's working for me right now is to have a handful of ships in my fleet running errands. I've got two miners selling ore and one scout exploring and collecting salvage. This is earning me enough money to upgrade my own personal ship occasionally so I'm able to take on odd jobs and missions like a freelancer. I want to build a small squad of fighters to escort me on missions as a wing, because I'm kind of weak on my own. Had an awesome emergent gameplay moment, where a mission had me scan for pirates faking their ship IDs in an allied sector. The ship in question turned out to be a destroyer class and it started ripping into my tiny fighter with turrets. Fortunately I was able to take cover behind some asteroids while the allied faction swooped in to help. I was able to shoot out some of the turrets on the underside of it, and stuck to it like glue. Eventually I disabled the engines while it was passing a nearby station, and the station turrets tore it up. When it exploded I couldn't get away fast enough, and it took out my shields and half my hull, so I had to EVA spacewalk to repair my ship. If you enjoy piloting shiops as much as giving commands, and if you enjoy sense of scale in your games, emergent gameplay and player agency, and can put up with weird UI choices, then give X4 a go.; 12 June;

Too much of it? Good luck getting collectibles cuz you will fly past them, or go way too high during a race and land where you didn't want to-The way you get upgrades... It's basically The Crew 1's way of getting upgrades, you finish a race, you get a CARD that upgrades your engine/ecu/transmisison/whatever, and it's all very RPG-like, which isn't a good thing, you basically have to wait for the performance shop to restock so you can buy better parts, you can't just go there and buy the best ones in case you have the money-Lootboxes, of course, why not, it's an EA game after all. Everyone wanted neon lights for their cars but they didn't deliver it on the 2015 game, everyone complained about it, so they added it! IN. MOTHER. F-CKING. LOOT BOXES. You basically have to open shipment crates to get a chance to get neon lights, which include colors and patterns in which they flash, along with nitrous colour, tire smoke, and horn sound, which is all cool and games until you realise you need to open lootboxes for them instead of just buying them. And the best part is? You use one of those items in your car, you can't take them off, to your inventory, you either delete them or replace them, you want to take it out and use in another car? Too bad, open more lootboxes so MAYBE you get the same neon/smoke/nitrous/horn. I bought the Deluxe Edition and I got 5 platinum neons, tire smokes, and nitrouses for free, which seemed pretty good until I realized I couldn't use them as much as I wanted because there are only 5 of each, if I use all of them, they're gone, like, forever. Such ????????-The deluxe edition doesn't come with the car pack dlc. Sure, I don't care much about those cars but, seriously? The D E L U X E edition doesn't come with all dlc? What a dissapointmentConclusion:6/10 - Need for Speed: Payback is a flawed game, it seemed to have potential, but was ruined by corporate greed. The story was okay, but enjoyable I guess. The songs were enjoyable. The car variety was enjoyable. The customization was enjoyable. Taking down The House was enjoyable. There are a couple of things in this game that make me believe that Ghost Games at least tried to deliver something decent, and it's quite unfortunate that EA had to ruin it all with microtransactions. I'm not gonna put all of the blame on EA however, some things in the game are probably Ghost's own fault, but still, the fact that this game has loot boxes, and when everyone wanted neon, they put neon in said loot boxes, shows what kind of company EA is.If you want to buy the game, wait for a sale, and try it, if you like it, then that's very good, it's not the best game in the world, and I believe it's deserving of a downvote because of EA's incompetence, but it's worth giving a try at least for me, you might get some fun out of it. I'm glad that the next game, Need for Speed Heat, is better than this one in every aspect, It's too expensive for me to buy it since I live in Brazil, a harsh country with a ?????? economy, but I hope I get the chance to play it one day. For now, Payback is the most recent need for speed I have, and although it is far from perfect, I cannot lie, it was a fun ride.I hope this was a good review. The longest one I've ever done.;23 October, 2020;
Need for Speed™ Payback;Endless;NOT INFORMED;115 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 170.1 hrs on record;NFS: Payback is full of defects, such as the boring story, highly repetitive missions, useless open world design, and annoying microtransactions. However, it is not terrible enough to get a fail score. This game contains exaggerated and cool controls, exhilarating car chasing, and fascinating background music. If you also enjoy the passionate scenes of the Fast & Furious movie series just like I do, I think you will love this game anyway.;20 January, 2021;

Need for Speed™ Payback;times.;NOT INFORMED;54 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 22.2 hrs on record;Need for Speed Payback was the EA attempt to reinvent the game mechanics with a different approach for the plot and game systems. The map is large enough( maybe the biggest of the series) to host different landmarks or landscapes,from deserts to mountains and large valleys. The graphics are muddy but still looks good at maximum settings,the cars look good and especially at night everything looks better. Payback features a day and night cycle ,beautiful roads and a decent car amount to drive . The story is told through separate chapters from the perspective of three characters each with his own perks and discipline. The plot is focused on a revenge motif to take down the House ( the organization that controls casinos,cops and the underground racing in Fortune Valley) . In terms of story,i don't expect a lot from a racing game but i was surprised they actually tried to deliver a decent story. And for the most part they did. But unfortunately also felt linear and annoying.I don't want to talk about the game ending or Lina Navarro,i'll let you discover.At first glance the cops are annoying but in a good way( they do their job as intended). This provides a tense racing experience but i wish you could escape like in previous games.. now if you reach a checkpoint towards the end of the race they stop following you and the chase ends.. That alone is a major downside for the fun factor and gameplay experience.On a closer look the game doesn't feel polish and original enough. Some elements and activities like drift zones or derelict cars are borrowed from other games . The car stealing and some cutscenes made me feel i was playing as Dominic Toretto; 22 January;

Fears to Fathom - Norwood Hitchhike;Steve;NOT INFORMED;41 people found this review helpful50 people found this review funny; Recommended 4.6 hrs on record;I logged 3.4 hours on a game which is marketed to last around 40 minutes.How did this happen? Well I'll tell you...- Immediately turned the car around as soon as the game started, so I didn't have to go home and see my overbearing father.- Collided with an invisible wall since you're not supposed to go that way.- Car flipped impossibly high into the air, landed upside down.- Car immobile, decided to walk the rest of the journey.- Continued walking for longer than I care to admit, until the road just sort of... ended. Apparently assets and sections of the game don't load in unless you're in the car.- Restarted the game, couldn't resist, went back to the invisible wall and flipped the car again.- This time it landed on its side, and I was actually still able to drive it somehow.- Scraped the car along the road on its passenger side until the game realized that cars aren't supposed to drive on their side. The car finally stopped allowing me to steer.- Abandoned the vehicle again, this time only a short walk from the gas station.- As noted before, assets don't spawn in completely when you aren't in the car, so the gas station was completely dark, there was no door, and the people were invisible. I was yelled at the entire time I was trashing the store, but I didn't see anyone, and couldn't buy gas.- Reloaded the game again.- This time decided to follow the white van that passes in the opposite lane to see where he ends up (he just de-spawns a little ways down the road).- Since I was headed the wrong direction anyway, decided to visit the invisible wall again.- Again flipped the car, this time it landed upside down again.- This time it was drivable.- Drove upside down car all the way to the gas station with no problems this time.- The gas station loaded in correctly, the lights were on, I entered, the people were there, they yelled at me as I threw every item off every shelf and onto the floor, but didn't actually do anything about it. (Cowards)- Filled upside down car with gas.- Went back in to buy dog food.- The shop keeper won't let you steal the dog food, but if you step right up to the door you can throw it outside and then exit and retrieve your stolen bounty.- Had to put dog food in the trunk, very difficult when the car is upside down and the dog food keeps falling out.- Eventually managed and went on my way.- Imagined the ear-grating sound that the car must be making as the metal roof grinds against the pavement at 40 mph as I continue my journey.- Eventual despair as the game automatically puts the car right-side-up after it breaks down.- Got hit by the pickup truck as it came to rescue me.- This all took about 3 hours, and I finished the latter part of the game in about 20 minutes. (It took 20 minutes mainly because I stopped to watch a full 10 minute episode of some Superman cartoon while I was in the hotel room.)All in all, good road trip, would hitchhike again.;18 March, 2023;

XERA: Survival;Munin;322 products in account;231 people found this review helpful45 people found this review funny; Recommended 13.2 hrs on record;XERA: Survival is a post-apocalyptic first-person shooter game developed by a single individual. The game takes place in a world ravaged by a deadly virus that has transformed the majority of the population into mindless mutants. The game presents players with an interesting and engaging storyline that provides a good framework for the gameplay.However, despite the potential, the execution falls short in several areas. The game suffers from numerous technical issues such as bugs and glitches. The game's graphics and sound effects also leave a lot to be desired, with the overall quality feeling like something out of a game from a decade ago. The lack of diversity in enemy types and the limited number of weapons available also detracts from the overall experience. One of the biggest issues with the game is its lack of content and replayability. The game can feel repetitive after a few hours, with the same objectives and enemies appearing in almost every level. There is also a lack of variety in the environment, which can make the game feel monotonous.Despite these criticisms, it's important to remember that XERA: Survival is a one-person project. The developer has created a game that has a lot of potential and ambition, but the limitations of working alone are evident. The fact that a single person was able to develop a game of this scope is impressive, and it's worth supporting indie developers who take on such daunting tasks.In conclusion, XERA: Survival is a game that has a lot of flaws and limitations. However, it's also a game that has potential and is worth playing if you can look past its shortcomings. The game's one-person development team deserves recognition for their efforts and creativity, and supporting indie developers is always a worthy endeavor. If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic games and are looking for a new experience, give XERA: Survival a chance.;30 May, 2019;
XERA: Survival;mARKY;NOT INFORMED;215 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 31.1 hrs on record;For the dev to read: The game is incredibly well optimised. It is insane to get 144fps in an early acces game. Movements feels smooth pvp as well. I love all the events (airdrop,compound event etc.). You can stash your extra gear and drop out of an helicopter to avoid players camping safe zones.Here are the cons and my suggestions:- Full servers make everything laggy- buildings feel empty and sometimes towns look the same - too many pistols in military zones- Compass should be top center of the screen. In an action game you don't have that much time to callout and looking far left for the compass is not optimal.- 1pp servers are a must. 3pp is fun but the fact that you can see people while they can't is a bit busted- light armor and heavy are too close (12% vs 18%) when helmets are perfect- Airfield feels empty- Military zones look the same- quad is too laggyI enjoyed playing a lot and i'm looking forward to the next update.;28 May, 2019;

This has happened to several players, and probably happened to many more since I stopped playing this game a few months back. In addition, he will ban you if you do anything that he disagrees with, or if he considers you a cheater despite proof of otherwise.I personally recommend not buying. It's fun for all of a few hours, but after that you're just gonna get frustrated. If not with the dev, then with the other cons of the game.Edit - For all of those asking and doubting, I made this post originally to bring light to other experiences that people have had.

XERA: Survival;Bazinga;NOT INFORMED;37 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 10.3 hrs on record;"After playing for a few hours I realize a couple of PROS and CONS about this arcade day-z looter shooter.Some things may change if you play with friends (I played Solo my first couple gameplays)PVP AND GUNPLAYThe hit reg seems alright, not bad for an early access game but the looting is so painful, having to scroll through the persons entire inventory seems very stupid and in most cases would get you killed. Guns are easy to find which I enjoy, attachments work and are very plentiful as well. THE MAPThe map is huge which in some cases is good but it makes playing very boring and lonely. Pvp interaction is pretty rare even on a full pop server. Most of the cities have copied and pasted buildings and contain very little loot making going there an extreme waste of time.THE AIProps to them for not using zombies and having their own unique thing, but there is very little Ai interaction adding on to the loneliness of the game.I didn't even know there were any other A.I other than robots until I was looting and heard gunshots coming from a ""bandit"" that seemed to be the only thing that was in the city.BASE BUILDINGAfter rounding up a couple of tools that seemed to be needed for a proper base build I decided to try it out. I feel like this could be easily fixed but WHY is it so hard to find a spot to build a base. Not even kidding I spent almost an hour running around the map trying to find an area to build.- When I finally found a decent spot to build i placed down the flag thing and got to building. I personally dont really mind the building and individually placing down each base frame but I feel it requires so much grinding to get even a simple 1x1 set up. Traps and Turrets are very cool addition either buying or finding the parts to craft one. Overall its very easy to understand but just really inconvenient in some cases.EVENTS I like the constant events going around the map like Airdrops and Helicopter crashes. It really spices things up and gives the player something to do other than just looting and killing other people. These events provide very good loot and gives a very big challenge to people.Overall id give this game a 6/10 its not the best, but its not the worst either. Fun game to hop on if you are looking for an arcade looter shooter similar to H1Z1 Just Survive (games a mix of Dayz and Rust)This is my first real review on a game so if there is anything I could improve please leave a comment.";24 October, 2021;

During the day, players can participate in legal races to earn money, which is essential for purchasing and upgrading vehicles.

Palm City is beautifully rendered, with neon-lit streets and diverse locales that enhance the immersion. The sound design complements the visuals, featuring a soundtrack filled with energetic tracks and realistic engine sounds that heighten the racing experience.Pros:Engaging day-night cycle that alters gameplay dynamicsExtensive car customization optionsResponsive and fun arcade-style racing mechanicsStunning graphics and immersive sound designThrilling police chases add intensityCons:Storyline is somewhat clichéd and predictablePolice AI can sometimes be overly aggressive or inconsistentRepetitive race types can lead to a feeling of grindConclusion:""Need for Speed Heat"" successfully revitalizes the franchise by blending classic street racing thrills with modern enhancements. The day-night cycle, extensive customization, and dynamic police chases create a compelling and varied gameplay experience. While the story may not break new ground and some AI issues persist, the game's strengths lie in its exhilarating races and the freedom it offers players to craft their own racing identity. For fans of the series and newcomers alike, ""Need for Speed Heat"" delivers a satisfying and adrenaline-fueled ride.Rating: 8/10"; 14 June;

Retrowave World;Tenfold;NOT INFORMED;10 people found this review helpful; Recommended 25.2 hrs on record;Early Access Review 14 May 2024The game has a ton of potential and the devs are always listening and responding to people. At the end of the day the devs are making a game in their image and you either roll with it or you don't support it. I would do the same exact thing and I can respect that.Lets start with the some cons.1.) Lots of bugs. I'm supporting the game in it's state buy purchasing it on the ground floor and contributing by notifying the devs of the bugs I see as well as anyone else who supports them.2.) Some stuff feels unpolished like actions of punching and kicking but again I'm sure this is the foundation laid for something better in the future.3.) Camera is a pro and con for me. Con part is as stated by many getting in and out of your vehicle it tends to be annoying swinging your camera to a different view point but I am certain they are hammering this situation out. Pro part of the camera, when driving you can change to multiple views like watching a racing replay of you driving down the street but its real time. Pretty nice camera angles while driving and I can see people making some good content with it.4.) Not a whole lot to do for someone who picks this game up and wants to play 12 hours straight. Don't expect tons of different things at the moment but it's also not empty. There is foundations laid out all over the place for future content. Again, why I support them with my purchase and contributing information.Pros1.) It's playable. I haven't had any game crashes and the worst part of the game I have encountered myself is not being able to interact with an NPC and having to reload into the server which takes like 30 seconds. Not a big deal.2.) The art work is fantastic. Loving the 80's theme and can't wait to see more cars added.3.) Multiple maps. At least 3 that I have went to so far and just cruised around looking at things and trying to interact with whatever I could dive my avatar into. (No pool pun intended) but there is a pool!4.) Arcade life! Yeah there is a whole arcade with Yakuza style gameplay feel of going into an arcade and throwing basketballs or ski ball or even shooting some monsters up.5.) Casino life! You want to run to a blackjack table or roulette or just a slot machine it's all there at your own risk.6.) You can buy real estate (again Yakuza style feel) then gain passive income off of that. It needs polishing for sure and I hope they actually can add real housing or something later that would be awesome.7.) Vehicle customization and tuning. There is the foundation for this and its very simple right now nothing complex but you can paint your car and add some horsepower to it. Hopefully this also gets more detailed in the future and we have something similar to The Crew or BeamNG who knows.9.) Delivering pizza is not so much a pro for me or a negative this is why its here at the bottom. It's OK. It works right. It's a way to gain money and something to do taking on random pizza deliveries. You have to be fast of course. I still do it sometimes since its an achievement. This is all I got for now. I might come back here and re-review this. I figure they could use more reviews since they don't have a publisher to do any advertisement work for them (that I know of).; 14 May Earl;

Dooon’t do it.First, they’re treating you like brainless cattle. It’s NOT free DLC, you’re downloading nothing new. All it does is let you start with a level 35 Time Tracer (Very low level) and give you a bunch of TIMED cashshop goodies (They pretend that’s worth money, hence the ‘free’ part). That. Is. All. Nothing new or unique.You’re not cattle to be milked like KOG loves to believe, don’t fall for this ‘free DLC’ ????????.And back to the review….First - Cashshop.It's a free to play, sure, but it fails absolutely miserably at handling its cashshop. Power, not convenience, is for sale. Just take a look at what you'll want for a new character:Want to use more than 4 skills at once? 9$Ditto items? 6$Want a costume (greatly boosts PVP stats)? Anywhere from 15-32$Do you want skill notes (greatly boosts skills)? 1.50$ a piece, can use up to 6Want an overpowered pet? 4$Want an overpowered mount? 23$That's 60$ for a huge power boost nearly unobtainable ingame. In other words, apparently this game is so awesome, a single character should cost more than the price of a triple A game (Surprise, it’s not). That’s not even touching the hundreds of dollars you can spend going for overpowered +11 equipmentThat alone should be giving you bad vibes, but to continue…Second - Balance.Short version: There is none.Long version: Sigh… KOG's idea of new content is a new, more broken character. That way people will go ""AWESOME"" and pay $60+ in previously mentioned cashshop for their new broken character.And then they release another, even more broken character, and repeat the loop for infinite money. New dungeons? Nope, halt the update and add another new character instead.Let's look at the most recent, broken example, Add, or specifically the new Diabolic Esper class coming out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLeq6Lo2HEY (30 second clip, implore you to take a gander)Yes, that is Crimson Avenger, -second- newest class, dying in 30 seconds while DiE literally just runs around spamming missiles. Mind you, this is SSS rank play, top tier stuff. Welcome to Elsword PVP.Ignore the most broken cheapskate for a second, as even the basic combos are horribly unbalanced. Eve in general is incapable of looping without spamming Tesla Shock, the worst KD reset skill in the game. Ara and Add have built in infinite loops with their basic attacks. If they catch you once, you will die without manabreak. That means anytime they catch you, it's a guaranteed -100 MP for you, while Eve will end up doing scratch damage while -giving- you MP. It’s completely unbalanced at the most -basic- level, before even delving into class skills and powers.So if KOG can’t even balance the most basic and -important- aspect of a fighting game, what hope is there for the rest of the game?Third - Combat.So there's PVE and PVP. Originally both took skill to be good at....Not anymore.With the last dungeon revamps we had ages ago, everything's been buffed with fake difficulty. Bosses ignore combos with length super armor while hitting chunks of your HP off, or get ???????? like flat out invincibility/smaller hitboxes.Even the normal mobs are getting stoic counters to break free from your combos. Because ????, what is this, a fighting/combo game? Oh, it is? Well oops.The end result is that the game is becoming more and more like a maplefest game. No skill, just button mashing and potion chugging, spam your highest damage move whenever the CD is off.So what about PVP?You can probably guess how this’ll go.As should be evident with the cashshop and balance sections, PVP is ????. Doesn’t matter how skilled you are, if you picked the wrong class/don’t have as much cashshop as everyone else, you lose. They only need to be slightly competent to floor you.But assuming you're equal in everything, class, cashshop, how's it go then?Laughably. This is a terrible excuse of a fighting game.99% of PVP is catching, which is hitting your opponent first so you can combo them. The actual combos are brainless, you memorize a small string of button inputs and that's it. You repeat that forever and you know PVP. Catching is the only hard part, which naturally gives the edge to the players with more range. Guess who everyone picks.Look at Add, newest character. Starts match with DP mode, spams nearly undodgable homing shot, teleports into you for combo, never runs out of DP unless he kills you enough. Nothing counters it.But even ignoring Add, this game is still a joke compared to other fighting games. There’s almost zero strategy involved beyond picking the right character.Fourth - ContentThis is probably the final nail in the coffin for me. KOG literally couldn't give less of a ???? of what the players want. We haven't had real new content in almost a year now. Our current endgame is summed up in 5 dungeons, the Secrets. You only run them to construct a Secret set, which takes at most a month. Then you have nothing else to do but PVP. Congrats, you won Elsword.This is yet another ploy to make you make another character and spend even more on cashshop, but considering how boring it gets to play the same things over and over… that won't last long.You could try to argue PVP is the heart of the game, but as I've tried to make clear, it’s terrible. Even the rebalances are jokes. Season 3 revamped a total of TWO out of 26 classes, and completely ignored (and even NERFED) classes desperately in need of it, like Code: Nemesis again.Not to mention, again, the complete lack of cashshop separation from power. Expecting nerfs to costumes, +11 weapons, skill notes, etc? What is this, a balanced F2P?So yeah, PVP is the ‘heart’ of Elsword, and it’s rotten to the core.Fifth - Regional differencesI mentioned them a bit already, but it goes a lot deeper. If you play Elsword in KR, it might actually be somewhat better overall. Anywhere else? ???? you.So what does NA get? Summed up in a few words: Cashshop, inflated prices, worthless trinkets.Meanwhile KR gets so many EXP boosting events, crossover events, fun little stuff like Bingo events, even a month long Harmony festival with cashshop rewards/costumes/exp boost/stamina boost/free healing items/and more all rolled into event that's still going on. We don't get anything like that anymore.So tack that on top of the already increased EXP requirements and bland general events.But wait, they also purposely punish our region for no reason!In KR, Henir and Secret revamps came with new level 70 sets, could trade your old 60 sets for them. In NA, all the work you put in the 60s? Do it again. Make 70s from scratch with the vastly inferior 60s in dungeons designed for much stronger equipment.We can't even get voice acting yet, we're still using KR's voice overs, while even the UK managed to get English dubbing (Which was horrible in quality because KOG isn’t going to waste money when they could pocket it).Our GMs do make an effort to have silly mini-events, but they're powerless against the greedy grubby hands of KOG.And this is all because the MMO market anywhere else aside from KR is pretty slim. KOG can tell us to eat ???? and we have to, because we don't have many other options.Which is why I eagerly await DFO's return, KOG is about to burn their own ship with this ????.------------------Hopefully you’ve got the gist of that and now understand what’s wrong with Elsword. Pleeeease avoid it, KOG doesn’t deserve a penny from you. Tell your friends, too, don’t let them waste time or money on this crap.There are far better ways to spend your time and money than this game.";7 October, 2014;
Elsword;Emmory;109 products in account;143 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 2,666.7 hrs on record;"Elsword the game with a unique charm similar to Smash Brothers, but with the faulty advertisements of a dedicated fighting game. In terms of specs to run this game, you can nearly hop on any computer and start playing.You join the game, select your first character. A unique cast that charms you by the beauty and elegance of their fighting styles and chibi-like looks. As you start off you may go on solo or with your new found playmates. From the combination of side-scrolling gameplay like in Mario Brothers, and light and heavy attacks similar to Smash Brothers you may be fooled into believing it's a fighting game.But sadly the more you attempt to play arena, the more you attempt to hone your skills, the more you attempt to dungeon, the more you attempt to strive to become stronger in PvE or PvP. The more you quickly realize how difficult it is to get by without throwing your cash at this game. But with a few hours to spare you want to experience the full experience, the challenging experience. So you press on without spending a single dollar.So with a keen interest in PvP you begin. You begin to practice and practice and practice. You go from a nobody to a noticeable foe. Practicing in spar rooms, and taking on the dangerous Arena. With your technical skills honed you realized, this isn't a fighting game. It's a beat-em up game. And despite your efforts you get trumped time and time again by simple tricks which you have no counterplay to.So with all the pain and suffering, you think maybe you should pursue this ""gear"" everyone talks about. So with your technical skills honed to perfection you struggle onwards.With hard work and much grinding hour by hour, day by day, you've accomplished difficult feat for Elsword. You've spent hours doing daily quests leaching off the ""strong"", and doing event quests acquiring much needed assets to your ""gear."" You've done it you're fully accessorized and you even look pretty damn good.Gear the major determining factor to your stats, you've increased your stats to your ideal, using your RPG knowledge you've put it together like a puzzle. Each piece that took you hours upon hours of your time and effort.Now with your new found power you are respected for your clear speeds in dungeons, your friends respect your hard work and your power. So you tackle PvP once more.Now you have become what you thought was impossible to defeat, you have become one of the ""strong."" Only to be hated in PvP. Only to give your opponent the experience against fighting impossible odds, with little to no counterplay. You soon find yourself bored time and time and time again. You've honestly done all you've wanted in your solo adventure, with your free2play spirit in a harsh monopoly of a pay2win game.So you think back and ask yourself. ""What have a really accomplished?"" I've made friends along the way I see them come and go. Your closest friends have quit the game. The community dwindles to near emptiness at night. When the community is awake the topics is always the same. Complaints about the game, complaints about PvP. When someone asks you to teach them you simply laugh and show them the one trick that works 9/10 games. When you try to style your combos many will not notice and only few veterans will praise you. You've reached a level of strength that one would not think is possible without spending at least a couple hundred dollars.""Is there something more? Is there something more to experience?"" You ask yourself. With only the feeling of empty accomplishment and many regrets. ""Did I actually enjoy playing?"" Yes, yes you did for awhile. But soon it became a disappointing grind everyday, soon it became a hassle a simple desire to see how far you can push the limits. At times you showed anger, frustration, and then you took it seriously and in the end... You've hurt your friends, and you've hurt the one that you held dearest to you, a game taken too seriously.So you decide to slow down, you decide to see ""What more does this game offer?"" Taking the time to sit down and read and watch the story. Reading up on the lore. You quickly discover the plot is incoherent, sometimes unfinished, misleading, counter-intuitive, but comedic and random.With so much hours put into this game, with many accomplishments one after another. Sadly this is the disappointment in the end.This is my lonely and disappointing adventure in Elrios, in the game of Elsword.----------Despite this. You log on, to talk and meet old friends that still have stuck with you for all this time. This is the true value you found. Even despite the poor community lacking knowledge, patience, or trust. You've found a few friends worth keeping, and I think that's true in any MMO if you play long enough.Until the day I leave a small dent, or even a small mark in another game I hope there's much more beautiful things to see.With all that all I can say about Elsword is... Much potential entertainment led astray. Community exhausted by their love of the characters despite the harsh reality of the game. Because the beauty and personality in the art and in the characters were shown greatly. But the poor leadership, organization, and excution of the game led to a very disapointing effort.Thank you for all the good, the bad, and the worst times I have ever experienced playing a game. A heartwreching, heartbreaking experience combined with a false caring of your efforts. Even if there's a few moments that are pure gems.";16 November, 2016;

I love this game but from a player safety and trust/moderation perspective, I cannot in good faith give this game a positive review.I was doxxed during a ranked match and I had to try for almost 2 days to get ahold of someone from BMG to handle the issue. Come to find out, they didn’t even permanently remove this player, they gave him a 30 day ban. A 30 day ban for a ranked player when we are less than a week out from offseason. Boy, that’ll really show him, banning a regular ranked player during the one month he can’t play because the mode is disabled! Apparently finding my personal information, naming themselves as my real life manager in-game and repeatedly saying lines during the match pertaining to posts about my workplace isn’t a serious enough offence despite this specific player already having 3 punishments on record. This specific player also persistently abused a community made mod to find me while I was anonymous, to the point where I had to contact the guy who made it to ask for it to be amended, and also admitted to other players on Discord that he did find and use my information - but “it was fine because her profile was public”. Reasonably I know BMG cannot moderate Discord messages but this player has continued to give my full name and workplace out to other people via Discord DMs, further proving he has very little remorse. But no, we welcome people like this back with open arms after their cold hard time in off-season jail.Doxxing is a cybercrime which these guys don’t seem to care about. Sorry BMG, I’ll make sure it’s my full home address and IP next time. Maybe then it’ll be “serious enough” for you.Stay very very clear if good moderation is something you value.; 14 May;

Town of Salem 2;Turmoil;NOT INFORMED;486 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 301.3 hrs on record;"EDIT: I am coming back to this review to update my opinion on the game overall. They recently made Town of Salem 2 free to play, and while this understandably upsets a lot of players who paid the full $10 price tag, I feel as this is a great way to breathe some new life into the game and attract more players.I really enjoy playing Town of Salem 2, as I enjoyed playing its predecessor. However, despite this I find myself unable to recommend this game to most people. Unless you are a veteran ToS player, or are simply a fanatic for social deduction games in general, this game is probably not for you. In this game there are a significant amount of abbreviations, roles and factions that one must familiarize themselves with in order to play this game properly. The community, as well as the gameplay itself is incredibly unforgiving to mistakes or lack of knowledge, even when it comes to the most minute details. ToS 2 has a number of new roles and is generally (in my opinion) more complex than its predecessor. Fortunately there is an option for new players to familiarize themselves with the game in the form of Classic Mode.At times the community can be quite toxic, especially in more competitive gamemodes such as Ranked Practice. This is ultimately just a part of competitive games in general and this is especially true for social deductions games, but for many people the toxicity is a huge turn-off. One of the most drastic changes made to the overall gameplay was to attempt to shatter the ""jailor meta"" in which a powerful role would reveal themselves and the rest of the lobby would just play protect the president with the powerful player until eventually all the evils are snuffed out over time. Now there are a couple new roles that specialize in killing 'revealed' players by matching their role to their name and its likely these roles were added to help shake up the meta. Despite this, there are a significant number of players who still think they're playing ToS 1 and will vehemently try to bring this meta back and will even push to lynch players that refuse to follow through with their outdated mindset. In addition to this, it is almost ALWAYS expected of investigative roles to IMMEDIATELY reveal themselves on the second day, regardless of how vulnerable it makes them, and if you claim mere SECONDS later than all of the other investigative roles, you can kiss your ass goodbye. It can be truly frustrating to work against players that INSIST on sticking to a specific gameplay style with no refusal to switch things around. One of the saddest parts of this game is how dead it is. ToS 2 almost NEVER has more than 1000 active players at any given time. This, coupled with the playerbase being split off into different gamemodes of choices oftentimes means that you end up playing with the same people over and over and over again. I understand that this is a pretty niche genre (barring stupid games like Among Us) and that this kind of game is not everyone's cup of tea, but the lack of a solid playerbase means you have to deal with long wait times in lobbies as well. I say this because I really enjoy the game and I want it to have more players. In a game like ToS, there is nothing more important than having actual real people to give your game life. At the moment I fear this game is at risk of dying just as Traitors in Salem did. Lastly, I believe the game's LARGEST barrier to entry is its price. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to pay $10 for this game, as I understand it is a HUGE visual upgrade from the original, but at the end of the day any and all visual changes are irrelevant as the gameplay loop simply boils town to point-and-click Werewolf, and for that $10 is a pretty significant price to pay for a lot of people. I strongly believe a price reduction is necessary to bring more players into the community, which is a regrettable thing to say because I do want the devs to profit well from their work.Ultimately I really have been enjoying my time with this game, but as stated previously, I am a veteran Town of Salem player and I have reason to believe that a MAJORITY of the currently ToS 2 playerbase are also here because they loved the original. I struggle to see how any new potential players can become interested in this kind of game, especially when it is more complex than the last. This review may sound harsh to some, but I say these things because I generally love and care about this game and its community, and I would like to see it as well as the folks at BlankMediaGames succeed. I know that this game is still in early access and a lot of aspects of the game are subject to change. I am completely open to changing my opinion and I cannot wait to see what changes will be brought about by the release of 1.0. Either way, I cannot comfortably recommend to this game to anyone who doesn't already LOVE the Town of Salem games or social deduction games in general.";6 August, 2023;

All any is now even less fun. Instead of being a wacky 3 way with cool neutrals, it's now 1v1 (with occasional horseman but there's only 4 and all VERY powerful) with some neutrals.- The UI is HORRENDOUSLY BAD. It is MASSIVE, with no UI scaling. Things like will and death note are hard to find because they made it an OBJECT instead of a very visually contextual symbol like TOS1. It is also very cartoony and distracting, it's hard to focus on anything because it's so damn bright and plastic-looking.- It's very zoomed in on the map, which compounds awfulness with the massive UI. What's the point in customization if you can only see such a small portion of the map, that you can't zoom out?- The house interior is terrible. I would like to see the map during the night, not a blank room that I can... Wander around in. I want to look at other people's customization!- The chat automatically closes during cutscenes. I'm trying to read at all times, it's a game based on reading other people's texts.- Short times on everything. It barely feels like you can get a sentence out before it's time to vote to trial! Much less think about your next moves or claims.- Weird UI scaling decisions. Why is the important information SO SMALL, while the useless information and decoration SO BIG? You can barely see how much time you have left during a cycle because it is SO TINY!! That, and chat text size is BIG on the smallest setting! I don't want to scroll so much. You have to fit 15 people into a chatbox that can only hold like 5 messages. It's hard to find information you need in a reasonable amount of time because of the weird scaling.- SKINS! WHY. I don't want a recolor of the same character I have, and even if I preferred it over the character, I'd still have to BUY THE CHARACTER to get the skin! What is this, Overwatch? Apex Legends?------ Fixes --------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is what I'd do, if I could, to fix the game:- Add mafia back in limited gamemodes.Perhaps ""classic"" ToS1 CAA with the new roles and reworks, where mafia is a fun option and it's not always clearly cut Coven v Town. The rest doesn't have to have mafia, but I'd like to have them back and have fun with them.- Return Invest and Ret back to their original abilitiesRet should be able to bring one person back to life. It felt actually useful and you had a confirmed town around, Ret was actually useful! And invest should give roles again.- Add UI scaling, smaller text options, and a bigger font-size time counter at the top.- Option to use a ToS1 UI.It's very hard to focus or pay attention, it's so bright and disorienting. It'd be nice to use ToS1 UI. Simple, no-nonsense, small, and GOOD. There was no need to change it.- Return to the original will, death note, notepad, and paste will icons. It's hard to find them each time I need to access them because the visual context of the symbols is WAY harder to understand in a shorter amount of time. I don't want to think about finding my will, I want my tan brick that I know damn well is my will. That, and the paste will button is not square and no longer visually contextual either.------ Verdict ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Considering it's $8, I couldn't in good faith recommend this game over Town of Salem 1. Should they fix the UI and cycle timings, it'd tip-toe slightly over the edge and I'd recommend it. It'd be ideal everything here be fixed, but I can settle on UI and timing.--------- Dev response & Clarification -------------------------------------------------For the first time in my life a thought has gone through my brain. Neurons fired and there is still a glimmer of hope that I have a brain- I understand why the Invest rework happened, as much as I don't like it. But I won't hold it against them.- As for house interior critique, I understood walking around at night as an issue. I had an idea of perhaps not seeing other players during the night, or having a zoomed-out view, akin to ToS1, where I could see people's houses (And maps if they will be added)- Customization. Sometimes you have to admit you're wrong, and perhaps it's better to focus on polish than customization. Excited to see new ones, though, hopefully without the skin system.- Please add taunts I want defiled (Although, I see the issue in implementing it)- The dock at the bottom doesn't make much sense to me. In ToS1 you could click buttons around the screen to see the tabs you want to see, and collapse and expand them as you wish. The bottom dock comprised of three REALLY important buttons, the will, notepad, and deathnote, very plain to see and alone at the bottom. I take the addition of the tab expand/collapse buttons being there as... Weird. And the decision to put the will, dn, and notepad in the middle->right and as non-contextual objects. Just make it an open will, notepad, and bloody note like ToS1? It doesn't get more contextual than that.- I have to admit some are personal changes I'd like, like smaller text size, but I'd like to have the option instead of ""Medium"", ""Big"", and ""Really big""";26 May, 2023;

Beam Eye Tracker;jijun.ecnu;NOT INFORMED;19 people found this review helpful; Recommended 9.6 hrs on record;"For DCS, it works, but you'll have to tweak it. Here is what I've discovered: 1. Head tracking is all you want. Eye tracking makes you dizzy. Because when it tracks your eyes, the whole environment (cockpit) shifts slightly. The ""picture"" stays the same when eyes roll in the real world.2. In the settings, you need to lower the Head Tracking Filter to 30% from the default 50%. Otherwise, you will feel a significant delay in the game.3. In Opentrack, you need profiles for DCS. If a profile specifies a device other than Beameye, open it with a notepad and delete the line with the device name. I downloaded two profiles from the DCS forum. One of them specified a PS3 camera. After deleting the line in that profile, it worked, but not perfectly.4. When the Beam and Opentrack worked up in DCS for the first time, the distance from the HUD felt like your face was pushed against the gun sight. Setting the z distance to 75cm in mappings fixed the problem.5. The last problem was jittering in the z-direction. I observed the HUD jitter back and forth for about 1cm. Setting the Deadzone to 0.15 in the Options->Filter page solved the problem.I hope the developer will make the Beam Eye work for DCS more smoothly, providing an out-of-the-box experience. It will sell like hotcakes. In my opinion, this software tracking reaches 87% of the usability of the AimXYZ solution."; 8 April;

If you download it through Xbox Game Pass, you can also use the downloaded files through the launcher on the Steam version if that is how you want to go about it later on. The sim itself is fantastic and I feel that it was well worth the wait. I'll update this with a full review later on when I get more hands on experience with the simulator.----Updated Full Review as of 2020-08-20After testing the simulator for a fair bit of time, I wanted to give my inputs on how I feel about the simulator. Microsoft Flight Simulator graphically speaking, is simply the best we've had in a flight simulator. For the longest time, clouds rendered in simulators like P3D or X-Plane 11 were 2D and flat (albeit now P3D has TrueSky which significantly improves their clouds) but with FS2020, we are finally able to get an overhaul to one of the most significant problems in flight simulation. The weather system is great but has a flaw that I've seen. The METAR will sometimes be outdated by 1 hour and show weather that is not representative of what the weather actually is at a certain airport. It can sometimes be significantly behind or sometimes be accurate to the weather currently at an airport but hopefully with time, these issues will be sorted out with their weather provider meteoblue. The gusts however are great with the frequency being shown and able to be adjusted. Gives the wind a more ""alive"" feel.The aerodynamics have been improved from the days of FSX and P3D. In those sims, it felt as if you were on rails. The aerodynamics are not comparable to X-Plane 11 which I feel has the better flight model (though it does feel too exaggerated). Flying in the third person camera however feels kind of arcade-like which is dislike but I enjoy flying more in the cockpit than I do flying in the third person camera. I feel the aerodynamics will need some work done on them as planes tend to be tail heavy in my experience with them pitching up too much upon touchdown.The biggest selling point to the game in my opinion is the use of satellite imagery and AI to create autogen. The ground scenery is some of the best ever seen in a flight simulator to date. It uses Bing Maps which is not as good as Google Maps in my opinion but it does the job well enough to make for a realistic experience.Some of the aircraft have problems with autopilots not functioning correctly, missing features in the GPS systems such as in the G1000 where it can make it difficult or near impossible to fly with them on networks like PilotEdge or VATSIM, and just general performance issues. They look really nice but don't have the greatest functionality but they are just default aircraft so it is to be expected that not everything works in them. They should however, try to make really good avionics. Kind of like how X-Plane 11 has a fully functional G1000, GNS430 and GNS530 avionics systems as they work really well and are included by default. Most payware planes will end up using the default avionics and having strong base avionics is a must in a simulator in my opinion.The biggest problem I have with the simulator is how buggy and unoptimized the simulator is. I feel that the simulator needed more time to be ironed out with the bugs (such as not being able to click anything in the cockpit upon loading it up) and the performance issues (only 50% gpu usage in the A320 cockpit, glass cockpits suffer hard on performance). The game really needs you to have a beefy computer to run it optimally. The best place to test your performance is in a major city like JFK.Overall, I'm enjoying the simulator and love to just fly around with my friends and do FSEconomy flights here and there. It is an enjoyable experience so far and with the team wanting to support the game for a long time, I have hope that many of these issues will be fixed.";18 August, 2020;

It's much, Much better than it was at launch, and with each Sim Update you have a bit of frustration depending if they focus on PC, or on Xbox as for reasons, when they attempt to focus on patches for one, it breaks the other, but coming past SU9, I feel they are continuing to be on the right track and little by little, the game continues to get better and better.You have read it all before, the Graphics are between good and downright fantastic. This is at the moment, the only game on my system that is the main push for me to build a new PC just to play it. Sim Update Performance improvements have helped quite a bit, but the draw of VR/4K gaming even with a 3090, demands a better CPU and my pretty much ancient X79 based system just isn't enough for this game alone. Even the most recent chip from AMD, the 5800X3D showed that the game Loves CPU Cache, and will use as much as you can get it. Zen 4 is on my radar to be the next big step for getting that bottleneck off the CPU.Sound is another thing that MSFS does really well at times. Most of the stock planes sound great, and most of the time, a quality 3rd party plane does put some fantastic effort into their audio as well. (PMDG's DC-6 and the Wing42 Boeing 247D are two of my absolute favorites for Radial Relaxation.) When the planes sound good, it really helps nail the experience more than just pretty graphics alone.VR finally came to the game, and with one of the best implementation using the OpenXR system. Being able to hot swap between 2D and VR on the fly is something many other games should adopt. And if your system is powerful enough for it (Hah, like one truly exist yet with current CPU tech) the game looks amazing maxed out while in VR. The first time I loaded up in the Just Flight Arrow in VR, I could swear I could smell the plane as it was exactly as I would be in a real one many times before. There is still plenty of work to be done for VR. The VR Controls continue to need work and adjustment as well as 3rd party support, but when they can finally get to the point that you can just click, rotate, pull, etc all the cockpit buttons, dials, and levers in VR, it will be an absolutely amazing experience. For now, it is still extremely good, and will continue to get better as technology and the systems improve.Flight Model is something that some people may love, some may hate, some may like for some plane and not others, some may say X-Plane/P3D/etc does better. For a Sim and a Game, MSFS has nailed a pretty solid representation of how it feels to fly most planes. They are continuing to improve it immensely with added physics and aerodynamic model improvements and again, the game continues to grow and improve over time where the physics will inevitably follow. On the smaller planes, things are quite close to real life comparing to my real world experience, larger birds seem to be pretty close as well depending on the ones you are flying and how much you trust the Weather systems effects on the plane as well. Is it Perfect, no, but I do feel that over time it can be made as simple, or as true to life as one may want and has the CPU performance to emulate down the road.Weather is another thing that while its had it's fair share of bugs and goofy issues, when it does work correct, it really does add to the immersion factor of the game and gives you the true sense of flying in something other than a clear calm blue sky. Hopefully it can be expanded to truly emulate hurricanes and other more extreme weather, but for now, being able to fly a little Cessna into a Hurricane during the season is kind of fun for something you would never want to do in the real world.Gameplay is something that at the present system, is possibly lacking to those that are either a little unfamiliar with Flight Sims of this type, but also a lack of implementation ingame that at least for the time being, is being somewhat provided by third party services to add a form of ""Campaign"" or ""Career"" mode. My personal favorite is Flight Sim Economy (FSEconomy), and The Skypark from Orbx. The Skypark gives you some fun and adventurous routes to fly in all sorts of interesting parts of the world, and has a extremely slick app and interface design that works really well. FSE is a much more dated interface and system, but has a lot more depth for things like the world economy, the ability to own and rent/lease planes, maintain and service them, and even run your own FBO network. It too will take you to many different parts of the world but you do have to make your own goals for what you want in the long run, like any open world career sim would. It would be nice if MSFS eventually adds its own sort of Career/Campaign mode that interacts directly and deeply within its own systems, and eventually I believe it will happen, but for now, outside of the lack of marketing/exposure for many of these alternate 3rd party solutions, the ones that are out there do scratch the itch pretty well at least for now.The Download System many have complained about, and it sounds like Steam actually dodged the bullet compared to the Windows Store version that has even harder times getting patches to apply on Sim Update day sometimes, but I personally, spread between multiple completely separate PC's in my house, have had no issues whatsoever downloading/reinstalling the game or updating when patches are released. Good internet is a must but you will never max out your bandwidth as even with Gigabit, the game does seem to top out at around 200-300Mbit and then since it does handle one file at a time, is at the limit of downloading that file, extracting and processing it, and going onto the next which is a very slow and linear process, and being the game is near 200G at this point, does take time no matter how fast your PC/Internet/etc is. When it all works though, it does eventually finish and works fine at least for me. One big thing that I think even a few Xbox users are missing is when you do download an update or even after first install, you do have to go to the Package Manager under your profile tab, and ""Select All"" and download all those updates as well, especially after every patch, to update all the other packages not part of the main core game. If you don't do that, you will be missing a lot of content and fixes that could cause the game to crash if it's not updated after a Sim Update. The whole separate system like this is very silly I completely agree, but once you grasp it, it works, just very clunky and slowly, but it does, work...Controller support for the game is very good, one thing I do hope to return in due time would be Force Feedback support as when you have that working, flying a plane really does feel real as you feel the resistance of the air against the control surfaces. And the game supports many of the current, past, and probably future sticks, yokes, gamepads, etc and has customization options galore. One of my favorite devices to use however for quick flights without having to swap in/out the whole Joystick/Throttle/Peddle setup, is using the Steam Controller. The Gyro on the Steam Controller works fantastic as a virtual yoke and allows for near pinpoint precision control over everything except the Yaw access. The triggers though that control yaw, do have finer control than say the same triggers on an Xbox One controller so even that is an improvement over just a conventional gamepad. This does give me great excitement for playing MSFS on the Steam Deck as you will pretty much have the sim, in a portable system combined with a Steam Controller. Fantastic and I cannot wait for mine for quick couch FSE hops.TLDR. If you like Aviation and Flight, MSFS is a love letter to the skies.";3 May, 2022;

Greak: Memories of Azur;Revenant;752 products in account;46 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Not Recommended 4.6 hrs on record;Let's start with some positives: this game is beautiful! The multiple character mechanic is fine, and the puzzles are ok (Trine did it better, IMO).The difficulty curve makes no sense though. Boss fights are really hard to manage with multiple characters because they don't move at the same speed or dodge together, so it ends up being better to just abandon the other characters and focus on one. Worse, save points are spread out, but there is often not a save point right after a boss. I've had to replay bosses that I beat because I accidentally lost a character after beating a boss because they fell into a spike pit while I was controlling another character.Also there is a lot of backtracking but not really anything interesting while doing so. There is a basic waypoint system but the points are too far apart, and the map is basically useless (it only shows which region you are in).There's a basic cooking system for better health items (combine 3 items to make a better item) but it's trial and error and nothing keeps track of what recipes you've discovered.The dialog system immediately annoyed me because the text moves as it is revealed which makes it really hard to read until the text stops moving. There is also no way to quickly skip out of a dialog/talking to a character. Each character has a slightly different dialog with NPCs but there doesn't seem to be much benefit generally. sometimes a NPC will give items to specific characters so you just end up talking to everyone with each character in turn.It's not a bad game overall, but it's not a game I'm craving playing.;9 December, 2021;
Greak: Memories of Azur;aquatorrent;610 products in account;57 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 20.7 hrs on record;*Note that the follow mechanic has been modified since this review was posted.Playing status: 100% achievement, 3x playthroughsGrindy Achievement(s): No.Optional Achievement(s): Yes (14 achievements).Difficult Achievement(s): No.IntroGreak: Memories of Azur is an atmospheric 2D platformer where you can control up to 3 characters at once. Areas will be filled with enemies and puzzles that utilize this mechanic, whether it's for their number or unique abilities.Pros:- 5 unique boss fights- Cleverly implemented puzzles- Atmospheric sceneryCons:- Great learning curve at the beginningSpecsIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650Should you buy this game?Yes.I greatly recommend this if you like atmospheric 2D platformers. I won't recommend it to people who are not good at multitasking or are new to platformers though due to the great learning curve.In-Depth ReviewVisualsThe game has a lot of atmospheric visuals. You'll be treated with beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds with a lot of layers and details. The soothing, subtle lighting also helps to make the game looks aesthetically pleasing, especially when combined with the detailed landscapes.StoryI found the story to be very basic. There isn't much depth to it and although it offers additional lore in the form of books for you to read, there isn't much that can be learned from these books either, and most of them talk about some characters in the game world that don't seem to have any use in understanding the worldbuilding. The only thing that I liked from the dialogues is how you'll get different dialogues based on the character that you use.The GameGameplayThe game starts with one character to familiarize yourself with the basic mechanic. There are some weirdnesses in the control scheme like how you have to press a button to climb a vine or stairs instead of using the up button and the long animation delay before you can do another action, but you won't sweat much about it later on, since there's something more important that will hinder your gameplay.The core mechanic doesn't make sense at the beginning. First of all, controlling more than one character is painful since one character has a different jumping mechanic - instead of doing a double jump, she'll float, causing her to land in a completely different direction than the other two. This makes it hard to control all characters at once, especially if you have to jump over small platforms or jump between areas with spikes in them. The solution? Going over the section one by one. I had to do this most of the time at first since I wasn't good at it, which feels weird since I had to redo the same section twice.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2578853749Inactive characters will still get hit by enemies, and you'll get a game over if one of them dies. I can't count how many times I died at the beginning simply because I left a character in an area where monsters spawn while moving the other character to traverse the area. Sometimes it's hard to notice when an inactive character is getting hit, especially if you are focused on one character. Moreover, this becomes unavoidable if all of your characters are in an area with a lot of enemies. Inactive characters might attack without you controlling them sometimes, but I found them to be unreliable.You can only use potions to the character that you are in control of. This makes it hard to heal your characters, especially if you are in a boss battle with 2 characters that need healing. You have to pay attention to the boss and avoid their damage at the same time, after all. There's no way out of it except to tough it out and run, hoping that your character won't die by the time that you're far enough from the boss to heal.PuzzleThe game excels in its puzzle mechanics. Each dungeon will require cooperation between all characters, forcing you to switch between them to reach new places. My personal favorite is the final dungeon, simply because it's more focused on puzzles, forcing you to utilize the characters' ability to clear it.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2578854545CombatEnemies scale as you progress the game. Greak can solo most enemies himself without getting any damage at the beginning, although the same can't be done as you get more characters to control. You'll bound to get one or two damage before defeating them and dodging their attacks can be hard since they are hard to predict. This encourages you to bring all characters to battle, allowing you to stunlock enemies until they die. However, you'll have to deal with the annoying control if you do that, especially after you get the last character since he can't move while attacking, despite having higher damage.Bosses are tough but fair. Some of them can prove to be challenging, especially when you have to control more than one character at once, but they are adjusted to cater to that. Bosses have simple and slow-paced attack patterns, save for one boss that I have no idea how to beat without going solo. You still need to take several tries to defeat them even if you have learned their attack pattern though. The most problematic part about defeating these enemies is in controlling the characters at once, but some bosses allow you to go solo if you enter the boss room with one character.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2578853888Length and DifficultyThe game is very short. It only lasts for 8.4h in my first playthrough, which can be made shorter if you try to avoid all enemies in your way. I replayed the game two more times, and the last one, the one that I did for a speedrun achievement, took ~2h without any effort.The difficulty in this game lies in mastering the controls. You'll spend a lot of time wondering why it works that way, especially regarding the inactive party member that still gets hit, but it becomes more bearable once you got it covered. If you still have a hard time beating the enemies, the game has a cooking feature that lets you cook items and potions from foraging items in the wild, and they are very generous with it.ProblemsThe game don't detect my controller if I reopened it several times and it becomes unresponsive if I exited it with Alt+F4.ConclusionGreak: Memories of Azur is one of the good games that I have played in a while. It has such an atmospheric experience that draws you in, whether it's from the beautiful backgrounds or the soothing music. It can take some time to get used to the mechanics, and yes, I still found them to be weird and clunky at times, but it makes me appreciate the game even more after I get the gist of it. It's not a game for people who wants to learn new mechanics though, since the learning curve is quite high - it takes time to get used to it.Despite its combat problems, puzzles are where the game shines best. I wished that they focus more on this than combat, just like how it's done in the final dungeon. I'm not sure whether the game's length is alright at this point though - it ends way too soon after I get content with the controls. Nevertheless, it's still an enjoyable experience, and playing it several times to 100% it doesn't bore me out in the slightest. I even enjoyed it more on my second playthrough since the control doesn't become alien to me anymore.This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for freeVisit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily!;18 August, 2021;

Beautiful atwork and animations. Simple yet effective combat and a nod back to the good old days of the problem solving and character switching of ""Lost Vikings"" from Blizzard. It is not without it's shortcomings though.

Greak: Memories of Azur;Tamr;NOT INFORMED;16 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 9.0 hrs on record;Aesthetically pleasing, but falls flat mechanically:1) Managing the siblings simultaneously is janky and not fun at all. The AI is horrendous. This is the main mechanic/concept of your game, this is the one thing you should have nailed!2) I can grab on to ledges automatically, but I need a button press for vines/ladders? Why isn't is also automatic or at least simply using the up direction?3) Inventory management is a chore, why isn't it shared? Quest items are not registered if the active character doesn't have them in their inventory. I need to drop and pick up mats to craft stuff4) Why aren't arrows picked up automatically like gems? They're not an inventory item and only 1 of the siblings uses them anyway.5) Health orbs fly randomly to full health characters even if someone else who in dire need of them was closer.6) Whose bright idea was it to not pause the game world when you interact with something involving a textbox? Accidentally click on a sign post or book when fighting a mob? Sucks to be you because now you lose control of your character until you skip through all the text prompts.It's design choices like these that really hinder the enjoyment of this title.Oh, and I forgot to mention that combat is tedious and basically just a spamfest.If you were looking for a 3-person puzzle-platformer then maybe give the Trine series a look.;8 September, 2022;
Greak: Memories of Azur;Jimmy;NOT INFORMED;20 people found this review helpful; Recommended 5.7 hrs on record;Pretty good. Not really a metroidvania, it's more like an adventure platformer with some combat: it's very linear, no backtracking, little to no exploration.Controlling all three characters isn't easy, but I didn't find it as frustrating as some other reviews pointed out.Puzzles are the selling point for me, they're imho the best thing about the game. art is very good, music is ok but gets stale fast. Story is low effort.It's also pretty short (5 hours gameplay if you don't rush it), so it's great if you have a bit of money to spend and little time to play, not so great if viceversa.TL.DR: it won't change your life but it makes for 5 good hours of gaming.;30 April, 2022;
Greak: Memories of Azur;Joe;NOT INFORMED;19 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 8.0 hrs on record;I have mixed feelings about Greak. It's not a bad game but here's what bothered me:- Fighting with multiple characters is super awkward. To make sure neither of your characters dies you have to do mid-combat menuing (switch to the right char, open inventory, consume healing item). When I had the option I did all the boss fights with only one character.- The boss fights could have been designed around the multi-character concept more. E.g. one is fighting monsters but occasionally there is a break which leaves times for another to work on some puzzle ... Instead the bosses are pretty standard platformer style fights- Dialogues are boring.- The game feels a bit unfinished / rushed.That said I enjoyed it enough to finish it (7h). The labyrinth level near the end was actually pretty neat. Also two great patches came out while I played through it. I appreciate that the devs attend to the community's feedback. Maybe it's going to be a better game in a while.;2 November, 2021;

And as others have all been saying : Kenshi and Mad Max tooOk, so I've been bingeing this game for ... apparently the last 62.1 hours and I'm UTTERLY HOOKED. I dunno what it is... -- It has a slow pace, so I like that. But it can get pretty fast too! I just shy away from the insanely dangerous monsters out there... -- You can build things. Workstations, Recyclers (""shredders"" in game), water collectors, but also modular structures and defensive walls! And in multiplayer, the blueprints are visible to everyone so I like to go around and drop in whatever materials I have to help someone out. I love imagining them logging in and seeing their thing that much nearer completion!-- The skills system is fairly straightforward and has noticeable effects as soon as you put points into them, so remember to check your skillpoints before, say, you try to loot a crate - you may get some nicer stuff than before you upped your 'scavenger' skill for example-- The atmosphere is _oppressive_ in that 'walk outside into a blast furnace' heat-wave kind of way. It's challenging, for sure! But when you've finally stripped down to your nothings and watch that temperature gauge drop to a cool 32°C you breathe a sigh of relief and really feel like you're resting in the shade.For an early-access alpha I have experienced fewer bugs and genuine 'errors' than most early access games. I mean really. Most of the stuff that needs work is just 'visual polish' because these devs have really worked on the gameplay and mechanics, so it's definitely playable. And for that price? My 60 hours have long paid-off what I put down for it. And there's so much more to learn and explore!Oh, and the community is great!

I used to be a bus driver (Now an instructor) and I must say it does remind me of when I used to do the job, so from that prospective it achieves what it sets out to do.The graphics are what you would expect of a simulation of this type and don't think it will be winning any awards anytime soon, sound is above average and traffic UI is as expected. I think we should bare in mind that things will only improve as the game matures. I would like to see more things on the road, for example as a bus driver my one nightmare was cyclists! How about adding some of those on the roads and perhaps a reward for leaving plenty of room for them?From what I have seen thus far it does exactly what it says, I have seen some complaints on the price but I think you get what you pay for and £24 for 2 years work is not a big ask by any means.

Bus Simulator 18;Sunshine;352 products in account;48 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 16.7 hrs on record;"Although I only have roughly 4 hours played, I think I can provide an ""educated"" opinion.Deep inside I have always wanted to drive a bus, and now I have the opportunity. I played a Bus Simulator several years ago, but that was nothing compared to this.So let's start off with the bad things about the game.AIThe AI in this game is not the best. It's the same problem I had with the other Bus Simulator I played years ago. So whats wrong with it? Unfortunately, alot.We have two different kinds of AI in this game: the drivers and the passengers/people walking in the world. The AI that irritates me the most is the drivers. When driving around on your route, you will encounter alot of traffic standing still. Why are they standing still you ask? Because the AI drivers doesn't know what to do in an junction/intersection (don't know the difference between the two). They may not have this is every country, but there is a thing called right of way. You will know these roads by a sign showing a white square with a yelley square inside it. When on a road with that sign, everyone coming from your right or left needs to stop and give you the right of way. Not in this game. I have seen several times that cars driving on this kind of road stop and wait for crossing traffic. And they wait until there is NO cars left (coming a car 100 metres away? I'll wait).Because of this, I have been stuck in an intersection too many times, just waiting for the 6 cars infront of me to each wait their turn even though they have right of way. A plus with the driver AI is that they seem to always give the bus right of way. They stop and give me room when turning, and they let me cross the intersection without any problems.But what about the passenger AI? You know what, I have changed my mind. The passenger AI is the most annoying one. No Karen, I have not seen the latest episode of God knows what, and YES LAUREN I WAS AT THE OLD SAWMILL LAST NIGHT. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll explain. The passengers talk. But they haven't gotten alot of lines to say. So they will talk ALOT about the old sawmill and a tv-show I can't remember the name of. Don't get me wrong, talking is good. It makes it more realistic that the passengers say hello and goodbye to the driver and that you can hear them talking to eachother. But it can get too much hearing about the same thing over and over and over and over. And over again.The mapThe map isn't big. I haven't played so much that I have opened the other areas, but from the looks of it, it doesn't look big. Atleast not big enough. I can live with this though. What I can't live with on the other hand is how it looks like the buses and the map was made each to their own. It doesn't looks like the map was designed around the buses. Atleast not the first area.Prepare to encounter tons of sharp turns that you have no chance of getting around without either crashing in a lamppost, getting a wheel on the sidewalk (and lose points) or occupying the other lane as well. As I have mentioned, I have not tried the other two (or one, not sure) areas yet. By the looks of it though, one of the other areas have even tighter turns than the starting area. Can't wait.So what's good about the game? Nothing? Well, yes, the game itself. If that makes sense. If not, let me explain. The concept in this game is super fun. It may look boring just driving around picking up passengers, but it's really not. Although you probably need to like these kinds of games. It's not for anyone.GraphicsThe graphics in this game is beautiful. Although it's not on the same level as the Battlefield-series, we (or atleast I) don't expect it to. The graphics are more than good enough for this type of game, and I love that they use Unreal Engine for this. Great lighting, great textures and character models.Attention to detailEven though this is pretty much expected in this type of game, I'll still give it a plus for it. You are able to move your seat up and down (and to the sides), control every light in the bus by itself and control the doors and the ticket machine (the most fun part).CustomizationThe customization in this game was something I was not expecting. In addition to having a Steam Workshop (which is a HUGE plus), the game also comes with skins and decal you can put on your buses. Customize everything from the licence plate to the interior to the color of the bus. You can even add ads that will give you a weekly (or monthly) income. Cool, right? Thought so.Conclusion/TLDREven though the game has it flaws, it's very entertaining. I like it alot, and I can't wait for the developers to come out with updates and new content. If you like simulator games and/or you liked Euro Truck Simulator, I reccommend buying this game. Just not expect it to be as up to date as ETS.Don't agree with me? Leave a comment! Agree with me?

The world is quite small, overall. There aren't many buses to choose from (unless you buy an additional 3 DLC busses)What busses you DO have to chose from aren't very diverse either. Small bus, medium bus, loooongboi, in like 2 or 3 flavors. In terms of other areas there are some minor issues and some things I like. It's not worth getting into that, the simple fact is that the game doesn't have $45 worth of content. After making a few stops you'll have already seen every pedestrian model. I wouldn't be surprised if half the assets are from an asset store. The game is worth it if you find it on sale for 20-25. Read Dead Redemption 2 costs $60This costs $45That's only a $15 price difference. One is a AAA game loaded with content and story etc.This is a very un-polished title that feels like an early-access game. Obviously it's unfair to compare many games to an AAA title from rockstar... but hey, you want to charge near AAA prices i'm going to have near AAA standards.

Bus Simulator 18;Enigmatika;NOT INFORMED;41 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 19.3 hrs on record;"This is surprisingly a really good game. Almost feels like SCS level of quality (makers of American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2), maybe even better in some aspects despite this game being different entirely (trying not to compare apples and oranges here). And if by chance anybody is wondering, Bus Simulator 18 is much more polished and well made compared to Fernbus and Tourist Bus Simulator. Those are still great games and I understand the dev team behind them isn't that big, it's just that they have massive frame rate and crashing issues that turned me away and lead me to playing this game, which I'm glad I did. PROS- Graphics look good (slightly better than ATS, ETS2).- Can create and ""kinda"" customize your character (color of clothes, hair, skin, and gender change).- Can buy new buses in game with money you earn from doing bus routes and customize them with paints and decals.- Can hire drivers to work for you AND you can EVEN SEE THEM DRIVING THE ROUTES YOU ASSIGNED TO THEM while you're driving your bus route. Something Tourist Bus Simulator, ATS, and ETS2 do NOT do.- Game has a fresh feel, simple & clean interface and easy to understand.- People on the bus leave garbage you have to clean when route is over. They also forget their belongings on the bus sometimes and you have to hurry up and give it back to them. Sometimes you have fare dodgers you have to check, or telling someone to turn their music down because it's too loud in their headphones, etc. All these tiny details are very immersive for me personally.- The game can be played single player OR multiplayer but the steam store page doesn't have it listed.- The city and pedestrians seem much more alive than most games of this type. For example, when it's raining you'll see pedestrians running around because they're wet and/or will have umbrellas. Also if you accidentally come across your own hired bus driver(s) while on route, they'll flash their lights at you. Little details like this make the game feel much more alive imo.- Really great looking map with attention to detail. Does not look generic.- AI isn't stupid and seems to recognize that you exist too (looking at you Tourist Bus Simulator)CONS:- The game heavily lags and/or crashes during the tutorial and there is no other way to avoid this other than to just skip the tutorial entirely, after that the game runs fine with absolutely no frame rate issues.- Wish the map was just a tad bit bigger.- Wish bus passengers had more dialogue as it gets old real fast. And there also needs to be more variety of them as they look too same-y, repetitive. (How many of the same Asian woman clones in the same pink shirt and blue jeans am I going to see?). It may not be the focus of the game, but don't be lazy.I'm sure there are probably other things that I may have forgotten to mention but long story short this game is a well made Simcade that has enough depth for semi-serious players but easy enough a 10 year old kid could understand and play it. I hope the devs make an even bigger and better game next time.";22 December, 2019;

Farmer's Dynasty;AdvancedFollower;259 products in account;262 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 114.9 hrs on record;Let’s get this out of the way first. If you want an actual farming *simulator*, with tons of different brands of machines and implements, ultra realistic soil mechanics, dynamic economy etc. this isn’t it. At first glance, it might look very similar to other farming simulators, and the core mechanics (plow, cultivate, fertilize, sow, harvest) are of course there. However, if you approach it as purely a farming simulator, you will get disappointed and bored due to the shallowness of this aspect of the game.Instead, the game attempts to immerse you in the experience of being farmer in a small village, by introducing quests, NPC’s, RPG-like elements and the ability to repair and upgrade your farm buildings. Think of it as Farming Simulator meets Stardew Valley, with a bit of House Flipper thrown in. Compared to those games, it lacks depth in each respective area, but the game sort of becomes more than the sum of its parts. It’s not just about earning more money so you can buy bigger machines, so you can earn more money faster, and so on. You can set other goals for yourself, like getting a wife, acquiring a higher social status, or rebuilding all your farm buildings with the best building materials.The graphics are actually quite nice, and the map is nicely detailed. The game even has a soil deformation system, so the plow and even tires will leave visible marks in the terrain. You do need to use your imagination to fill in some of the gaps however. There are currently only a few different types of quests (plow, cultivate, repair a building or deliver a package). The dialogue is quite cringe-worthy and very shallow. While you can repair your farm buildings or improve them with new building materials and furniture, you can’t actually construct new buildings, or for example expand the storage capacity of your silo. There are also very few machines and implements available. There are basically two “sets” of machines, Old (that you get for free after completing certain quests) and Modern (that you can buy in the store). There’s a total of 3 different tractors in the game, a 1930’s museum piece, a small Lindner tractor and a slightly bigger Lindner tractor. For a game that’s all about building up your farm from scratch, some mid-range equipment like second-hand 1970’s – 90s tractors would have been very fitting.Edit: As of the full release of the game, there are a few more pieces of equipment and tractors, however it's still very limited. There are still no tractors in-between the modern equipment and the ancient starter tractor, and there are still only two harvesters.Some of the farming mechanics don’t quite make sense. The game doesn’t differentiate between hay and straw (you can feed your cows either), and there’s no bale wrapper or silage pit. There’s also no windrower or tedder. Finally, the balancing of the game doesn’t feel quite right. When you’re starting out, the cost of the modern machines seems absurdly high. Fields on the other hand are basically for free, as a single harvest is more than enough to break even. This results in the first in-game year being a real grind, while during year 2 and 3 you will be swimming in money. More cheaper mid-range machinery, combined with more expensive fields would balance out the progression.If you can overlook the flaws and immerse yourself in the game in spite of them, you’ll probably love this game. It’s a fairly unique blend of different ideas that make a lot of sense when you think about it. Farming isn’t just about driving endlessly up and down a field, it’s also about repairing buildings, talking with your neighbors, raising a family etc.;22 May, 2018;

Best of all, if you lose internet connection, the game claims that it ""can't function properly without internet connection"" even though the only thing that changes is that your stats get drained aggressively, making it impossible to use vehicles, tools, or even sprint. It doesn't just prevent you from playing, it actively punishes you for not having internet connection, and even once you regain connection, you need to restart the game for it to quit punishing you.According to the devs, the game going offline is, in their words, 'a sign that the game is a cracked copy', since, as we know, if you lack an internet connection when you're playing a game, you've clearly committed piracy.edit: my concerns about this were moved to the much less viewed ""technical support""[imgur.com] section of the forums lol";25 February, 2023;

Avoid it unless you get gifted it and you don't mind potentially losing your save file to random bugs. Okay so look, I wasn't going to review this game. I like it well enough on a personal level, but I can't recommend it and I'll get into why in a second, so I thought it was a bit rude to leave a negative review for a game that I like. I was just going to leave it alone and let it carry on being a guilty pleasure in peace, unmolested by unbiased honesty. But then it it pushed me to buys its DLCs just one time too many, with all the subtlety of a full-screen popup of Local Neighbours who want to ""meet"" you, and I just.... just. Okay. You have my attention game devs, I hope you're happy. The game is slow, it's tedious, and I don't just mean in the way that most farming sim type games are slow and tedious, I mean you'll spend over an hour ploughing a single field, and god have mercy on you if you need to actually go through the whole cultivation process for a field away from home. Have fun with that. Personally I don't mind that too much, I'm autistic and games like this are soothing and low-sensory for me (I'm not going to talk about the music. Nope. That crap went off before I even left the first menu screen) so I mean if you too are autistic and dealing with crippling stress right now and you too would like something that you can do repetitively for hours and hours then sure, I recommend it (so long as you don't mind the fact that progress is virtually impossible because it can decide at any time to break your file and force you to re-start for no reason other than the fact that it's an abandoned piece of crap). The NPCs are incredibly cringy. Which I can live with, I'm not here for the NPCs, but it matters to a lot of people. The dialogue was described in another review as sounding like a text-to-voice advert and yep, that's exactly what it sounds like. The graphics are clanky and blocky (and not in the cute intentional way), the gameplay itself isn't clear or intuitive, the tutorial is lacking to say the least, the relationship building elements are so bad they might as well not be there... basically you're just spending £24.99 or whatever they're asking in your country for the chance to run your tractor back and forth on poorly rendered soil forever. And that's something I want to do, and I got this game as part of a humble bundle, so I'm not mad. Heck, I'm so not-mad I even bought those aggressively promoted DLCs (when they went on 70% off, I might add. Except the guide book, that can get wrecked, but more on that in a minute). If you, too, manage to get this game for £1 in a bundle then sure, you too might not be mad about it. It's something to do. But can we just go back to that £24.99 part for a moment - they want *how much* for this unfinished janky piece of sh!t? I'm sorry, what? I get that there was still a significant amount of work involved in what they have yadda yadda yadda and normally I'm not here to crank on artists for charging what they think their product is worth, but combine the poor product with the fact that they've clearly abandoned it half way through, with the fact that they're cash-grabbing with covid-level virility in their DLCs and their guide book (SERIOUSLY?!

The npcs all use the same 10 models or so, and there isn't much in conversation to tell them apart. At least not at the point I got to. It looks like the same dozen or so NPCS teleport around the map as you get near a town. The story is dying for a rewrite about some sort of natural disaster or conflict. The buildings are all brand new, or lacking roofs and have giant holes in the brick walls. And the few remaining people live like that. No roof and all. You are a new face in town who knows how to fix things. Yay! And that brings me to the part that I liked about the game. You get to repair and update just about all the structures. I just wish there was a better reason given for doing it. As for the farming? Primarily this is a driving simulator. You drive all over the map to get free farm equipment, some quests require multiple trips home and back on this slow ass tractor. Then when you have the equipment you are driving laps in your fields to plow, cultivate, seed, fertilize, spread manure, and maybe bale hay. For each field. Maybe if the action radius of each spreader was bigger, it would be less tedious. And you have to trek all your equipment to each field and back. The map is HUGE, and empty. Lots of boring driving. That's where my game time came fromThe animals exist, fishing seems to be broken. And the greenhouse is a set it up and leave it thing. The game is not worth the money.

The character Mooch is an open-minded loveable character, Mooch's character provokes so much emotion, during my 3rd speedrun attempt, I broke into tears, seeing such a small creature have a massive impact on the game like that, makes me so happy, it shows that the little man still has a shot at making it big.

Mooch has been there for me when no one else was. When I first purchased this game, I hated the thought of touching the grass, I hated the thought of an outside world.

Construction Simulator 2015;EivlEvo;NOT INFORMED;169 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 37.0 hrs on record;"Ok... so since this game is getting mixed reviews, and MOST of the gameplay vids I could find were all some variation of the same job/mission/equipment, I thought I'd throw a writeup together that could actually offer some fresh insights.What is this game?The gameplay is mostly doing actual construction. By that I mean, you essentially take various vehicles (flatbeds, dump trucks, cement mixers etc) and drive them from the job site, to the necessary materials dealer. There you purchase the materials, load up with a forklift, or some other medium, and transport them back to the job site. At the job site, you will perform a specific task, that can be tedious/dull/etc. OR, it can be exactly what you're hoping it will be. Allow me to elaborate.With the mini excavator for example. You're often assigned a task of digging a small trench. As you may expect... this takes time. It's quite repetitive, but it is in fact digging, which is a component of construction, and frankly... a feature that many of you should be interested in playing this game.I've also used extensively the larger flatbed truck with the crane attached to it. This vehicle I find a little annoying, because the darn health and safety rubes have had their way, and I'm unable to reposition it without completely retracting the boom, and stowing it.What about the many complaints?Well... I think the physics are quite alright. Certainly not perfect, but then again... I don't think the physics in Kerbal Space Program, Euro Truck Simulator, or Microsoft Flight Sim are perfect either. BUT... this game is still VERY playable with the current setup. I would'nt even think to consider the physics to be ""game breaking"".Other people have complained of game crashing bugs or glitches. I haven't encountered a single one. I thought my game had crashed once, but it was actually my laptop going into hibernate because I had exhausted the battery playing this game.Also the controls. I'm not entirely sure what people expect here? I'm also not sure what the issue is? I play this game just fine using the keyboard and mouse... INCLUDING some of the more complex equipment. I'm not certain a controller would make it easier either. Fact. Excavators have MANY controls. They have to bind them somewhere on a PC... and while the learning curve may be present, it certainly isn't steep. Controls are a non-factor here. Simple as that.So then... should you BUY this game?If you're looking for a game where you can drive some abstract trucks that have a LOT of extra gizmo type functionality (crane parts, dumpers, stabilizers, etc)... and you don't mind doing the leg work involved in ACTUAL construction, with some stages of digging, dumping, pouring, craning added in... then yes. This game is solid. 8/10.If you're looking for something with a little more hands on, and less transporting... then no. Leave it be.THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS GAME IS!It's like Euro Truck Simulator, with slightly different physics, and the added task of doing the work at the delivery sites, rather than simply delivering. It adds that extra little bit. A great starting point to build off of. But not perfect.Overall, 7/10. If you're a sim nerd, or a construction fan... bump it to 8/10. If you're looking for ETS... I won't drop any points, but just go play ETS.";26 November, 2014;

No game is perfect, but this one has just the right recipe for me.In addition, a year after release the devs are still very attentive, cranking out updates, bug fixes and DLC. They have also released editing tools and tutorial videos for the modding community.I've seen negative reviews written by people who played only a few hours, were stumped by some problem outside the game (computer or network problems, most often game controller problems) and had no patience to try to make it work for them. I use two full-size joysticks, a steering wheel and pedals, with no problem whatsoever. All these devices are 10 years old and my computer is 6 years old.I've also seen complaints by people with unrealistic expectations. While CS2015 is not a perfect technical simulator (what do you expect, it is based on the Unity engine), it is realistic enough that it WILL help you with real-life operation. For example, I sometimes use excavators in real life, and playing this game with two full-size joysticks helps me maintain and improve my dexterity. Also, it is not focused on simulating a single machine, but rather a broad range of them.But simulation is not the core of this game. Having fun building, driving, operating machines is what it's about, especially in multi-player sessions, which are where the game shines. Some players have complained that there is too much driving, too much delivery. These people obviously have never observed a real-life construction site. It's all about delivering materials when needed and setting them in place with machines. That is what the game does. Running around hammering nails would make a very boring game.;1 December, 2015;
Construction Simulator 2015;mojo_stevo;NOT INFORMED;142 people found this review helpful18 people found this review funny; Recommended 59.4 hrs on record;Good game but here are some thoughts...First off, I'm a big heavy equipment fan. I've been around tractors since I was 3, everybody in my family was in construction at some point or another, it's in my blood. So when I saw there was another heavy equipment sim out, I decided to try it, and approached it with an eager, open mind.My only other experience with construction sims is with Demolition Company. that was a fun game, but it left you wanting more freedom and construction activities. this game offers just that. Bugs:I don't think this game is as bug ridden as people say it is, you've just really got to pay attention to the details. For example: One user wrote he was upset because he was unable to exceed 10KPM in the tipper. I ran into this same issue, then I realized I didn't secure my load and retract the booms all the way. Once I did, I accelerated to much higher speeds. Physics:If you've ever operated a real machine, or simply a hand shovel, the digging physics in this game are going to annoy you at first. The excavator physics (once I finally set the joystick functions to CAT/standard US) I was soon annoyed by how unrealistic the digging is. Then I realized how the game thinks you should dig (you'll learn, lol) and it was smooth sailing from there. Digging seems to be the hardest physic to animate and develop for a game, hence the reason this is as far as it's come so far.I just barely finished the tutorial but, so far, I like the game despite it's quirks. Still, I'm glad on only spend the 60% off sale price on it.Be patient, I have a feeling things will only get better with these construction simulators. More machines and better physics are inevitable. Just look how far other simulation games have come. Flight Simulator 2000 anybody?;26 May, 2015;

The crane elements work particularly well, the flatbed with the extending boom crane is a particular favourite. Excavation could be better, but once you get used to its quirks you can get along with it easily. I wouldn't put much stock in Youtubers playing this, none of them seem to have gotten very far. The large Liebherr excavator is much more satisfying than the small one you start out with, I think you'll find the small ones are pretty pathetic in reality too! There can be a lot of driving in this, and for me this REALLY needs TrackIR or Oculus Rift. Games with cockpits are transformed completely by adding these things, it really brings them to life.On top of that, simple things like controls for gears, brakes etc aren't there which further detracts from any realism. If you don't like a particular element of the game, later you can just get your employees to do it. You don't earn XP, but you do earn money so you can go off and do whatever you like. Once you get a second foreman, the money just roles in and you can start building your fleet. The way emplyees and foreman work needs some changes, you can't get them to do a whole job, neither can they manage themselves (despite being your senior). I hope the modding gets going with this, I would particularly like the ability to change attachments on excavators, similar to farm simulator. The stock shovel you get with the Liebherr excavator is pretty small.... and I'd also like a telescopic handler!;21 June, 2017;

I've played tons of early access and alpha / beta games, so bugs and glitches don't mean a whole lot to me. Often they can add a bit of unintended fun to the game and maybe even a few laughs like the flying, hovering, bouncing and wall climbing AI cars in this game - something that seems to have been fixed with the latest updates (sad face: no more fun flying cars).If anything, I would say that the guys behind this game have gone that extra mile to come up with a very decent way of presenting menus and interaction with the game components. Community suggestions for improving the game UI have been added into the game time and again, just like community feedback on glitches and bugs have been fixed.Lately a number of major fixes and feature upgrades have been released, which has just made the game that much better.I've got 70+ hours on this game, even with glitches and hick-ups and I have never really run into anything truely game breaking anywhere in the game. The concept is strong and solid, the missions are nicely varied and there is a nice enough selection of vehicles and work horses in the game to make it that much more fun playing a ""simple"" simulator. You get to actually dig and move dirt using excavators and trucks, pour cement on building parts and step-by-step build anything from small houses to huge appartment complexes. I wont spoil the game, except to hint that there are special missions worth your time and focus.When I saw the release of the first DLC for this game, which contains an additional tower crane I didnt even blink before I had completed the Steam transaction for the purchase (the only other game I have ever done this with is EuroTruck Simulator 2). Don't mind the haters on the community hub demanding 6,000 other vehicles: they just want the game to play for them .)If you like simulators and heavy equipment, then do not hold yourself back on this title. With or without a discount, it's worth the money regardless. On the plus side, you get a decent amount of unintended fun moments at no extra charge!My personal oppinion is that the ""Mixed"" review status no longer applies.

However, so far into the game it seems that it should be called ""construction material transport simulator"" rather than construction... It seems that the good stuff does not start to happen in the game anytime soon.All I have been doing go buy this go buy that and bring it to the construction site with the occasional dig here dig there. The game is pretty slow. Graphics are not very appealing, everything seems flat. there isn't even animation in buildings rising from the ground and becoming something beautiful. Bring in material, done, texture pop-in a house made of bricks all of a sudden. Would I recommend this game? No, unfortunately. This simulator could have been A LOT better than that. Nevertheless, I am not slamming the door on this game should it become a franchise and see later iterations i.e 2016 2017 etc. Unless Construction simulator becomes a better game later down the road, this will be the first and last I'll ever buy.If I want to compare, there is for example, Euro truck simulator 2, it is simply driving a truck from point A to point B delivering orders and that is it. This sounds miles more boring that construction simulator, I have done about 48 hours driving trucks around europe. Why is that you might ask, because it is VERY good at what it does, the gameplay feels right the truck weight, the handling with or without a light or heavy trailer loads, the graphics are alright and there are also very good quality attributes in that game.

Remember, goldsellers and bots exist for one purpose. To sell game currency, and to cheat their way to get it. They have unlimited time, effort and incentive to dedicate to circumventing your restrictions. Real players don't. They are frustrated. Many have or will simply quit.2) Set out a release schedule for the game for 3 months staggered early access, and then listened to the community, going back on your plan and instead releasing a one month early access. The servers were not ready. Commander Load Fail crashed things left, right and center all through early access. Now, nearly two months post-launch, the lag is STILL intolerable with no end in sight. Stability isn't even a pipedream at this point, especially for the SEA and SA servers who can barely play the game, because in 2016, it seems that you have contracted with a company who can't even provide basic DDoS protection for your servers.3) Announced free to play and then pushed it back two weeks because the game wasn't ready. You held multiple 24-hour maintenances to manually accomplish server transfers, a task that other game companies can automate in 10 minutes. When the game still wasn't ready you launched free to play anyway with even more devastating restrictions on free players. The free players came, and the servers crashed, spluttered and crawled again, even harder this time.4) You launched free to play with all of the restrictions on free players, without any method to let those free players purchase TP to alleviate their restrictions. Now that you have finally released your absurdly overpriced one time DLC packs that BARELY include any TP, about a third of your potential customers have already quit.5) During this entire time, you have refused to communicate with your player base on ANY level, including issuing cut and paste, irrelevant responses to support tickets, ignoring almost every keystone community issue as if they didn't exist, and issuing patch notes weekly for bug fixes that could have been accomplished by one intern working part time. Are you working on something big? Is there a reason that none of the kToS patches are being pushed here? Do you even PLAN to have the kToS patches applied here? Are you doing ANYTHING? We certainly don't know.6) You take weekends off in a 24/7 customer service industry, leaving your product non-functional to entire subsets of your (paying) playerbase for DAYS at a time. In any other industry, your company would be bankrupt, shut down, your CEO and anyone in even the most remote position of authority would have their jobs nixed.7) You FIRED your community manager for doing what she was supposed to do. And you replaced her with a soundless, emotionless void.8) When paired with all of your other problems, including but not limited to:bizarre, constant lag, disconnects, abilities misfiring, chat randomly being eaten by the ether (and while we're on the subject, the Orwellian chat filter that would be out of place in a children's game, much less one with blatant sexualization, panty shots and etc.) characters getting stuck, players being unable to get into dungeons, or being kicked out of dungeons once they are, the constant goldseller spam, bots camping high level grinding areas pushing legitimate parties out, world boss monopolization, lack of rewards for pvp, the glitchy market limit system, lack of meaningful rewards for pve (weeks with nothing but talt), class balance issues, item balance issues (arde dagger and cafrisun best in slot for 200 levels for -every- class without fail), the unsustainable economy (~10 high end items with absurdly luck based cost-enterprising, and the diminishing demand/cost for materials, creating a compelling reason for players to buy from goldsellers who are ever-present), poor translation, artificial grind walls and newbie traps, and glaring lack of social features (even a guild requires a rank 7 character to create), and many others I am probably forgetting:It is clear how you feel about this game. Which is to say that you don't. You have no industry awareness whatsoever, and this is coming from someone who has played numerous F2P games in the past, from the likes of Nexon, Webzen, Aeria and etc., all companies who are notorious for their poor customer service. You somehow manage to project even less of a positive image than they do. Incredibly, this is the first time I have ever actually felt like I enjoyed playing a game more than the developers enjoy making and maintaining it.So why with all of these issues have I continued to play, and why am I done now? Because no matter how many issues I think the game has, I can deal with them if I believe the developer cares and is working on fixing things. I played FFXIV (the original) which was one of the most poorly received MMOs EVER, because I still liked the core game, and because Square-Enix acknowledged their mistakes and decided to try and fix them.With the release of these DLC packs for $30 and $35, it is apparent that you believe you deserve the cost of a AAA game for putting forth zero effort. You do not market. You do not improve server stability. You do not communicate with your players. You do not address major game issues. You can't figure out how to implement the purchase of your own cash shop currency. You can't hardly claim overhead worthy of those prices, because you have nothing to show for the fruits of your labor over the last two months.

Let me start by saying I love playing this game. I like that vibe you get when you can just AFK and chill out with guild mates and friends. But IMC does not care about you.First issue:Because someone else exploited hacked items, the people who ended up with these items were punished without compensation. They confiscated any items crafted with materials made from exploits and hacked items. If your item was made up of 90% legal items and 10% hacked items, you lost the entire item. If you reach out for support, they send you a generic response and tell you they cant help you. However, they told me that for some of my items, I can get them back if I pay them silver. I felt as if I am getting punished for unknowingly crafting with hacked items. For example, Vaivora equipment is extremely rare and expensive to obtain. I had a legitimate Vaivora staff which I made into an Ichor (special term meaning I made it into something that could be put into another staff to share the stats) and placed it in my staff which apparently had been crafted with hacked items. They confiscated the entire item. When I submitted a ticket to ask them what other items they took from me, they refuse to tell me what items because of a security risk. This is my account and I am logging a ticket from my account, but they can just go in and remove items and not even bother to tell me what items were confiscated. This staff alone is fairly expensive in game already from crafting it, enhancing it, transcending it, and having a Vaivora equipment in it.The progression isnt something you can just grind in a week. There are countless other people who lost other items that probably took a good few months to obtain. IMC sends out the same ticket responses that they are not returning any confiscated items. No compensation, nothing. So if you spent 500m to make your equipment, if 20m of it was hacked materials, you are out 500m when they confiscate it. There are botters here and there and not a single GM in sight. IMC caters to whales, it feels like they dont even care about the rest of their community.Second Issue:The game is pretty heavily invested towards whales, though there are a good amount of players who make it without spending money. The game makes some questionable changes as in removing field farming for silver so you have to spend time in game looking for a party who would want you (if you are undergeared, most people are biased) to make any money from Challenge Mode/Singularity. There are multiple ceilings for a new player, but there are still people in the game that would help you.[Update] https://imgur.com/tSgESdbThey are now trying to extort me, a victim.

You're encouraged to buy at least 500 TP's worth of these in order to get the advertised single extra ""bonus"" lootbox which has no enhanced chances so it will likely be some common item. The common items are usually something like ""Attribute Points""...something used to slightly enhance skill damage or learn skill modifiers, which your characters will accumulate a lot of through normal weekly content. Attribute points as a reward are not worth the money spent.Goddess' Blessed Cubes are their cosmetic lootboxes. It's 300TP for 30 boxes + one bonus box if I recall correctly. The cosmetics you get range from weapon skins, to cosmetic accessories, to full costumes and wings. The costumes and wings are usually the main attraction, but they have such a low rate that 31 boxes may not even get you a costume set or wings. The weapon skins need a premium material to be applied...you'll either have to fork out more TP to apply them or trade in several of the premium cosmetics you just opened to get ""premium medals"" to buy it that way. Everything from these cubes is usually tradeable on the market, so the easiest way to get massive amounts of in-game currency is whaling and selling the ""rewards"". For the ""support packages"", the ""grind skip slips"" are things like ""Transcendence 10 scrolls"", which allow you to fully transcend a piece of equipment. Transcendence, at stage 10, doubles the raw stats of an item. To transcend without these scrolls, you need to get Goddess Blessed Gems, which are dropped sparingly through challenge content. A Trans 10 scrolls basically lets you skip weeks worth of gem grinding. Other P2W items include special enhancement ""Ruby"" or ""Diamond"" anvils which allow you to more safely enhance equipment. Equipment enhancement provided small stat bonuses, with larger bonuses for milestones like +11, +16, and +21. Past +5, every attempt at enhancing a piece of equipment has 50% chance of failing. Past +11, there's a chance that it will drop back down to +11 instead of going down by one, unless you use a Ruby Anvil which changes the catastrophic safe point to +15. Diamond Anvils will not drop enhancement level upon failure, but will make an item lose potential. Item Potential affects its tradeability and gives it a chance to break. Every failure with an anvil reduces potential, with a failure at 0 potential destroying the item. Golden and Ruby anvils will not break a 0-pot item, allowing whales to brute force RNG higher enhancement levels. A F2P player will struggle to make a +16 Trans 10 weapon without waiting for months worth of events, while whales will frequently make +21 or higher equipment. Final Notes:If you're still interested in playing, I would suggest waiting until IMC launches another ""Season Server"". They're geared at providing huge bonuses for new players to help them ""catch up"" to existing players, and seasonal merges into the main servers after a few months. The last one ended in November 2020...they will probably have a new one early 2021. Be warned, however...IMC does scummy things with these as well:They offered a ""Roullette"" to get potentially amazing bonus items for seasonal players during the last server, using coins earned through in-game play. There was a limit of 1000 coins you could get for the duration, with a daily limit of 25 coins you could earn. Each spin cost 10 coins, and you were limited to 100 spins. As you approached 70-80-90 spins, the reward pool would start removing the ""trash"" tiers filled with stuff like attribute points. Fun, and a nice bonus...or so you'd think. A little over halfway through the seasonal server, they released the roullette early with the excuse that most people had hit their coin cap already. They said they'd do a second roullette at the original planned end of the server, and increase the coin cap to 2000, but did not say how the rewards would change. People were confused on whether to spend their coins now, or wait for the second. Their second roullette had much better rewards, and a higher cap...but anyone who spent coins on the first roullette basically got screwed over, because the new coin limit wasn't raised until after the first roullette ended, and due to the 25 daily coin limit, people wouldn't be able to accumulate more than 600 or so by the time the server ended. IMC then decided to sell P2W packages with bonus roullette coins...200-300TP packages for 50 roullette coins each, or a 900TP package that got you 200. The seasonal roullette wasn't really a gift to new players...it was a vector to sell more TP and slot machines to whales. There was no transparency about this stuff, and it's left a bitter taste in my mouth.";13 December, 2020;

Portal Knights;??Levi's??;NOT INFORMED;120 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 643.9 hrs on record;After several hours of playing Portal Knights from time to time, i think i can give a decent review for you.The first thing i wanna say is: PK is a really good game and has the potential to be one of the best sandbox RPG's out there, but lacks some RPG content and other things i am going to tell you.Pros:- The graphic of PK is imo very beautiful and fresh.- animations (characters and enemies) are fluid and nearly every enemy has it's own mechanics and fighting style. The game get's easier while you learn the diffrent patterns- The character customization is O.K. (race (with Elves DLC), gender, hair, eyes, voice, colors, ears, accessiors...).- 3 unique classes (+1 with Rogue DLC) all with unique skills and abilities- The weapon- and armor skins are decent looking and have a cool design.- ability to customize your characters without losing armor stats - you wanna be a warrior in a rabbit costume? go for it! you wanna wear that cool magearmor on your warrior? feel free to do it!- various weapon types for the different classes- various different biomes, with totally different appearance- selectable island size- harvesting - NPC's and merchants you can relocate- simple but well implemented quests and questlines- vacant islands with no monsters for building.- possibility to reset your world for new content without loosing your progress on vacant-/home islands.- creative mode with unlimited blocks and designable islands.- unlimited building possibilies, with lots of unique blocks.- many, very cool and unique decoration items to customize your home.- the crafting system is O.K. could be better though.- developers listen to community, good bug support, new updates every few months. - 4 man coop mode- Hardmode bosses and lategame instances (Rift's with DLC) may be challanging even for good players- anti griefing mechanic allows you to decide if people can build/loot chests on your home islands- DLC's (some are free, some are a bit overpriced, Rogue&Rift DLC totally worth it, if you enjoy the game)- seasonal eventsFor the cons i firstly wanna say, that the RPG content in PK could be way better.The balance of classes, weapons, skill points, spells is really bad. Why go for a melee weapon, if you can deal nearly the same damage with a ranged weapon?There is a great weapon variation, but in the end there are only 1-2 types per class to go for. The talents you can trait after leveling your character should get a rework, because some of them are just useless.Cons:- every enemy in PK will hit you like a rock, means you will die within 2-3 hits if not investing skillpoints in health. This might be a challange for some players, but can be frustrating.- ranged combat feels much more rewarding than melee combat- as melee: prepare to die - alot- classes are a bit unbalanced in difficulty (warrior is very easy for beginners, as mage you will run mostly and try to not get hit by anything. Also spells are a bit weak, consume a lot of mana)- combat quickly gets boring and annoying because no attack variations- no coin storage possible (this sucks because everytime you die you loose 100 coins)- dodgeroll 80% of time - water is in the game but no swimming or diving, just lower gravity. Some enemys don't drown in water, but you do.- most of the random events feel clunky - 90% go there, kill this trashmob X-times- level grind from lv. 25-30 because PK is lacking late game content. Means you have to kill bosses or monsters over and over again or reset your world and repeat quests- after lv. 30 there is not much to go for RPG wise - you maybe wanna get steam achievments or optimize your characters armor- hard mode bosses are really difficult solo, but pretty doable in coop-mode- many items dropped by monsters are simply useless and after some time you will constantly delete stuff filling your inventory- many items to harvest are mostly useless because you can buy all the important stuff from vendors (potions, ...)- no instanced loot in coop - who picks it up first, keeps itConclusion:BUY if you are into building/collecting/adventuring. Buy on sale if you are interested in this game.EDIT: Since you guys like this review i am gonna edit it depending on future content updates!Anyway, feel free to ask questions about the game in comments.;28 May, 2018;

I put over 100 hours into this game and I enjoyed it for what it was (thanks to the massive amount of patience I have), but the biggest problem with this game is that there isn't anything to do really, which is hindering this game from being a solid competitor to giants like Minecraft or Terraria. You jump from world to world trying to find the next portal and you quickly begin to realize that they all look the same and none of them have much to offer other than to mine, fight nearly the same enemies over and over, explore petty dungeons, and find the next portal. The game isn't as deep as a game like Terraria for example and honestly I wonder if this game is meant for kids or something. Let me make a simple pros/cons list.Pros:-;13 July, 2017;

That is not the issue. Sadly, it has fundamental flaws, which have been present for YEARS and have not been fixed yet. But let me explain.First of all, the game itself. It is really nice, with quests, exploring and building. There are events form time to time to add a little extra even. The game itself is lovely and well worth playing. Multiplayer works fine.On with the problem: The game has some kind of issue saving (steam cloud according to several forums online). I first encountered this when the game went black after leaving to main menue. I had to close it via task manager and lost A LOT of progress. Second time I didn't lose much but that made me realise that it was a more common ""something is fecky"", not a one time thing.Now, after over 35 hours in the game, the game wouldn't load, I had to close it via task manager again, and ALL MY SAVE FILES were corrupted and would not load. Nothing would work. There are several posts on Reddit, steam etc on how to fix it (again, apparently some kind of issue with steam cloud) that are over 2 years old! How can this not have been fixed yet? Especially when it is a really common problem?? That is just lazy imo as it could have been fixed by even just removing the option of steam cloud.They can publish DLCs one after anther but not fix this??

Portal Knights;ActaNonVerba;NOT INFORMED;88 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 10.8 hrs on record;If you like Terraria and/or Minecraft, you will most likely love this game. I don't have a lot of time invested, but so far I really like it. HOW THE GAME WORKS:1. You can choose from 3 different classes. Essentially a knight, archer and mage. You gain abilities, weapons and armor sets as you lvl up and progress through each world level.2. There are 44 worlds to progress through. each have their own theme, enemies and resources. (There are also boss worlds.)3. The idea is to explore an area, mine its resources then find and repair the portal to the next realm (Sometimes more than one portal.)4.You can build homes, various workstations, tools, weapons, armor, spells and potions.The only bad thing I can say, (And this is my opinion.) is that each realm is very small. It takes 15-20min to explore each one. That being said, there are 44 realms and you have to go back to previous realms for specific resources at times, so you get decent use out of most realms. And to be honest it is kind of exciting trying to hurry and get to the next area, because you have no idea what it is!Also take into account this game is in testing. I personally think this game has a lot of potential.PROS:Nice visuals.Good progression system.Engaging gameplay.Really fun co-op play.CONS:Some bugs and crashes. (To be expected.)Small areas.I like this game a lot and think its worth $15. Try it out!;18 April, 2016;
Construction Simulator;game;NOT INFORMED;104 people found this review helpful24 people found this review funny; Recommended 12.9 hrs on record;This is my 2 hour review:It's a good game so far. You start as a young guy that proved himself to his mentor and earned the right to take over his company as he retires. It's well balanced, just goofy enough that you don't take it too seriously, but just serious enough that you feel like you're actually doing something. But this isn't a 'Construction' Simulator, it's a 'Heavy Equipment Operator' Simulator. You hardly spend any time out of your vehicle and never once have I swung a hammer, dealt with a crooked safety officer, or been paid late because the boss bought his kids some 4 wheelers....I will be keeping this game, no returns needed.

Construction Simulator;NeonSephiroth;NOT INFORMED;173 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 48.7 hrs on record;A couple of quick fixes for things some people are refunding the game or writing bad reviews for:Controller not working:On the steam page where you start the game, click on the cog wheel, then Properties. Under Controller, select “Disable Steam Input” in the drop down menu.Free Camera:Clicking the left stick will enable the free camera… for a very short period of time before locking you back in. To keep it “free” indefinitely, go to the ingame settings -> Camera -> Camera Controls (Controller) and switch it to “Toggle”. Once you toggle it, it will stay free (which is an absolute must for driving) until you either click the stick again, change views, or exit the vehicle. If you want to use your mouse for a free view without having to hold the mouse button, enable either “toggle” or “always” under Camera Controls (Mouse).— Update —Steam Deck Support:I’ve seen this asked a lot in comments all over, so I figured I’d add it in here for those who are wondering. As of today, Sept. 24th 2022, Valve has not officially verified Steam Deck support for this title. After a few minutes of testing it myself, I can confirm that it does in fact work on the Deck right “out of the box”. On the default settings, I am getting somewhere between 35 to 40 fps, but I’m sure frame rates can be further improved with some tweaking in the settings. One minor issue I noticed was that the start and select buttons (sorry I'm old school. you know the one with the three lines and the one with the two windows) BOTH bring up the menu (settings, end game etc.) unlike on the Xbox controller, where one brings up the menu and the other the map with company/contracts/etc. Without the map/company functions, this game would be unplayable, as you can’t currently change button mappings in the game (unless if you maybe change the Deck’s controller layout in Steam itself). Luckily the map is accessible by pressing either one of the touchpads. Obviously this could change once support is official/verified, but until then just make sure you don’t somehow have those deactivated.——Many of the performance complaints may sort themselves out for you as well. My rig is fairly beefy (8700K, 3080, 32GB RAM, SSDs etc., everything overclocked) and also had initial stuttering issues. Many games have this “problem” when first loading maps as you drive through them. This happens on your first run or any time there’s a game update. Once the game loads in the new assets, aka you’ve visited most parts of the map, the stutter should subside and performance should improve significantly. There are still some optimization issues regardless, but those will hopefully be patched out soon.Overall I’m not saying the game has no problems at all. Personally I think the controls take some getting used to, traffic lights stay red for way too long, and traffic moves way too slowly, among other little things that could be improved. A few minutes spent in the settings, however, might improve your experience to an acceptable and even enjoyable level until patches are out, it definitely did for me. To be fair, the developers’ choice of default settings aren’t ideal, but maybe try these first and play around with other settings before giving up on the game entirely. Cheers;20 September, 2022;

Construction Simulator;A;NOT INFORMED;451 people found this review helpful26 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 8.4 hrs on record;I work in construction in real life, have done all my life, so I was very excited to see this game released. I've been playing the game for a bit and have read some other reviews, so, here's where I'm at.. The 'game' part of this is good. There graphics are nice and machines are well detailed. The environment is cool with plenty of scenery as well as AI. There is a slight emptiness to the world though and I'm not sure what it is. Unfortunately though, this is where the good stuff ends for me. Now I understand this game is brand new and therefore will change however there's a little too much for me that needs to change. - The menu is really, really confusing. It's just not intuitive, it feels like it's been muddled up each time I open it.- The camera is constantly fixed to a position when driving making it extremely hard to see. I eventually found a button on my controller which unlocks it but then some features of the machine don't work... and so on.- I'm very experienced when it comes to operating excavators but I actually find it harder to accurately dig a hole in this game than I do in real life. The controls are really hard to use and are not smooth enough.- The small compact machine feels the same as the machine that weighs nearly 4x more. Hydraulics aren't properly simulated.- Jobs aren't great in my opinion. I had to level a small pile of dirt in a space no larger than your average home+garden. For this job, instead of using a small machine, the game made me hire a huge cat dozer. The job was on a residential street! You don't see dozers this big on most construction sites, let alone in a small neighbourhood- Same happened on this job when I needed to dig a tiny trench for 3 PVC pipes, it had me hire a 20+ tonne cat excavator. - There's no bucket variation or attachments for machines. You do everything with the same full size tooth bucket, extremely unrealistic- The digging simulation itself is a big step up from the previous construction simulator however is not good enough in my opinion. There's no real feeling to the machine when digging, it just drags along and the bucket sometimes fills up.- The game doesn't seem to care about how deep or straight the trench is (one of the most important things when digging) but instead just how much soil comes out the ground. The trench was all over the place and wasn't even finished, but because I had dug out X amount of soil, it said it was complete!- When it came to lifting some small PVC pipes (very lightweight plastic) the game made me use this big crane on the back of my flatbed, instead of just lifting them by hand like you do in real life. - I just felt like I was going around in circles. This job in real life would need a small 8 tonne excavator with a trenching bucket, and a grading bucket (to level off the material). Instead I've had to use a massive bulldozer, excavator, backhoe, and a crane. I want to give this game a thumbs up a lot, but in it's current state for the price, I really can't.My worry is that it's destined to be more like a game, in which case I don't think it will be popular for very long. It needs to be a proper simulator. This is what will keep people playing because the campaign or story wont matter if the simulation is good. Look at games like farming simulator or euro truck simulator, there is no story at all but because the game is so realistic, people play it for years. Devs if you read this I'd love to speak to you guys more on stuff that could maybe change.;25 September, 2022;

New Star GP;Sida79;16 products in account;29 people found this review helpful; Recommended 53.5 hrs on record;"It seems pretty cool. Kind of that simple/colorful old school Lotus games feel with a pumping track while you race through colorful environments, but more complex, of course.Driving feels fun enough, the game looks like it's a visual successor to Microprose Grand Prix while adopting the usual stuff from the newer F1 games. The visual style is really cute.Turbo mode makes you go about 1400 km/h for a while, which is hilarious, but fun.Famous driver make-believe names and likeness are goofy in a good way.Most of the music tracks are banging, one sort of sounds like 90's midi.Some things I didn't like:-graphics need a bit of AA to shine fully, perhaps an engine limitation?-the interface is colorful but often messy with so many colors and elements vying for your attention-no online multiplayer? like, among friends at least, if not public servers?-the colors of the racing line are not precise at all a lot of the time (brake, when you can go full speed)-the music, while great, sounds like the 80's are covered and one 90's track and that's it for nowbug: I'm using keyboard controls and they keep resetting to the default every now and thenbug: the same happens with audio levels, I lower the FX down and often it'll just go silent until I tweak the settings a bitbug: game repeatedly freezes when trying to occasionally alt+tab out of it and back (full screen windowed, not exclusive I think)suggested improvement: the billboards above the track interfere with the view and even flash when using the ""far back and away"" viewsuggested feature: car and driver editor, just names and colors (and speed?), nothing fancyperhaps a more detailed way to paint the car, like the microprose GP, or betterI reckon people could use this to simply create any sort of driver/team matchup that ever existed in the real worldAnyone want to argue that wouldn't be awesome? :)I'll come back to retract half of what I've said and write new stuff later :)";8 August, 2023;

New Star GP;C9PLMS;NOT INFORMED;24 people found this review helpful; Recommended 10.7 hrs on record;It baffles me how easily this game manages to beat every other modern racing game at creating an authentic and enjoyable career mode.NSGP interweaves team maintenance with driving and pit strategy in a way that hasn't been done before (as far as I can tell), without sacrificing accessibility or fun. Other games have similar team features, but no pit strategies, while other games have pit strategies, but with either not as robust of team maintenance OR completely lacking it in general. NSGP forces you to pick your strengths and eat your weaknesses, so which team members you choose and how you treat them will constantly affect your race strategy. Pit chief isn't happy? Your pit times will be longer. Head of PR isn't happy? You won't make as much money. Chief engineer isn't happy? Your car might break down. Took your pit chief out to lunch? You'll get a cash bonus for doing a 2-stop soft strategy instead of a 1-stop medium.Then there's the rivalries and public relations, which I'd argue is the best and most unique part of this game. You can make everyone else absolutely hate your guts by doing any of the following:Driving aggressivelyDisobeying track etiquetteRefusing to donate your earnings to charitiesRudely responding to comments about your track etiquetteInsulting other driversYou can also do the opposite of those things for better overall relations if you're a coward. This is a proper, full bodied lifestyle career mode, and it works perfectly, and it's beautiful.The racing itself is nothing to sneeze at either. Although the physics are extremely dampened, everything that would affect how a real F1 car drives also applies here - tire temp, tire wear, track camber, weather, fuel load, and so forth. The driving also isn't THAT arcadey, crashes are brutal and the astroturf will spin you out, and the AI can be quite quick, so you need to respect the racing more than what you might initially think. It's quite engaging honestly.Also, good lord, so many tracks, all faithfully reimagined versions of your IRL favorites, and they feel EXTREMELY different from one another, not just in terms of average speed, but even surface texture and like I mentioned earlier, surface camber.Also, it's verified for the Steam Deck and feels right at home on it.And last, but not least importantly, the best part about this game compared to other modern racers: it actually works.So please buy this and support the devs. They're giving this genre the kick in the ass that it so desperately needs.;27 November, 2023;

Underlying the arcade-y racing is a physics and handling model that you can sink your teeth into. If you enjoy finding the optimal racing line, picking your breaking point, experimenting with how to ride the curbs - that's all there for you, and it feels amazing. That said, NS GP doesn't demand any of this! You can absolutely just focus on approximately following the racing line and avoiding collisions, and still have a blast.So far, career mode seems equally fun and accessible! It takes many conventional race management game systems (part upgrades, staff, dilemmas etc) and gives it a distinct New Star Games flare. Each race weekend has a number of fun and re-playable events that allow you to get acquainted with the track before jumping into the Grand Prix event, which can only be played once. I love this structure, and appreciate how the extra events don't just feel like busywork (like how practice sessions do in other games).Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with NS GP, and can't wait to continue following its development!;8 August, 2023;

Arma 3;this;NOT INFORMED;3,441 people found this review helpful82 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,407.9 hrs on record;Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.;30 September, 2014;

Arma 3;JKCallonetta;409 products in account;806 people found this review helpful26 people found this review funny; Recommended 336.1 hrs on record;Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It’s grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I’ve ever experienced in a videogame. It’s one of those games which, when it finally ‘clicks’ with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It’s not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. I’ll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I’ll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates — it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I’ll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia — you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you’ll laugh through it. ARMA is unlike any other game — any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too.;2 March, 2022;

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.That is what this game is about.;17 May, 2014;

FinesseThe game is made with love and this is noticeable in the details from the first minutes of getting to know the game. Gorgeous icons, rich artwork, delightful music, and high-quality voice acting create a seamless experience. It’s hard to ignore all of this, but I will try to mention the most ambiguous aspects (which combine both pros and cons), leastways according to my opinion and preferences. In terms of mechanics, you control a hero who leads a detachment of specific troops. Your task, considering the enemy’s analysis, is to assemble an appropriate set of troops and position them correctly on the battlefield. Ideally, you should inspect the detachment you plan to attack or that is about to attack you beforehand. During battles, you lack direct control, because units just automatically target nearby opponents. Occasionally, you can use your characters’ ultimate abilities (you can pausing the game to strategically plan such attacks, however, at the same time, there is no opportunity to speed up the battle and this does not always feel pleasant, although it brings a realistic sense of the simplicity of chaos)I still haven’t got a personal impression of whether the game is easy (chill) or hard (strict). On one hand, you can relax and let the units handle the work. On the other hand, if you avoid saving, the game won’t forgive planning errors before battles. Additionally, characters take a really long time to recover after battles, and only under specific conditions.In my opinion, the game beautifully uses card elements. But also, conceptually, this is the same as the usual icons, for example. In order to add a military force to the hero, you click on the card of a certain type of force/unit (having a corresponding set of resources for this and mainly just being in the place where the corresponding cards available) and ""Voilà"" you have troops (as if it had happened in another usual way). In battle you have only a few cards and their have cooldown time, a kind of ""charging/cooling down"" of an ult, which you must use in a timely manner to gain some advantage. I've played quite a wide range of card board games and, in my opinion, this is a far cry from that experience. However, I still like the aesthetics of this idia more than standard icons or macros.Most importantly, still, that the game has just launched in early access, and the potential in it seems promising (the developers plan to add a lot, both to the game itself and to its localization, for example, one of them will be Ukrainian, which, as I know, is very important for many of my friends at now).

Scrap Mechanic;let's;NOT INFORMED;140 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Recommended 48.1 hrs on record;"I don't write many game reviews, but I felt it was necessary to write one for Scrap Mechanic. So here's the basic rundown of the game in my mind and in this review I will be listing items that I think should be addressed. My Experience So Far So far on this game at the time of writing this review I have almost 16.5 hours played. As far as Early Access games go, this one is by far the most advanced from Launch Date that i've everseen on Steam, from Launch it had more than enough to keep you busy for hours on end right out of the gates, not very many games can say that. I started off watching the Videos on the game's page like the Introducing ones that showcased the Controller, Thruster etc etc, then as I experimented and numerous trial and error situations, I started getting better and better at knowingwhat was going on and how things click. I started with a little piddly concrete car with a horendous design, but then I started to get more intricate with my designs, using pipes and I-Beamsto make an overall badass design, then I found out the steering mechanics and how to work the controller with ease, once all this clicked I made some of my best creations. Multiplayer As fun as this game is when you're alone, I thought to myself, ""Wow, this would be so fun if I had some buds to play this game with."" Sure enough this game was already equipped with a Multiplayer from Launch! At first that seems amazing, but then once you start getting a total of 4 players and even sometimes 2 players, the servers lag tremendously, my friends and I both checked and we came to the conclusion that it was in fact server side lag, now I know the game came out almost a week ago, but I think that Dedicated Servers should be a rather largepriority for a game of this proportion. Overall, the Multiplayer in this game is rather flawless when I doesn't lag, it makes for an amazing experience with friends and it has so much potentiallike the rest of this game. My rating for the Multiplayer alone is a solid:8/10- This rating due to the Server Side Lag, which can be fixed in the future, otherwise, its spotless. Priorities";26 January, 2016;

Multiplayer is laggy but still pretty fun, great for just messing around and having a laugh really. Overall would recommend, but remember at the moment it pretty much is just a building game, there's no objective or 'game'. You have to make your own fun, make your own missions and stuff.

Wolvesville;Inside;NOT INFORMED;50 people found this review helpful; Recommended 3.1 hrs on record;"I've been playing this game since 4 years on and off now. To everyone who likes the original, this a must play. There are a great fortune of positives:- Next to the original roles, there are dozens of new and interesting roles that influence the game in unique ways. - Not enough players to play Werwolf? Here you'll never run out of players!- As I'm writing this, nearly everything is unlockable in F2P (Gems for skins can be earned gradually by playing, battlepasses can be purchased with the main currency)- You can unlock more complicated roles of the base roles that can be chosen instead, if you dont like the originals- A great community. In all of my time playing, I've been surprised again and again with how fun some people on game can be. (Lets hope the steam release doesn't change this!)- Hackers? Never heard of em!- ""Crazy Games"" events every weekend that change up the core loop of games (The gamemode is voted for on Wolvesville Discord)- Competitive Games, for people who like to have a challenge- Dozens of community-made skins, Clans, sandbox games, a ton of events, constant updates, great communication from the developers and moreOf course, there are also some downsides to the game:- It's pretty hard to get into the game and learn all of the roles as well as terms Wov players use. It's like playing Among Us without knowing what ""sus"" means- Gaining gems and some quests can take a lot of time- Winning as certain roles is really hard, but feels really rewarding if you do win and some roles are pretty passive and don't have a lot to do (every role has some form of ability though)- Sometimes people randomly vote. This is more common in ""fast games"" and can be annoying, but most players ignore it.Interested? Great! Before you start playing I'd like to give you these tips:- You will loose. A lot. This is normal and nothing to worry about- Ask if you don't understand something, there is almost always someone willing to help";1 September, 2023;

I am a single father raising my son, who is now 14 years old. My son won this game from his uncle, so we installed him on his computer and he started playing. Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my survivor and level and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son.; 13 February;

Wolvesville;VitaminaC;56 products in account;20 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 2.0 hrs on record;Wolvesville, in theory, could have been an enjoyable game if only the developers showed a modicum of interest in fixing the numerous bugs plaguing the user experience. Unfortunately, it seems like the only thing the developers care about is squeezing every last dime out of their players, leaving the game riddled with frustrating issues that go unaddressed.Wolvesville has not only failed in creating an enjoyable gaming experience but has also cultivated a toxic community that tarnishes any potential fun. The game's forums and in-game chat are rife with negativity, harassment, and an overall hostile atmosphere that makes playing a thoroughly unpleasant ordeal.Attempting to report concerns about staff behavior or actions feels like an exercise in futility. Whether it's instances of favoritism, unprofessional conduct, or other questionable practices, the feedback falls on deaf ears. The lack of transparency and responsiveness from the staff regarding these reports creates an environment where players feel ignored and disrespected.In conclusion? Don't play this game; 17 January;

The game revolves around strategic decision-making, bluffing, and deduction as players try to figure out who among them are the dangerous werewolves hiding in plain sight.One of the game's key features is its focus on player interaction, as it encourages discussions, debates, and sometimes even heated arguments as players try to identify the werewolves while protecting the innocent villagers. The game also includes various special abilities and roles, adding layers of complexity and excitement to each round.The game's concept draws inspiration from classic party games like Mafia and Werewolf, but adds its own unique twists and mechanics to create a fresh and engaging experience.With its easy-to-grasp gameplay and high replay value, Wolvesville is a fantastic choice for game nights and gatherings, providing hours of fun and memorable moments.

Builders of Greece;MiAh;NOT INFORMED;166 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 1.6 hrs on record;I see the negative reviews here and the positive reviews here. Neither side is wrong per say. The game has a great foundation but in it's current state it's not something exceptional either.I give it a thumbs up because it does what it sets out to do. It's not a bad little game, it just needs some time and some more work done on it.It's your classic city builder simulation in a style similar to Banished. But Unlike in Banished here you have a tech tree and a military branch with troops you can build and use to defend your base. So it's a lot like most city builders but it does try to change things up a little bit and give you more variety. Plus some of it's management mechanics are kinda interesting thus letting you build your city more or less in a way you'd like in a casual comfortable environment.As I said earlier, it does have it's issues. Taxes are an issue, population is an issue, speed is an issue and there's little to no micromanagement of your civilization. It just needs some more work is all imo.If you'd like a more in-depth look at the game please check out the video on my YouTube Channel (link below).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kX86DiyE_4Otherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely.; 27 February;

I refer to the review by Coconut, who mentions some very important points in his summary. In addition to his observations, I have added many of my own suggestions for improvement.

Bravestarr series (yes, the one with the horse that puts out a ??????? shotgung to blast Tex Hex)So decades later we are here, TV shows the movies every holiday (i don't know why Spencer & Hill beating up bad guys equals Easter or Christmas but apparently it does) and we love the movies, especially in german. It's hard to explain why they were so popular since outside a few european countries they never made it, in the US they are not that well know, despite a lot of their movies taking place in mostly Florida and Bud Spencer took his name from Bud, the beer (the same as Bud Bundy....the czech real bud is so much better on a side note) and Spencer Tracy and Terence Hill took his name from a list of stuff. They first started on Hannibal in side-roles in 1959 and soon later became a duo, i think the best duo since Laurel & Hardy, the best Tag Team since the Road Warriors (trust me, i recreated them in several wrestling games) and legends who made a ton of money outside Hollywood (yes, that's possible!)Onto this game that is the first time Spencer and Hill are on a screen since their 1994 movie (Botte di Nattale/Troublemakers/The Fight before Christmas) and the last time since Bud Spencer died in 2016Let's cut to the chase: What we have here is a classic sidescroling Beat 'em Up in the style of Streets of Rage, Final Fight or Double Dragon. If you played those, you know how to play this game with the difference that you have a constant ai controlled partner on your hand (kinda like Double Dragon Neon) and you can switch betwen Bud and Terence. The gameplay is as retro as the graphics, you punch your way through the crowd, drink some beer or pans with beans to replenish your health, you have a special move (Bud's classic";19 April, 2018;
Bud Spencer & Terence Hill - Slaps And Beans;CorvusCorax;1,579 products in account;89 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 13.3 hrs on record;In the discussion thread belonging to this game somebody started to rage asking why oh why we have to accept such games when Street Rage 4 is already out. For the answer head over to the wiki for Carlo Pedersoli and Mario Girotti and check what they accomplished under the nicknames of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. They had their own movies but the majority of the viewers like (and watch up to this date) the journeys they made as a duo. Now, Slaps And Beans is an homage. Interestingly, it has its own story but each stage makes you recognise one or several of the duo's films. In a nutshell, our heroes participate in a movie shoot and when trying to pick up their money for the job they find themselves in the middle of a kidnapping. Terence is immediately concerned about the well-being of the kidnapped lady while Bud only agrees to the rescue as he firmly believes their money is, too, kidnapped.It's a beat 'em up alright. You move from screen to screen and eliminate your foes. Our heroes execute basic and heavy attacks, run and can even defend themselves. The story requires the presence of both (due to the many dialogues) so even if you're alone your A.I. buddy will accompany you. It should be noted that your computer companion plays pretty well. The downside is that in case you're down he will not revive you. It is game over and you start over from the checkpoint. Playing with a friend is your best bet.Slapping an enemy is most satisfying. You will recognise the sound effects from the movies and we haven't even discussed the soundtrack! The album is found in the main menu under jukebox which allows you to just listen to the score the guys re-recorded. In line with the films there are other activities you can do (minigames) at certain areas and every 2 or 3 levels end in a boss battle. The game is not as difficult as a typical beat 'em up is. Once you're done with the medium setting you can pick hard - it is, actually, an even more satisfying experience (not counting the endgame boss battle, though).Are you Italian? German or perhaps Hungarian? The guys were famous in several Western-European countries and they are quite well known in post-socialist countries, too. Change the language setting and hear those famous lines in your language, the ones that people tend to quote even today. And perhaps even US folks know them as they started in the spaghetti western genre (some time after the Leone & Eastwood trilogy) and several of their movies were shot in Florida. If you know these folks Slaps And Beans is a must. Otherwise stick to Street Rage.*edit* I forgot to add that the co-op functionality only exists locally. However, Steam's Remote Play can help and remedy this issue. With a similar local co-op game myself and my buddy experienced stuttering when it comes to Slaps And Beans this feature worked flawlessly. Remote Play allows you to join your friend without launching (and, in fact, owning) the game itself. Say goodbye to progress and achievements - you have to do it in your own later own.;10 October, 2021;

Those songs ""try"" to get the feeling of the original songs, but imho they are not that good. Dooesn't matter, the composers did their best, and it is just a few sequences where those pieces are heard.The dialouges (at least the german version) are packed with quotes and punchlines (no pun intended) from the movies, plus quite a few quotes from not even related movies (*Spoiler*: ""I need your boots, your jacket and your motorcylce!"").The levels, as said, are inspired by the movies, therefore you can find lots of small things (posters etc) in the background which hint to the movies. Also the enemies are designed (mostly) after the movie villains, which makes them go to sleep even more satisfying.The graphics, at last, are nice pixel-art style, you either like it or not.Long story short: If you like the Spencer/Hill movies, give this game a try. In my opinion the people behind this overall did a wonderful job, catching the feeling of the movies. I doubt there was an enormous budget for this game, but everywhere you can see that the creative minds behind this were real fans who put their heart in their work.";4 July, 2019;

Bud & Terrence were a huge part of our childhood, and this game so far pulls all the right strings. The graphics are an amazing tribute to the 90s arcade beat'em ups like Double Dragon, yet lovingly feel like out of the classic Spencer & Hill movies. The sound effects of the slaps are taken right out of the movies - and of course Bud's ""Whack-a-mole"" isn't missing either!

Bud Spencer & Terence Hill - Slaps And Beans;inFranundo;7,088 products in account;17 people found this review helpful; Recommended 6.3 hrs on record;POSITIVE POINTS:- The sound is amazing.- It boasts a very neat pixel art style.- It has several fun mini-games that make the game very varied.- The sense of humour is always present.- It's the closest thing to playing a Bud Spencer and Terence Hill movie.NEGATIVE POINTS:- Unfortunately some of the mini-games are too repetitive. The one about delivering blows indoors can cause a bug where the controller shuts down.- Not being able to play with a friend.- There is little variety of weapons, and animations.- Can get more repetitive than others in the genre.CONCLUSIONS:It's a hilarious ‘me versus the neighbourhood’ game, which gains a lot if you're a fan of the protagonists and if you play with a friend. It consists of twelve stages inspired by different movies of the main characters, with mini-games in each one of them: some of them are 10, like the hot dog and beer games, and others get too repetitive, like the button mashing or the shooting with the gun.It's a game especially focused on playing with a friend, but if you don't have anyone to play with, the AI handles the second character, which you can use at any time. It doesn't have online, but it does have Play Together, so if you have the game you can invite a friend to play it with you thanks to Steam, without any lag.EVALUATION:6,5/10.;16 February, 2021;

Nuclear Blaze;Endyo;1,716 products in account;31 people found this review helpful; Recommended 2.1 hrs on record;I’ve always wondered why there weren’t more firefighting games, but the more I encounter, the less hope I have for the concept. Yet, one finally managed to create mechanics that feel like you’re putting out fire that propagates and is fun to play in the process. Nuclear Blaze not only achieves this, but within its short span, it manages to have an interesting and surprising narrative to go along with it.Abbreviated Review: https://youtu.be/KR2EmoPAYEoRoasting in the DepthsAlthough the game starts you from a helicopter, it’s not long before you enter into an underground facility where you spent most of the game. The cramped corridors and passageways of the facility you enter serve to make sure you’re never too far away from the deadly fire that you’re there to extinguish. The purpose of this location isn’t revealed until you’re well within it, but it ends up making what may have been a relatively mundane story pretty interesting – despite only being a tiny part of the experience.If you’re familiar with the SCP Foundation – a collection of mysterious and sometimes quite scary stories cataloged online – you’ll find some obvious connections here. You’ll probably recognize a slight variation on the iconic symbol for the organization plastered around. There have been plenty of games that delve into that practically limitless lore, but even though this isn’t directly derived from it, it does explore it conceptually really well. It doesn’t lean too heavily into it though. There are plenty of notable and cool little references throughout (including some secrets), but the game shines on the experience of the gameplay.The Fighting of FiresStarting out, you’re equipped with a seemingly magical water cannon that may bring back some memories of Super Mario Sunshine. Much like that tropical adventure, you’ll also need to refill it from water sources as you play. However, in the beginning, it can only fire water horizontally – which of course is sufficient for the initial encounters. On your journey to getting all of the fires doused and suppression systems reactivated, you’ll slightly expand your capabilities. Soon you’ll be able to aim your stream at more angles and envelop yourself in an umbrella of moistened safety – which you’ll have to do regularly as fires flash over from open doors.The fires themselves will propagate if left unattended and can reignite previously extinguished areas if you don’t completely stop them. Many areas have fire-sensing doors that won’t open until the area is clear, so this is often one of the more challenging aspects of the game. Further along, you’ll find areas with electrified surfaces lit aflame, and hitting them with your stream will shock you. So you have to fight your way to their power source and shut them down. There are even parts with explosive objects that will countdown to detonation if they’re left stranded in the inferno.The number of mechanics delivered within Nuclear Blaze makes it kind of disappointing that it’s so short. I would have been happy with twice as much content even if it just explored more of the mechanics already available. By the time you get to more complex parts with key cards and switching on water pumps, you’re already headed into the ending parts of the game.The Ending Parts of the GameI don’t want to spoil anything here, but the Nuclear Blaze introduces some unique encounters toward the end of the game. They weren’t unwelcome by any means, but they were surprising and fun - which again made me want more. I feel like the duration is the single aspect of this game that I can say could have been improved. The mechanics are solid throughout and the use of the SCP-like set-pieces is a great inclusion. When I finished the game, I felt like there might be more content featuring the type of gameplay I just completed. However, it shows up just long enough for you to enjoy it, and then it’s over.(Side note, as of completing this I just found out a New Game+ mode is coming with additional content and challenges – so that may help resolve this issue.)In addition to the regular campaign, it has a “kid mode” which is just a handful of separate short levels that let you run around with auto-aiming water hoses while taking no damage. The idea here, of course, is to have something simple that children could play to put out fires and save cats. So that’s nice and wholesome.Even with the limited length, Nuclear Blaze was a pleasure to play. I don’t think I could have expected much less from the creator of Dead Cells. It’s appropriately priced even being only a couple of hours long because of the raw quality throughout. It delivers the familiarity of platforming and basic exploration with firefighting mechanics that are fun to use all sitting within a memorable premise. It should appeal to most, but I’m sure it will appeal to people afraid of short games when it inevitably goes on sale in the future. This is probably a good game to grab at full price though if you don’t have that phobia. Or I suppose a fear of fire?

Nuclear Blaze;krayzkrok;993 products in account;15 people found this review helpful; Recommended 2.6 hrs on record;Wow, this was really great. It's a 2D platforming game where your main enemy is simply fire, and you have to put it out with your portable hose and backpack, refilling at regularly spaced stations. It works because the fire is alive, spreading up walls, across ceilings and into adjacent rooms as you'd expect, and you have to approach it tactically especially later in the game with more complex rooms, valves to open, gas mains to turn off, and more. From this simple concept the devs spin a solid two hour adventure, introducing a handful of extra abilities as you go, and really squeezing the maximum possible out of the core concept.The graphics are nicely done here, especially in use of colour, light and highlights. When the fire is really raging, the screen glows an angry orange and you really start to feel the heat. And once it's out, a satisfying blue hue envelops everything. Music complements the action nicely.If I had a criticism it would be a late-game addition that can be a little frustrating, often sending you back to the last checkpoint with little warning, but once you learn to deal with it, frustration levels subside somewhat. Still, it took many, many attempts to beat the epic fire in the penultimate area.Props to the devs for including a kid mode, where the objective is to simply rescue some lost kittens from burning buildlings. You can't die in kid mode, and aiming and movement are greatly simplified.At 2+ hours the game does perhaps leave you wanting at its conclusion, but it's such a great 2 hours that it feels satisfying and complete. There's some replayability if you want to find all the secret rooms and rescue all the kittens, and some difficulty tweaks in the settings, but it's going to play out largely the same.;30 October, 2021;

Nuclear Blaze;Sherlock_B0nes;NOT INFORMED;8 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 1.8 hrs on record;Nuclear Blaze is a very short game relative to the purchase price. Although I enjoyed myself while playing, I beat the game in under 2 hours and the only reason I suspect someone might replay this title is for the achievements - gathering what remaining collectibles you missed during your first playthrough. The game has great pixel art, solid sound design, and an interesting premise but there just isn't enough content to justify the financial investment. Nuclear Blaze seems like it would be a worthwhile game for someone purposely seeking out a quick 'one-and-done' experience or for young kids (aged 5-12) but only if you can get a copy of the game for $3 USD or less.;7 March, 2022;
Nuclear Blaze;TwentyOne;557 products in account;5 people found this review helpful; Recommended 9.6 hrs on record;"NOTE ABOUT LINUX PLAYABILITY:While the store page says that the game runs on Linux, it doesn't really have a fully functioning working port yet as of today (2022-12-25).There's a linux-capable executable in the files that works like a charm when started from the folder (apart from that it sometimes doesn't recognizes the controller and that you can't open the steam overlay in-game), but won't start if you start it from steam itself, even as a non-steam game. Proton works like a charm, as long as you choose OpenGL over DirectX on startup.Nuclear Blaze is that sort of game where you feel like replaying it all over again right when you end it.Not only because of the collectables (cats, more of that later), but also because it was so much fun and challenging that makes you feel you need just a little bit of extra content.It also has a kid mode, so even if you have someone who rarely plays games or hasn't really played much before (e.g. kids), they can get some enjoyment out of the game thanks to a set of separate and simplified levels.The mechanics are rather straightforward, and the upgrades are just as simple. What they add are just normal features, which is why you get them so early on (apart from one, and even then it's just a water tank size upgrade and nothing more). The main challenge comes how you tackle the fires however. Fire will spread to nearby surfaces and might reignite areas you already extinguished. It might sound daunting, but the game mechanics don't make it too tough to at least survive, especially since it's easy to keep you alive (apart from those semi-timed segments, but those are always rather short).Also, this game makes collectables pretty neat. While some cats are really hidden away, you'll know when there is one in the level thanks to these little tunnels at the end of each level. The game also always lets you backtrack enough into a level that finding the cat is always possible even when you already can leave the level.The ""Hold My Beer"" mode (AKA new game+) adds some extra challenges, such as autoturrets, less effective help from the levels and changed level layouts. It makes the game a bit more enjoyable to replay it.The only criticisms I have is that for one, it really needs a level editor, as the game's levels just isn't quite enough I feel and I would love to play more of it. Another one is that the last segment is a bit meh, simply because it's less conventional compared to the other levels and it's sort of cheesable. But even at full price this game is great.";25 December, 2022;

It is perfect for every bookworm with a Lovecraft kink and for people who like detectives. Here is my list of pros and contras:Pros- The story - it is amazing with a lot of Lovecraft references- The atmosphere - with a good story and a beautiful world comes a good atmosphere- Characters and their acting- Fights - for the 1st half of the game they were REALLY difficult and I tried to avoid them - that is how it has to be for a newcomer who sees the abominations fot the 1st time. Then I got more experience and ammo and fights became passable- Gameplay - if you select the hard difficulty then you will really have to use your head to pass the cases, as you need to search and think a lot (it could be not an advantage for someone)Contras- The whole game feels a bit unfinished - crowd behaves very strangely (like in Cyberpunk after release), some textures are broken (but as I said, overall the world still feels real)- Choices - sadly, they do not really matter (but it was actually a pleasure for my ego to remain a fair guy and help people, heh)- Character leveling system is poor and boring- Gameplay starts feeling very repetitive after 20th hourSo, as I said, if you read any Lovecraft's tale once (I've read like 30+ of them) and you find his worlds fascinating then just RELAX, BUY THIS ON SALE AND ENJOY.

I paid £16 for this game (if I remember correctly). I was looking forward to it because it had been quite some time since I had had an immersive Lovecraftian experience (Dark Corners of the Earth is still top). Call of Cthulhu had some good stuff in it, but it felt more like a series of mini events, very constrained, and too handholdy. So here comes an open world Lovecraftian adventure boasting a very thematic, immersive worldmap and a hard challenge for the hardened adventurers...I'm afraid it doesn't quite deliver though. The TL.DR is only buy this game if you're craving for more Lovecraft and it's on sale. do not pay more than £7 or so. It doesn't deliver because, quite frankly, it feels like an unfinished game on too many levels. I understand there was some sort of publisher-related drama on steam, but as far as I know the console vesion and the Sherlock series suffer from similar flaws.First the positive, because there are positives:;1 March, 2023;
The Sinking City;n0ughty;NOT INFORMED;154 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 50.5 hrs on record;"I almost didn't buy it after reading the flood of negative reviews, what I found is a lovingly crafted atmosphere along with rich storytelling and immersive gameplay.This game has extremely dark themes. self harm, family abuse, racial injustice etc. On the other hand there is also some clever dark humour. The genre is a mix of Detective, RPG and Survival Horror. I guess some of the negativity comes from people who only wanted one of those things.A common complaint seems to be ""The Combat"" and I have no idea what their problem is, I found it to be a very simple and intuitive experience with satisfying gunplay. At first it can be intense but is very easy to figure out and it is not punishing at all, if you do somehow die it just reloads the last checkpoint which is never far away. The concept of limited resources is executed perfectly imo, I always seem to have just enough bullets to survive a situation and it feels rewarding to be prepared, scouring for more when needed. Venturing into barricaded streets marked as ""infested area"" is one way to find more but is completely optional so it's funny to see that complained about too. You can also earn from side missions (they're actually good too) and search any empty houses you come across.The only really bad thing in this game is ""Optimization"", it lags sharply at some moments but at least stabilizes itself pretty quickly. I can see how frustrating it is hand-in-hand with having a combat system at all, since it is prone to happen when a new area and several enemies spawn all at once, but I see it as it's own separate issue, besides it never actually caused me to die. The Detective work in this game is generally pretty easy but not always. It lets go of your hand sometimes and you just have to read through the clues you collected so far and piece together where to investigate next e.g. you may need to look up a birth record or business address at the newspaper or city hall archives, I felt a real sense of accomplishment in figuring these things out. Naturally this type of game requires some patience and attention span, to fully appreciate the depths of the story and cases. For me the most tedious part is to go over some crime scenes with a fine-toothed comb to collect every clue, but at least the game tells you once everything has been found in an area.Traversal can also be daunting at first but gets easier when you find all the phone booths to ""fast travel"" between, it's such a detailed environment anyway that it can be nice to just soak in on a boat ride or jog while thinking about your next step. In 30 hours I beat my first play-through of the main story alongside about 7 side missions (it's a good idea to multi-task them) However this is one of those games that doesn't return you to the open world after the final mission, so make sure to do a manual save a bit before the finale.I will also give it a replay anyway since there are many multiple choice moments with interesting plot results.In conclusion I highly recommend giving The Sinking City a chance if it calls to you.";22 December, 2023;

The Sinking City;Karavolos;NOT INFORMED;No one has rated this review as helpful yet; Recommended 37.5 hrs on record;"Foreword is that I liked the game, but don't suggest buying it on Steam, hence the thumbs down. Why? Because as I hear there's been some legal issues were Frogware accuses Nacon/BigBen Interactive of having stolen their game, uploaded it themselves and ran off with the profits. Now, I'm just a layman with no idea how that legal process went, so grain of salt, but I am inclined to believe it given the issues the game has had with missing content and the odd end credits where you get one from Frogware and a separate one from BBI. Sus.If you don't care about outside factors like this and only want the game, or just find it too much of a hassle, no judgement from me. I just want you to make an informed decision. If you do wanna support Frogware, I hear Origin and Gamesplanet (sites I don't use myself, mind you) sell the Frogware version of the game.==EDIT==Due to Frogware becoming the sole publisher of TSC, I've changed my rating to a thumbs up.Gameplay: 6/10Anyways I had some fun with The Sinking City, I especially enjoy the investigation gameplay and how you need to look up the streets and pin your own map pointers, giving it a feeling of doing your research. Combat wasn't very good, but thankfully the game gives you two separate difficulty rating to modify, one for combat and one for the investigations, so I could reduce the burden and make it not interfere too much with bulletspongy enemies I've already encountered multiple times in the first half of the game alone. There isn't a great deal of variation of enemies you face.The way you follow clues from one to the other is usually by trying to investigate various places from crime scenes to residences to monster-infested abandoned sites to try and locate clues of various kinds. You also possess a sixth sense vision of sorts which slowly drains your sanity to use, but may grant you supernatural insights into the scenes from giving you a vision into the past to peering past illusionary walls or sometimes to lead you to the clue you need through trippy visions you follow. It depends on the particular mission you're on and is something you follow rather than invoke. Some missions have branching paths, primarily the main missions, and said main missions also have a mechanic where you piece together the clues to form a wider narrative. You also sometimes have to do a bit of research at various archives for things like citizen records or information about books, which you do by piecing together three categories that match what you're searching for. That one took a little getting used to since you got to select the exact part of the mission you wanna research and can't just select the categories wildly to see what sticks, and there wasn't too much of a game or information you'd get out of those archives, but it did provide enough to make your next clue and continue whatever narrative you are on. I guess I wish it had more to it though, either more gameplay to puzzle stuff together, or more reading material that you can uncover extra information from if you do your homework, even if it's just for flavor. Or maybe unlock hidden endings? More work, yeah yeah, but it'd make the game's rating go up a point and leave a more lasting impression and impactful salespitch, that's for sure.Atmosphere: 6/10The city is huge and has a certain attention to detail, which is cool. I loved looking through the streets on the map and gradually familiarize myself with the place, making me feel more and more like a resident. Albeit a new one. What my primary thoughts are though is ""the devs did as much as they could with limited resources."" I find it dark and gloomy which I enjoyed, but I also saw reused assets everywhere, often on the very same street, where the same kind of signs were used multiple times over announcing some old business or so, and while the furniture may change a bit, the layout of every residence picks from a small selection that isn't gonna change much. And also people could pop in or out on the street which is immersion breaking. These things take away from the atmosphere in my opinion, though I still was invested in the story, my role as a private eye (and Charles Reed as a person) and enjoyed the general uneasy feeling in-universe. All in all while the game could use more polish and resources, I never felt like I wasn't part of the world the game presents me.Technical: 8/10I had no strong issues with running the game. Music worked fine, ambient noises were there and played as they should, and I never ran into invisible walls or bugs that I can remember. My main issue? I had to mod the game files, with some effort, to be able to walk. Give me a damn walk button, especially in a game like this when I need to take my time to explore smaller areas for details! Once I got that solved, I had no further issues with the game. But I do understand some content is or were missing from the steam version, so I'd subtract a point from that. Maybe I could argue it's mildly annoying how you can't save at the exact spot you want, but rather get thrown to the nearest checkpoint (with all the items and clues you've gathered intact, mind you), but I won't go as far as subtract a point for it.Overall Rating: 6/10I had fun, I was intrigued and I enjoyed going through the story. Endings weren't much to write home about and left me wanting. Combat was lame, investigations were fun. But most of all, now that I've played through it, I don't feel much need to revisit it again. I know what goes down, I know all of the mysteries unless I missed a side-quest somewhere and I know the story ends. Would I recommend it? If you like investigation gameplay and/or the Cthulhu Mythos sure. If you are more action-oriented, not really for you. What I can say is the only regret I have for my purchase is that I didn't know ahead of time about the Frogware/Nacon legal dispute and am worried, if a bit ignorant and unsure, about my money not going to the right place.";15 May, 2023;

For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do.

If this was years ago.. I would have recommended the game without any question. However, with the game's current state and direction, I could never recommend it to anyone under any circumstance.It's just going downhill and that's the reality of it. They are partnering with anyone in an attempt to stay relevant and keep quarterly stats up but that only lasts for a week and then it's back to being a dead game for the most part.If you ever decide to work at this company, just note that your personal account is at high risk of being permanently banned if you are accused of anything and are wrongfully terminated as a result.They will not only ban your dev account (which is fine) but your personal account as well, which is actual bullsh*t and petty. I'm living proof of this.They won't conduct a proper and thorough investigation behind their claims before terminating an employee and will sh*t all over your 6-years of dedicated gameplay, time spent and work into a product that you once loved and cared for to the point that you even took a job to work on the game to make it better not just for yourself but for the community who also loves the game.Clueless company making clueless decisions on a game that they're clueless about since they don't play it.I was one of the literal few at the company who has more than 4,000 hours of actual gameplay in the game.P.S. they still haven't fixed the IP leak vuln that has been the cause of people being DDoSed, doxed, swatted and much more. They've known about it for over 2 years now and refuse to fix something so simple while knowing what the root cause of it is and know what exactly to fix.Just to give you an idea of how little they care... I brought this up before and during my time working there and it was never fixed. We're now going into 2023 with this vulnerability that's been in the game for over 4+ years.Still think BHVR cares about you now? Their main focus is and always has been to make money and that's why this issue has never been addressed even though their own Fog Whisperers like Otzdarva, Elix and many others have questioned why they haven't fixed it yet and are victims to these issues.Their priorities are all over the place and have no idea how to run a game company let alone keep the community safe. It's pretty evident that these are the facts.They would rather ban innocent people than to solve the huge security risks and flaws in the game. It's disgusting and this type of ""behaviour"" should not be condoned.I'm more surprised Valve/Steam is even allowing the game to remain playable on their platform considering the company refuses to fix these issues that is allowing these events take place.Cheaters? I won't get into that. Everyone knows the answer to this already.

I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game!

Manor Lords;Bob;NOT INFORMED;2,604 people found this review helpful23 people found this review funny; Recommended 29.2 hrs on record;The best medieval-ish city builder. I happen to be a historian specialising in the Middle Ages, and games that market themselves as “historically authentic” often leave a lot to be desired as such games often don’t even try to emulate the time period beyond basic aesthetics. Since a lot of the hype around Manor Lords comes from its commitment to historical accuracy, I'll be reviewing it from that perspective. This game, although there is room for improvement, is clearly an earnest attempt to enable players to recreate reasonably authentic medieval towns and villages and gets closer to that goal than any of its rivals. After spending about a dozen hours building a large town, it's very much unfinished but what's there is good. There is currently one map with some RNG elements, such as your starting location and the starting location of a rival lord who also wants this land and whom you will eventually have to fight. You will build houses which can, as was typical in the Middle Ages, have a productive plot of land to the rear for a vegetable garden or household animals like goats or a chicken coop, and the system for building them is intuitive, flexible, and a joy to use. You’ll have to manage trade with off-map settlements as well as maintain a militia to deal with bandits or the rival lord. On the whole, I really like it. There are some issues with the mechanics of the game:1. There is no way (that I can find) to limit the production of certain goods without micromanaging employment. It would be good to say “have a stockpile of 50” like you can in other settlement management games, and like you can with the trading system. I would like to not have to micromanage 14 houses just to regulate what planks are used for. 2. Combat is trivial assuming rough parity between the size of the armies. You have to try to lose a battle to lose a battle. 3. Bandit raids on your village happen off screen a lot of the time. Like, you can’t defend your settlement, you just get a notification that you’ve lost goods to bandits. Let us defend ourselves please, or let us have a bailiff to reign in the thieves. 4. Trade is overpowered, you can get to a point where the player can run the whole settlement through trade. Trade has no risks, so the game steers the player toward relying on trade rather than managing their villages. 5. The rival lord expands far too aggressively, even on its lowest settings. By the time you can claim a single neighboring parcel of land, you’ll be lucky not to have been boxed in completely. The AI takes one parcel a year, there are 8 provinces, and it starts with two while you start with one. This means that by year 5 the AI has the map locked down entirely while you’re still trying to get a decent harvest in. This sucks and is the game’s biggest problem right now. The game has a remarkable ability to enable the player to create authentic medieval town layouts, and you could probably recreate some medieval towns in the game pretty accurately. However, the game seems to be based on central Europe around 1400, so it does tend to lean toward villages and towns from that time and place. While you can emulate, for example, Norman town planning with its focus on commercial high/fore streets, you cannot build a medieval Italian town in this game because plazas are not a thing (yet), while building a village around a central green would be aesthetic rather than the functional heart of the village. This leads on to an area where the game and its commitment to historical accuracy will hopefully improve as development continues, which is forest and land management. In most medieval-ish town planning games (this one included) you put down a logging hut and they just cut down trees, then a forester plants new trees. This is not how medieval people generally managed their woodland, if only because it’s remarkably inefficient prior to mechanised forestry. Although the villages are historically authentic, the same effort has not been put into those villages’ relationship with the land (yet). Some suggestions:1. Coppicing. Coppicing was the practise of cutting a tree down to the stump to stimulate the growth of shoots around the stump, essentially tricking one tree into growing many trees. This would result in a large amount of harvestable wood within 7-10 years. However, the shoots were vulnerable to being eaten by deer.2. Pollarding. The same idea as coppicing, but it’s done about 2m up the tree trunk. You get less wood that’s harder to access, but deer won’t eat it. 3. Deeper deer management. Of course, if deer keep eating everything you could just kill all the deer. Deer culling was (and still is) an important part of forestry. Although the game does have deer management it is as simple as “don’t over-hunt”. It would be good to see this expanded to reflect the real world impacts of deer overpopulation or underpopulation.4. Wolf management. When creating new villages, they often encroached on the habitats of wolves. Wolves don't usually attack people, but if they get used to human contact and become habituated, they do. A mechanic for wolf packs similar to deer migration (except rather than going further away when bothered, they attack) might work well. It would be nice to fight something other than the tropey RNG bandit camp. It’s got a lot of promise, I’m sure I’ll enjoy sinking hundreds of hours into it over the years, but you might want to wait a year or so until it’s further along development.; 26 April Ea;

The bite rates have been nerfed to 1/4 - 1/3 of what they were previously, and most locations are now thoroughly boring. Some are not even possible to break even at within the bounds of the game economy.Some of us have paid literally hundreds of dollars for permanent licenses for these locations so that we could continue to enjoy them when we got bored of the higher level waterways. This is a nasty bait-and-switch tactic in my eyes. They've made severe alterations to waterways that have been in play for years and alot of us have paid good money to have permanent access to. It has cut a huge amount of the replay value out of this game. It's broken the game to the point where I would not recommend it to anyone. Period.How hard is it to figure out that no matter how good the eye candy, or how good a simulation it is, nobody wants to play a fishing game where you don't catch anything? Who wants to play a game where you're forced by the game economy into fishing the same 3 locations over and over?Anyways - this is a thoroughly bad game now if you're not playing at one of the remaining 3 waterways that have not been nerfed to the point of irrelevance. There was an out previously for people who didn't like the direction the ""F2P"" version of this game was going. You could spend $40 on The Fisherman, and get the older and much more enjoyable version of Fishing Planet. The dev team decided to break that as well with the last update so most of us are now looking for a different game.Edit - there are fewer than half as many people playing the game as there were 3 weeks ago. I wonder why.";5 October, 2020;

The mechs where realistic looking and the game had general balance. It felt futuristic to just a small enough extent to not feel more like starwars rather than current year. It was good. P2W still existed but to a much smaller scale. If your team played together and ganged up on them than you could still beat them. It has all changed. There are more mechs than anyone but the top players know of, same for the weapons. If you win enough and get put up a rank then you start to get hit by things you don't even know the name of, nearly killing you before you can even get a shot off. Attempting to get the same stuff takes either LITERAL YEARS to achieve, or a large sum of money. There is a deal I was offered recently in-game, of receiving a trebuchet and a few hundred gold. The trebuchet weapon, a heavy class that in the days that I played nearly everyday used to be one of if not the best weapons in the game. This gun is now bad, it's damage is minuscule compared to most others and the cost to upgrade it is ridiculously high in silver. This brilliant deal of an outdated weapon and a measly amount of gold that won't even get you one light weapon comes at the price of $59.90 AUD. For that price, I could buy an indescribable number of better games. It can buy you Forsaken from Destiny 2 and still leave $20 left. The pricing for this game is absolutely ridiculous. PIXONIC (devs) have taken a game they made great and turned it into literally the most unbalanced, pay to win """"""strategy"""""" I have ever seen. I miss the old days of this game. I wish it could return to it, but we can't. PIXONIC is a money-hungry company only intent on selling you nothing at high prices, likely to be completely overshadowed by the next update dropping a new, OP mech and weapons.

TL.DR: This game has worse practices than EA, them being a ??????? blessing in comparison.Get ready for a ??????? long read. Im going to explain everything in depth and its flaws the best i can.-This “game”, has tuned all of its features to purposely to push the player into frustration and incite them into spending money. That is literally their scheme.To exploit this even further, their current profit strategy is to release absurdibly broken new mechs, which blast through the meta of the game, and push the players into buying the new content to compete with other players. This isnt your regular case of pay2win, this is p2w to MAXIMUM HYPEROVERDRIVE.No game has ever, and i say, ever, made me so frustrated with its progression. I played my huge share of grindy games, and they dont come nowhere as close as this game. Progression was slow but palpable. On this game, it breaks your shins and leaves you for yourself.War robots has no form of progression because it restricts you in every single way it can.Upgrade a mech or one individual piece of equipment. It costs silver and some wait time which increases exponentially with each level. At first glance this seems kind of normal for a mobile based free game, but thats where it lies, because it reaches a point where upgrades take literally days, leaving you with unequal levels with your equipment because you have to upgrade them one by one.And this is just a bit of the problem.Because what should be more available equipment, is locked behind gold, which is the premium currency, with 5€ giving you 500 gold as a example.Most of this equipment which are practically upgraded versions of some of the starting weapons of the game, and they are locked behind this gold currency.

Back then, one or two years after the release it was really great, without that much P2W, really a masterpiece. I mean, there were weapons and robots that you were able to buy with real currency, but they were balanced, kinda OP, but still balanced. But then, suddenly, it all has fallen apart. The developers started adding more and more purchasable content, and it was NOT balanced anymore. And still not is. I mean, I am a true fan of this game, I had both Fuijin and Raijin (best robots back then) back in the days, and I have grinded to buy them around 100hrs I think. But suddenly, they weren't the best anymore. Pixonic started adding more and more OP purchasable contents. The game that I really loved became another P2W sh*t. Downloading it now, on PC, and looking at it all... I has all gotten worse, as I can see. And thus, no matter how hard I try to vindicate it, my most favourite mobile game, I cannot recommend you to play it. Sadly, but it is how it is.Sorry for this review being so emotional.

I play(ed) this game so much because of the nostalgia it once had and the great concept design. However the developers have turned this into a money farm operation and ruined a game while ignoring calls from players to fix it over the last years. The one key problem is balance. Every month they release a new robot with a set of weapons that decimates everything else in the playing field. To even worsen it, it is not available to the free to play player for at least a year. Even once its available it takes months to build it! By then it doesn't stand a chance against the current meta of the game! This is coming from you with personal experience, as I. in avail put sums of money into this game and am destroyed by those who have put in even more.

When I tried out the game then, I was shocked by all the changes that had been made. Every time you entered the game, you were bombarded by multiple officers, Claiming to be 80-97% off for real money. new robots were released every month or so, which costed HUNDREDS of dollars to obtain, and had game breaking abilities that would allow you to win if you had them, and if you didnt, you would either have to be willing to pay to compete with others or you would get slaughtered. a couple months after these robots were released, they would be nerfed into the ground to make way for the new game breaking robots, and the process would repeat. Although this was extremely frustrating, the game was still fun (not as fun as it was in 2014, when it wasnt pay to win though) However, I ultimately quit after I fell into the trap of actually spending money on this game and not really getting anything out of it. Now, here I am on my computer, as i just remembered this game and I wanted to see what its like now, and its worse then I could have imagined. Forget robots, (although they are still in the cycle of adding OP robots and then nerfing them) Now they have added new types of machines. For example, Motherships, which are completly pay to play and require absolutely no skill. How do they work? Well, you spend a few hundred dollars to upgrade them, and then you click a button to use them in game, and they bypass all of your opponents shields and more or less one shot them. They also never miss. What factor of enjoyment this adds to the game, I do not know, and it seems everyone in the community was against pixonic adding this. unfortunately people are either content creators and have to buy everything in the game, or are just so hopelessly addicted that they dont care anymore and buy everything for the sake of it. Getting to my point, even a couple years ago, I COULD recommend this as a fun game, as long as you dont spend money on it. Now it is completely unplayable and unenjoyable unless you are willing to spend TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS a year to keep up with the meta and all the sh*t they are adding. Went from a 10/10 game to a 0/10, and the saddest thing is how easily pixonic could fix this if they got their priorities straight and started listening to the community.

Mostly, you lack 2-3 cards to be “on meta” for each archetype – so you feel close to have the “perfect deck”.

MARVEL SNAP;Wandering;NOT INFORMED;116 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 83.2 hrs on record;8/10 Since the popularity of Hearthstone, card games influenced by it and Magic, which involve using resources, minions, and spells to battle each other, have been continuously emerging, leading to a homogenization trend within the digital card game sphere. Despite this, Marvel Snap, which essentially modifies and simplifies the board game Smash Up!, still manages to significantly shake up the electronic card game industry. As the winner of the Best Mobile Game at the 2022 TGA, Marvel Snap indeed introduces novel and unique gameplay mechanics. However, its extremely greedy monetization model has also drawn considerable backlash from players.Ben Brode, the game director and former lead designer of the renowned card game Hearthstone, is undoubtedly well-versed in card games and their market. Gameplay-wise, this title shares similarities yet differs from Gwent. Beyond the easy-to-grasp gameplay design and fast-paced matches, the familiar characters from the Marvel Universe, combined with a unique artistic style, bring a strong sense of familiarity to players. The design of most characters' abilities is not only fitting to their images but also filled with interesting and distinctive features. The unique location system adds a layer of randomness and strategy to matches, making deck building based on popular locations and match environments more cost-effective than blindly copying decks. Below the infinite ranks, only players within the same card pool can be matched against each other. Additionally, the Snap system, akin to raising in Texas Hold'em, allows players to flexibly control their score gains and adds an element of betting outside the ground. It's worth mentioning that dynamic animated cards, which are expensive and hard to obtain in most other electronic card games, are relatively easy to acquire in Marvel Snap.The 12-card deck, fast-paced 6-turn battles, and the absence of pre-battle mulligan make luck a very significant factor in Marvel Snap. Often, a slight misjudgment can lead to a loss, and the sense of frustration this brings to players can be quite profound. While players acquire cards quickly in pools 1-2, which can arguably be considered the most balanced period of the game environment, the efficiency of card acquisition drastically decreases after reaching pool 3. Players may end up spending over $100 just for a single card, which undeniably reflects a highly deceptive monetization model. Like most card games, balancing issues with cards are almost inevitable, but this issue is particularly pronounced in Marvel Snap. When certain cards have virtually no chance of being played, coupled with the high acquisition difficulty of pool 4, pool 5, and temporarily limited cards available through passes, it can quickly alter the entire gaming environment in the short term. Furthermore, within these supermodel cards, there are still different levels of strength, leading to a highly distorted game environment.Marvel Snap, which feels more like a board game than a traditional TCG, is definitely worth a try, especially for those who have grown tired of the increasingly homogenized resource-based card games on the market, as well as those looking for a card game to play over the long term. Given the game's high player retention and fast-paced matches, it will likely maintain a very stable player base for a long time. However, its extremely greedy monetization model makes the gameplay experience after pool 3 very poor for most players, and it serves as a crucial point where many decide whether to continue playing or quit. Merely purchasing a few packs in the game often feels like a drop in the bucket in terms of progress, so buying the monthly season passes might be the most cost-effective choice. For any player, investing time and effort into Marvel Snap is an inevitable part of the long-term gameplay experience.Find my reviews valuable?Click here to join my curator group.

I've spent time and money on this game and the developer just took away almost everything I invested in one update. Please read carefully and BE WARNED.I was just in-game looking at one of my favourite tanks. It's a tier 8 premium. Premium meaning I spent enough REAL MONEY on this one tank to buy a full console game for example. Seems crazy but I really like this game. And I like this tank so much that I spent even more real money on a fancy paint job, just to make it look pretty. But I'm just looking at it, not playing it because my tank has been robbed.I've been driving this tank for awhile now, FULLY EQUIPPED and able to go head-to-head against any other tank on a level playing field. And this is not the only tank I've spent money on. Some players spend hundreds even thousands of $$$ on this game. But it's genuinely a great game and few of us regretted it until........update 3.8 happened. My tank. ALL my tanks have been robbed of their equipment.Under the guise of improving the equipment system (which was in no way broken) they have taken away all my equipment, paid for in game currency. To re-equip my tank for peak performance I have to wait for newly-imposed TIMERS to run out which will take MOST OF A MONTH! Or, I can pay even more REAL MONEY to get it now. Don't forget I already paid plenty REAL MONEY for this tank and now they're asking for more, just to get back what I had already.Sounds awful right? But this is not even the worst part. I have a garage full of tanks, we all do. And this update has taken away 100% of our equipment on all tanks and gave us enough compensation (in the form of a brand new alternative currency) to buy only 12% back. Yes, we did the math.To get the rest back we need to grind all over again, and again we did the math. It will take ACTUAL YEARS for many players to recover what they ALREADY EARNED but was taken away. In extreme cases, up to a decade.The more TIME and MONEY you invest in this game is more that the developer can take away from you at any time. That is the bottom line here. So think carefully before playing this game and especially before you spend money on it.;4 May, 2017;

The faith I had for the community is gone. And all of this because of some ""very"" simple reason.My general PoV:The maturity this game once had is dead and now it's just a shell for kids who like to spend 300 euros per month on the premium tanks they make every once or two weeks where they are still not getting creative with the fake names. Competitiveness left when tier 10 premium tanks were added and more and more offers appeared in the shop. Most serious people left the game as soon as they saw where it was heading but I stayed like the sucker I was 2 years ago. The sad and cunning trap these games have is that they make you think your effort in the game counts towards something and if you stop playing you will lose it. After getting 2 tier 10 tanks and a notable amount of premium tanks I came to the realization that the grind is just endless, there is no endgame even if you complete all tech trees, because they will just keep adding more tanks to keep people in the game. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game about 4 times and every time I played it again was in the hope that for once I could have fun. I'm not one of those salty kids who keep blaming their own team when they die first, but the competitive matchmaker and the matchmaker overall don't care about player skill, only for the tank you have. So it's very easy to get matched with someone that has 30-40% WR only because he has a shop tank so that the teams would have a relevant amount of diversity in terms of tank types. The ""endgame"":The meta of this game is either a tech tree tank that takes 4 months to grind or a tier 10 premium tank that occasionally appears in the shop for about 75 euro. It's not like they sell these tanks to fulfill their upkeep costs, but it seems more like milking at this point. I've seen it in many other games and I know what it feels like. 90% of the people you will find as your teammates are toddlers and in a game that requires communication to win makes it clear you can't really depend on someone like that who will just go die only because he didn't want to do what you told him, he lacks common sense and so does the community at this point. The youtube community:Most YouTubers I've seen playing this are not really having fun of it, it may seem like they are having fun but what they had when they first started making videos was gone after a while and was replaced with an advertisement puppet. All this of course is nothing but my pure opinion on what this game has become. Conclusion:It could have been something great if we didn't stick at the mobile plan, because it's the universal truth that free mobile games want to milk your wallet in the end and that's an unhealthy practice at pc gaming. I have found a better community than this at a more fun game of which I won't mention because I'm not an advertiser. If you want a good game and community just look elsewhere, because, ""You picked the wrong house, fool!"".";5 August, 2020;

It's already discounted for 33% off because of poor sales. but if you want the full game you'll need to drop a ridiculous amount of money on DLC anyway, so what the discount actually saves you is closer to 2%.Gameplay:The game is actually pretty fun. They dumbed down some of the controls from previous installments, but it adds a new instant tag out system and still boasts an extraordinary amount of depth. Unfortunately, not all of the new inclusions are as fun in higher level play.The instant tag out system makes it so you're always safe no matter what you do, and playing against strategies that abuse this (every strategy) can be really frustrating. Push blocking is extremely important in this game, as every team can put you in infinite block-strings, and perform infinite mixups without ever giving you a chance to punish.Some pro games seemingly consist almost exclusively of mashing the tag out button. This isn't very fun to play or watch in my opinion.I'm certainly not a pro player so take the above with a grain of salt. it's just my experience with the game and watching a few tournaments.Story Mode:The ""story mode"" is a joke. It's bad fanfiction at best. It lasts a few hours, and 80% of that time is either watching garbage cut-scenes or playing against rinse and repeat ""ultron bots"" or ""corrupted asgardians."" On top of that, just to mess with us, you can plainly see the finished DLC character models in story cut-scenes that you'll need to spend another $40 to actually unlock.Online:The online mode is mediocre, and barely anyone has the game, so finding a match can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few dozen minutes. It has decent netcode, but disconnects make you wait 2-3 minutes staring at a frozen screen, and then treat the game as though it didn't happen. This really gets frustrating as people have DC'd right before losing in around 10 of my matches thus far (That's around 30 minutes of doing nothing). The ""ranking"" system is also terrible. It goes from 15 to 1. There are no meaningful rewards.Mission/ Practice Mode:Mission mode is there and offers 10 missions per character. It's not bad, but around half of the missions involve tag combos, sometimes teaching you nothing about your character. The practice mode is there and it has what you'd expect. you can queue for online while in practice mode.DLC:No surprise here. content is blatantly ripped out of the core game so they can sell it to us as character/costume packs for ridiculous prices at a later date. They really have absolutely no respect for their customers at all.Voice acting/ Character models/ Game presentation:Some of the character models in this game are disgusting. The game itself looks like it belongs on mobile. The voice acting makes playing certain characters impossible (Monster Hunter). Animations are recycled from previous games, but instead of recycling quality voice acting, they hire a bunch of homeless people to redo it.Pros:- Fun game- Decent online netcodeCons:- Mechanics are easily abusable- Everything else about online sucks- Nobody plays the game- It's overpriced- DLC ripped out of base game- Half the character models look like trash- Most of the voice acting is terrible- Bad story mode- No X-Men- No Vergil- No Wesker- No Doctor DoomThis review is biased, and you can probably tell I'm salty.

Kovaaks is a really efficient way of practicing point-and-click mechanics that apply to most modern FPS titles and it is great for players that are moving to PC gaming from console. Be careful how you use the program though. Always focus on improving yourself and don't get heavily emotionally invested into your scores or leaderboard ranks. Look up some good scenarios to play, try them, and if you like them, create your own practice playlist and run through it every single day for at least 45 minutes. I promise. This game is so worth it and your aim will definitely improve. Many other professional FPS coaches would probably agree with me and I've heard many players who've tried Kovaaks and they say it is the best thing to use to practice their aim.

I Am Fish;Wearybat;NOT INFORMED;42 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 5.9 hrs on record;"Y'know, I really, really want to like I Am Fish, and if it weren't for how inconsistent the game's mechanics actually felt to use, I almost might.Set in the same universe as I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator (No, I'm being serious. they're all in a collective universe, apparently.), I Am Fish is a puzzle-platformer where you control four separate fish to the ocean, where they will be free to swim all day and be friends together. Yahoo. Look, the set-up isn't what's unique about this title. it's the execution. See, I Am Fish's central gimmick is that its a physics based platformer. It's not enough to simply traverse the level, but instead, you have to fight the controls of the game itself to get each fish from point A to point B. For example, there's no dedicated ""jump"" button, but making your fish swim upwards can cause them to make a little leap out of the water if they have enough speed built up. You know, that kind of thing. At first, it's super charming, as you roll fishbowls around and jump between puddles of water. In fact, the presentation on the whole of the game is pretty noteworthy, before we lose that thread. There's some serious saving grace in the execution of the game which is deceptively humorous, laden with dark comedy. Though the fish are cute in a sort of by-committee way, the dialogue and wit of the game is surprisingly sharp. From causing one select Englishman to have the absolute worst day of his life incidentally by completing levels to the hospital you escape from as piranha by flooding it with open blood packs (yes, that does actually happen), the funniest moments in the game are easily the darkest ones. Combined with an almost Pixar-like world the characters occupy, and it's easy to get onboard with the game's project aesthetically.You want to know what's harder to get onboard with, though? The game's sheer, steep difficulty, which seems to be tuned almost perfectly to ""just frustrating enough to not rage quit."" See, the problem with a physics platformer is that physics, in video games, sometimes do very weird things, and small, subtle differences between runs can completely make-or-break your chances of actually reaching the next checkpoint. If the levels were shorter or checkpoints were closer together, this might be less irritating, but as the game goes on, playing can begin to feel like a chore. Compounding this is the fact that levels don't retain progress between play sessions, so the only option left is to drag yourself through levels for long stretches, long after the charm of the presentation gives way to teeth-grinding difficulty. That said, not all the fish fare the same in terms of difficulty. the puffer-fish levels are, in general, enjoyable and feel reliable in their design. Holistically, though, the result of the game's pacing is an experience that is exponentially draining on a level-by-level basis. And for the sake of brevity, we won't even get into the game's ill-considered stealth sequences (which make the cumbersome controls feel worse, somehow) or how periodic use of randomness actually harms level design. (Screw the airport level. It's legitimately awful.)The most frustrating part of all of this, though, is that the game's charm is still there. There's some part of me, driven on by either sunk-cost fallacy or just a sheer bloody-minded determination, that wants to keep playing, long after the fun-factor has gone drier than a jar of sand left in the desert. When I Am Fish works, it's magnificent - a truly delightful experience that invokes many of the same emotions as watching an animated family film. But that wonder isn't enough to drag you through some deeply, deeply infuriating levels that feel deliberately unfair. Look, if you're a patient sort and like extremely difficult platformers, you could sure do worse. The comparisons to Monkey Ball are reasonably apt, honestly. But unless you're feeling particularly gluttonous for punishment, consider a less punitive platformer for your time.";6 August, 2022;
I Am Fish;obsidian_whiskers;NOT INFORMED;31 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 5.6 hrs on record;Don’t get fooled by the cute looks and the fun-invoking gameplay/trailer videos, no no no, I Am Fish in its core is a bone hard challenging 3D physics platformer in the tradition of old Marble Madness titles. And if you’re into this stuff, like, you don’t mind repeating sequences a lot or cursing yourself (or the game) in between, then definitely take a look at that one. But for casual to normal gamers, hmm, I don’t know, under these circumstances I’d only give a neutral to slightly positive recommendation. Don’t get me wrong, the graphics indeed are lovely, a lot of love for detail was unmistakably put into them, the scenarios are diverse, environments are highly original. But where it falls flat just is the fun factor in my opinion. Some levels are great and entertaining at some points, but others are hell due to some bad checkpoints here and there, and also some bad mechanics (yes flying fish, I’m looking at you, because of the awkward and unintuitive flying and jumping). Especially if you take into account that on your way you have to pick up some often hard to reach collectables (bread), and even if you get those in a try but just die afterwards, you always have to collect them again, starting from the last bad checkpoint (would have been better if you keep those once collected). That said, the devs are making it clear that they wanted their game to be a challenge, so I respect that. And to be fair, they even integrated a ‘skip to next checkpoint’ function to alleviate the grievances, which is nice for collecting stuff afterwards, but also fun-breaking anyway for any real gamer (after all I’m missing some gameplay through that if I skip them in new levels). Aw, like I said, I’m definitely torn inside. I really want to like the game, but at the moment I’m kind of undecided if I really want to continue (meanwhile I finished 7 of the 14 levels). And the fact that I obviously need 40 stars for the bonus level (you get 1 to 5 stars depending on your time and how often you died), while the flying fish levels for me always just end with 1 star, err, it kind of breaks my motivation at the moment. If someone would have asked me as a beta tester, I definitely would have advised to cut some of those long and difficult levels in half, thus doubling the levels, and also make a lesser difficulty with higher star count. And to make the flying easier. So much lost potential in my opinion, which is tragic. But like I said, it’s the devs’ decision, so I honor this nonetheless. And who knows, maybe I’ll get back to it now and then, for a level here and there, just for sport, but I honestly can’t say. There are too many games in the market to compete against I guess. Summing up, only get this one if you know what’s expecting you. And like always, maybe wait for a sale if you’re not sure (as for myself, I actually had it on my wishlist, but then luckily got it through Humble Choice, so in my case I’m not complaining too much in this regard).;28 August, 2022;

Not recommended -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am Fish is a surprisingly fun and adorable Jump-&-Run game with merely a handful of small issues.The controls feel great. The weight of the glassbowl / vehicles you control translates very well into the controls of the game and do not seem inappropriate whatsoever. Frequent changes in scenery and demands to the player, such as obstacles or different types of fish bowls, keep the gameplay surprisingly fresh throughout the game. This also includes the different types of fish and their abilities, making them all feel unique.The level design is great. Point. There is not much you can say here, other than the fact that this game looks surprisingly gorgeous for such a small indie game. There are so many things going on, there is always something happening in each level that makes you go ""Ooohh"" or ""Aaaah"", constantly topping the previous level's highlight with more absurdity and insanity, which is just great fun.The overall style is fantastic and rich with many details, such as the overall design of the environment with crammed attics, fantastic water physics, bustling plazas and even your little bit of world-building via trash in the water as a hindrance to show that the world is actually inhabited by humans, etc. In order to progress, you need to use a healthy amount of reason to interact with the world around you, making it feel quite alive. The fishes themselves are absolutely adorable and lovely in their design as well. A worldmap as level-navigator also gives the game a sense of scale which is not needed, but certainly adds to it.While also not something expected or needed, the little bit of story the game has, including its few cutscenes, add so much charme to the game. You start to feel for your piscine friends on their quest to find each other. This is especially the case for when you smash your fish-bowl and have to watch your fish die - you genuinely feel bad for it (unless you make use of the quick-reload-function).The sound is great, establishes a solid level of atmosphere and even causes some slight chuckles depending on the context, such as the blowfish's basketball sounds when rolling down a hill. The music, whilst feeling a little generic, does its job and constantly adapts to the level design, changing up in pace and keeps the events on screen fresh and entertaining. Personally, I would have preferred a bit of a calmer soundtrack, but that is just my personal view.So far I have only encountered two minor issues: 1) some visual bugs such as weird shadows, wonky reflections and a handful of short frame freezes / stuttering (although none of them were really annoying and did not interrupt the flow of the game all too much) and 2) some system seem like they needed a little bit of a better explanation (or an explanation at all), such as a certain stealth-sequence where the indicator for the ""enemies'"" level of awareness being easy to misunderstand. Though it does not hurt the flow of the game whatsoever, either, as it's just a little confusing.In short: If you want a cute, fun game reminiscent of somewhat retro-y jump & runs in terms of level design and overall feel, I can highly recommend this game. Replayability is also guaranteed, as the game often features multiple paths to take to reach the end of the level.";18 September, 2021;
I Am Fish;Fredward;NOT INFORMED;32 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 4.8 hrs on record;This game...It's a sweet idea. You have cute fish trying to find each other again with each a fitting ability specific to them. The graphics are undeniably great. Same for the artstyle. The soundstrack is... ok I guess.Let's just say it has it's charm, as long as you are in the open water.However, the controls are absolute ???? as soon as you're in a tank or have to be on land. I know that that's the point, but god they are so *awful*. The bowl permanently feels like a ice level in a platformer, in the bucket every little bump in the terrain is a pain to pass.Those weren't even the worst. You also have the jar, which is near impossible to go forward in, let alone turn it in the right direction to begin with.The abilities are generally pretty easy to use. I have to be fair, they are generally pretty good. There is one exception: the flying fish. It's near impossible to navigate that ??????? fish if you aren't already next to perfectly aimed to begin with.This game is hard. I'm not the biggest fan of these kind of games, but I can see why someone would like it. I'm not one of those. This game might be fun if you like these kind of challenges.;27 December, 2021;
I Am Fish;Kunovega;928 products in account;25 people found this review helpful; Recommended 19.9 hrs on record;"As a physics puzzle game the most difficult part is learning the controls. You'll be ""piloting"" various containers that your fish get stuck in from sealed fish bowls to mop buckets, glass jars and more and each shape has its own movement dynamics. The puzzles and mazes aren't typically hard to solve but can be hard to navigate until you adapt to the shape and momentum needed to move you in the right directions.With a forgiving respawn system and simple interface this falls very much into the casual, sit back and relax side of gaming.The story is a silly excuse to find reasons for a fish to get stuck in a variety of containers and takes some obvious hints of inspiration from the movie Finding Nemo, but there's not much to it and it's not very deep. It's just a series of what may as well be random events that create obstacles to overcome.There's some clever moments in how the puzzles interconnect and failing a jump out of a sewer because you got stuck in a piece of trash feels suspiciously like a teaching moment against littering. but overall it's a cute game and there's a fair number of puzzles with a few different fish to work through.---Bottom line: If you ever wanted to be a fish, rolling around in a ball, across a roof top, on an adventure… now's your chance.---While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?";24 November, 2023;

I am a veteran of Iraq and I remember all too well the hardships it brought upon the civilians, especially in the beginning of the war. I remember being heartbroken at the sight of children crying and begging for food on the side of the road.This ""game"" puts you square in the middle of the experiences of those civilians. It is a brutal, kill or be killed world - where an act of unimaginable violence may let you live another day, but it can also break your heart and soul. Some days, you are offered a chance at compassion - and if you take that chance, risking your own safety and resources for others, you may find you feel a bit better about yourself.Then there are the times where you are stuck between a rock and a hard place. You are unarmed, scavenging for anything to save your friends, and you peep through a keyhole and see a soldier brutally beating - and possible worse - a woman. He has an AK-47, you have a lockpick and a rumbling stomach. So you sit there and watch - afraid that any noise may turn his violent attention upon you. When it is all done, you hide until he leaves and then, shamefully, pick over the bloodied body of the woman for anything she may have scavenged before the soldier got to her.This is ""This War of Mine"" - a dark, beautiful, haunting, exhilerating, and horrible tale.What's that tagline, ""The first casualty of war is innocence""? It applies here - in a way you would have never imagined coming from a computer game.";20 November, 2014;
This War of Mine;unicornsteak;NOT INFORMED;2,511 people found this review helpful89 people found this review funny; Recommended 9.7 hrs on record;"This is an INCREDIBLE game. It was recommended to me by a close friend because, me being a former war refugee from the Balkans, he thought I might find the content ""a bit familiar."" It went a bit further than that, in fact it kind turned out to be some uncanny early-childhood simulator for me. I still remember the visceral terror of being a child in that war. I will never forget howling and begging my mother not to go outside to buy bread, out of fear that she would be shot dead by a sniper. Asking why my grandmother couldn't go instead.This game captures moments like that with a masterful hand. It is never heavy or hamfisted. I can't explain how well the developers have encapsulated the hoplessness and the mundane brutality of the Balkan civil war, and it leads me to think that at least one key person involved in the development of this game had to have lived through it, too. The tone is just perfect, striking that difficult balance between terror and absurdity, and reminds me of all the films I love that came out of Former Yugoslavia after the war. This is not Angelina Jolie painting Balkan politics with a broad brush dipped in ignorance and a skewed western perspective insensitive of nuance--this is an authentic work of art that is sensitive to the complexities of its subject matter and the individual stories of the thousands of people whose lives were shaped and altered forever by this horrible, unnecessary war. It's an emotional playthrough, even for people who haven't had any experience with the historical event. It is a ""war game"" like no other and I can't recommend it enough. Take it from someone who was there.";27 October, 2015;

This War of Mine;Dorander;307 products in account;887 people found this review helpful27 people found this review funny; Recommended 36.0 hrs on record;10 hours in review: I hate this game.I am a completionist. I mostly play RPGs and strategy games. I like to win, so my gaming style primarily involves achieving goals, expanding my powerbase, meeting my targets, improving my strength, all of which to end in a smashing victory.This War of Mine offers very little and frequently none of these things. The gameplay is inherently simple. You have a few survivors in a badly damaged house. During the day they can do simple tasks, like building furniture, patching a hole in the wall or something else to help you survive, cooking meals, distilling hooch, or resting from nightly activities. During the night one person can go out to scavenge for badly needed supplies, while the rest sleeps (hopefully in a bed) or stands guard, hoping you won't get raided during the night.Rather than adding and expanding, the game constantly offers straightforward but difficult choices. Does the scavenger bring home raw materials today so somebody can patch a hole in the wall, or does he bring medication in case somebody gets sick or wounded? Do I risk life and limb to steal from armed bandits or inflict myself with moral guilt stealing from the defenseless elderly? Do I give my last piece of food to the wounded guy who has to stand guard tonight or to the sick man on the bed? Do I trade away my last bandages while nobody's wounded so we can all eat tomorrow? There's no do-overs either so I am stuck with my choices. Beyond just restarting the entire story of course.This is what makes This War of Mine so damn good.Every day in the game, it's one bad choice or another, all for the sake of staving off immediate disaster. For one more day. For the sake of survival. For the hope that things will be a little bit better tomorrow, if only you can get through the problems right now. Can you survive without resorting to theft? If you can't, who do you steal from, how much do you risk in the process? What about murder, when does that get justified by survival?If as a player you do not get upset by stealing or murdering for the sake of your group of survivors, then your survivors will. They get sad and depressed, even suicidal, from committing atrocities. Morale is an important part of the game, and the horrorific actions you commit to in the name of surviving are as relevant as the ones that are inflicted upon you. Maybe even moreso.Because war is horrible and this glimpse of what living in a warzone is like, just so. It is atrocious. It is insecure. It comes with the realization that while this game has plenty abstractions, these stories are real. There are people who have lived through this. Who are trying to live through it in the world today. Who probably will be trying to live through it in the future.Who only want to survive. Just one more day. Maybe tomorrow will be better.I have to stop writing now. Marko is sick, but he's the only one who is uninjured after last night when bandits tried to raid our shelter again. We have some rat meat left over so I'd best cook him a meal. Maybe he'll finally find some medicine tonight. Hopefully the trader will come by today, we have a few bottles of moonshine ready. If not, I might drink it. All of it. Who am I kidding. Tomorrow won't be better. Things will only get worse.;15 October, 2017;

Things were going quite well for my four survivors. It was around Day 27. They had just fixed a broken guitar and a little bit before the nightfall Katia was playing the guitar and Kalina was listening to her play and sang(?). I thought it was heartwarming.Then it was time to send Katia to scavenge. I chose St. Mary's Church and wasn't too worried, because I thought it would be relatively safe. There wasn't much to find though and then I saw a man and made Katia sneak a little bit closer, so that I could hear what the man was mumbling. I hid Katia and waited. I figured the man wasn't interesting and thought it would be better to leave, and just when Katia stepped out of her hiding spot the man found what he had been looking for, turned around and spotted Katia.He had a gun. Katia didn't have any weapons. I think he shot Katia or then I just decided it was best to flee, as he approached Katia threateningly, and after that he started shooting. I wish I had guided Katia to a different route, but I didn't. She started to climb the ladders and was shot to death. I was shocked.In the morning, seeing my other survivors sad, especially little Kalina, was heartbreaking. Everything had seemed to go well and now it was just a distant memory. I had lost my bargainer and it was harder to play with only two adults. I knew I had made mistakes and I cursed my timing, maybe Katia would have survived if I had waited longer, maybe I could have hidden her somewhere if I had guided her to a different route. Pavle or Bruno said something like ""she was just here and now she isn't"" and that's exactly how I felt. It was sad and it gives me shivers.I didn't dare to return to St. Mary's Church, but I want to explore it when I start a new game. The other three survived.";16 February, 2022;

Most survival games I've played are either pretty forgiving, or shallow in character.This one is neither. In the beginning of my hours I was hopeful and treated others I met with the same kidness I normally would, as the going was good. I shared my supplies, and took in others that needed shelter. Food was used daily and luxuries were built.36 days later (and still going) the survivors that are left are battered men. hungry, sick and tired. We've had to kill to survive, even innocent people, because the only other option was our own death. We have stolen and traded our way through the cold-snap, and the outlook is grim.All that matters now is lasting the few days until outside aid arrives. But in the end, will that really matter? We're not the same people we started as, and the atrocities we've commited are ones we have to live with forever.I highly reccomend this game, but be warned: Your decisions WILL have severe consequences, you WILL hate yourself for the evils you have done, necissary as they may feel. You will learn to know the survivors, what things they find acceptable, who can talk to whom best. Most of all you will think ""Maybe next run, I can do things differently.."". I know I am at this point, as it looks like my first run will end in failure and misery.10/10, am now broken, tired and hungry IRL. Soundtrack matches the atmosphere, graphics are a little jarring at first but become normal after a little bit. Gameplay is solid and needs very little introduction, and you will want to think your decisions through a few times... It all matters in the end.";14 November, 2014;

Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft;Nubby;the Red Nosed Noobcake;188 people found this review helpful; Recommended 21.4 hrs on record;So far, the game is excellent, and overwhelmingly untouched in terms of any censorship. I'd recommend it to anyone who wishes to play the classic trilogy. HOWEVER, please keep the following three things that greatly need attention in mind:1. The camera angles sometimes in the Remastered graphics mode go absolutely ???????. I mean totally whacked out, to the point where you're forced to switch over to Classic graphics by hitting the start button. That really needs fixed.2. Some items, when you're in the remastered mode, become very difficult to see. Yes, the remastered modes' lighting looks pretty, but it's fairly obvious, when switching between the modes, that the lighting style of the classic game was often built around highlighting objects.3. The Modern controls, while very beneficial 95% of the time, occasionally cripple the player. I spent 20 damn minutes on a jump in St. Francis' Folly, smacking against the pillar like a jackass, until I had looked up a video of someone doing it seamlessly, and switched back to Tank Controls. After switching over, I achieved the jump on my second try. Again, 95% of the time it's a good improvement, but that only makes the crippling 5% of the time more frustrating, if you don't know why it's happening.All in all, I've really enjoyed this release. The Remastered graphics are well done, but more importantly, they always feel like they were trying to bring them to a higher resolution, rather than leave their own mark on the game. So many times with texture packs in modded projects, you get the feeling that the author of the pack plain didn't like some original choices, and decided to simply change it with no understanding of how it would gel with the rest of the environment. not here. Yes, that leads to some animals looking rather derpy in the face, but I'd have that any day over some passionless generic asset being put in place of the original models.Just a little more time in the oven, and this will be a wonderful product. But, even despite the current issues, it's a great excuse to go back to one of the landmark titles in Action Adventure games.; 17 February;

We found that this one was on the cheaper side and rated very well, so decided to give it a try. We both loved it.The story was outstanding. There were no jump-scares per say, but the atmosphere was definitely creepy and at some points I was a little freaked out, which I loved. The puzzles were absolutely 10/10 amazing for co-op, nothing ever got frustrating, and it just worked really well the way it's all laid out and designed. Absolutely worth the money and we WILL be playing it again with me in the other role/with the other insect, possibly doing it 2x more for all achievements. Absolutely outstanding and we both hope to see more co-op puzzle games like this from this developer.If you want a sort of comparison, it's a TINY bit like a simplified version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, but without a time limit/inherent danger. There is one timed puzzle but it's not that difficult and if you fail, you just start over. As far as we could tell, nothing can stop your progression permanently.

Cosmoteer: Starship Architect & Commander;Semaphia;NOT INFORMED;140 people found this review helpful; Recommended 14.1 hrs on record;A bright start, but there's a long way to go!The ship building is the highlight so far, though playing the standard game mode & harvesting regularly, you will be upgrading/rebuilding your ship a bit too frequently. There's a decent amount of materials available to ship builders, & plenty more available through the workshop. It's all about finding the right balance of offensive & defensive capabilities, weight/size vs mobility, and micromanaging crew for efficiency - mostly by creating ship layouts that make sense, but also with unique orders. Combat is enjoyable, though you'll find yourself very overleveled & developed earlier on playing on the standard mode (if you're building regularly), so it's best to keep that in mind if you're looking for a challenge.Current quests include mostly combat (destroy a target/liberate a base), exploration, & delivery. You'll travel between systems looking for more challenging content, though the value of the rewards dries up pretty quick if you take your time to harvest materials & rebuild your ship. The quest content overall is... Passable, at best. Nothing feels particularly memorable, & it doesn't feel like there's enough going on in regards to personnel to make for a Rimworld-like experience, either.The community is fantastic & helpful/welcoming towards newcomers. The Steam Workshop integration is already offering up a plethora of mods from simple of quality of life tweaks all the way to custom ship parts & unique ship designs, though as always, I'd suggest playing for a while without before jumping in.As it stands, it's a stunning ship building experience marred by a lack of meaningful questing/gameplay experiences, but what Cosmoteer lacks in content currently is more than made up for by the promise of things to come. Even if the developers were to fail on delivering their vision, the game has built up enough of a fandom that the included workshop support will allow for a bright future regardless. It's a bright start, & a solid recommendation for creative sorts, but if you're looking for a more fleshed out gaming experience, it might be worth holding back for a bit.;16 November, 2022;

Cosmoteer: Starship Architect & Commander;Drizzle;366 products in account;157 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 15.0 hrs on record;In my opinion, this game is the perfect example of Early Access. Is the game perfect? No. It shouldn't be, it's in EA. But is it a broken, buggy mess? Also no. It shouldn't be released if it is. Sure, there are some bugs and missing QoL features, but that is to be expected in an EA game. The developer has been very communicative, releasing several updates to address bugs and crashes, and overall did a great job at releasing the game in a state befitting to the game.As far as the actual gameplay, I think this game is a LOT of fun. I love the crew management aspect and I find the logistics to be intuitive. One of my favorite features of the game is when you intend to repair/make modifications to your ship, and you don't have the materials around you, the game automatically attempts to utilize materials that are from destroyed ships or purchase it from nearby stations if possible. Same with upgrades. I have found the gameplay to be a little shallow since there is not much to do besides make your ship bigger and go against more difficult enemies. But even with what exists, there is a lot of time you can spend before you'd see every system in career mode. I cannot speak to stability in multiplayer since I have not tried it. It seems there are some desync issues that the developer is tracking down, but I am confident that these will get sorted. Finally, a few suggestions that I'm sure are already on the developer's list: Create ships from scratch without having to find an abandoned ship. I believe this has already been mentioned by the developer as coming in the near future. Right now, you can only create additional ships for your fleet by transferring crew to an abandoned ship. This means if you're insanely rich and you want to build support ships, you have to commandeer one that you've destroyed. And you have to be careful not to overdo the destruction or you won't be able to take control and you'll have to just salvage it. Better fleet management. I feel like it would be nice to have some more intuitive fleet management. One thing I have taken to doing is creating ships with particular roles in mind. For instance, I made an industry ship that can extract and process ores into more advanced products you will need later. But if I leave it on its own (since it does have rudimentary defenses), it is quite the hassle to have to jump back and forth. Unless I don't see it, having a fleet summary screen somewhere would be really helpful. Maybe also some sort of automation to non-controlled ships? Like if I could command an industry ship to extract nearby minerals from an asteroid field, that would grant me more flexibility to focus on commanding my combat ships. Construction of hyper beacons/stations. I think it would be a great late game project to create your own stations that have platforms. I apologize if this is already a feature and I haven't gotten there yet. It would be cool to see player-created stations that can defend themselves from pirates like the existing stations. And also to have a facilitated trade network that can help create passive wealth in the late game stage. This is not a super important feature, but maybe a good one to have down the road.Overall, I think this game is well worth the $20 and has some of the best shipbuilding gameplay I have come across. It is easy to pick up, and has a very nice learning curve that doesn't jump difficulty too fast (but still has a challenge for the player).;29 October, 2022;

For me it’s just like Left 4 Dead but instead you get to take revenge on the entire spider population of Australia.Just a heads up: The second you download Deep Rock Galactic you become a big manly 37 year old dwarf with a big bushy beard.It’s the saga of 4 space Dwarves that constantly scream ""Rock and Stone!"", and how they drain a planet of its resources. It's a FPS, but you are a badass Dwarf from space and you fight big ass-spiders and you drink beer and mine for ore that you can trade for money and so you can get cooler guns. Did I mention there is beer? Yup, there’s also an ingame bar you can get sh*t faced in.So… you got an irrational fear and hate of bugs?

Boxes will randomly spawn sometimes with some stuff from old events so you will never lose out on some fashion You go alone or with friends into the surface, and complete various missions as enemies try to kill you.

Deep Rock Galactic - Original Soundtrack Volume I + II;GeT_HarD;195 products in account;24 people found this review helpful; Recommended 1,029.2 hrs on record;Deep Rock Galactic is one of those rare games that continues to receive loving updates from its developers. To this day, new content is regularly released, including new weapon overclocks, mission types, enemy types, cosmetics, and more. Most cosmetics can be earned through SEASONS, which are completely FREE. It’s a solid co-op shooter that offers four different playable classes: Scout, Driller, Gunner, and Engineer.For the best gameplay experience, it's recommended to form a team with all four classes (the game is best balanced for four players but is still fun with fewer). Each class complements the others with its unique utilities. Here’s a brief overview of each class:Gunner: The least mobile class, but provides the highest sustain damage. The Gunner’s strong suit is the shield, which can be deployed at a chosen location to protect anyone inside from enemy damage.Driller: Offers high mobility for the entire team by drilling through the cave walls to access hard-to-reach areas. Most of Driller’s weapons deal steady damage with fire, acid, or frost, making him effective against smaller enemies and conserving ammo.Scout: The most mobile class, able to quickly grapple to cave walls, making it easy to reach difficult spots. The Scout is typically the main miner of valuable resources that are hard for other classes to access. Provides utility with a flare gun that lights up the cave. The Scout’s weapons focus on single-target damage to weak spots.Engineer: Has weaker primary weapons but incredibly strong secondary ones designed for high burst damage. The Engineer provides utility with deployable platforms, great for helping Scouts reach high places and reducing fall damage. Additionally, the Engineer can set up sentry turrets.A major advantage of the game is the extremely friendly player base, with the lowest number of toxic players compared to other multiplayer games. This low toxicity is partly because it’s a PvE game, where players are more focused on fun than competition.Replayability is high, with endless goals like collecting all the cosmetic items (none of which are pay-to-win). The only purchasable content is available on the Steam store as DLCs, offering visual upgrades for weapons and armor sets. However, the game provides plenty of these upgrades through regular gameplay without needing to buy DLCs. As a regular supporter, I own all available DLCs, but I still use many in-game-earned armor sets and weapon upgrades.Managing ammo effectively is crucial, as you don’t have unlimited supplies. Another key aspect is maintaining good situational awareness, avoiding being surrounded, and always having an escape route.I highly recommend the game. If you don’t have friends to play with, don’t worry. You can join other players, and most communication happens through pings, so there’s no need to worry about social anxiety. The developers respect your time and money, avoiding predatory practices common in many modern games.Rock and Stone!; 10 June;

Session: Skate Sim;A;NOT INFORMED;211 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 238.2 hrs on record;This game is not finished.Now it's important to establish that I do not—and by extension, nobody but the team behind this game really do—know why they decided it was a good idea to sell this game as a finished product. My guess is to make the game available on more platforms, for more people, and being able to play this game on PlayStation is undoubtedly awesome. it's great that more players get to have their hands on the single most definitive skateboarding simulator out there right now, but this game did not deserve to leave Early Access.It's buggy, and it's broken. It's lacking features and optimisations critical to the full skateboarding experience. The game feels completely empty. Character customisation is laughably underdeveloped. You can't even skate goofy-footed without noticeably janky animations. sucks to be that other half of the skateboarding population, I guess. Features touted as part of the game are still listed under experimental menus, a signal that these things are subject to change, or subject to be abandoned completely.This was never a problem, of course, and anybody else whom sunk the hundreds of hours that I did into this game, across both Steam and Xbox no less, understands that the pleasure you get out of playing Session is the same joy you get out of real-life skateboarding: being part of a culture, expressing yourself, bettering yourself. I want to make it clear that this core aspect of the game hasn't changed whatsoever, in fact it has only improved, and undoubtedly will continue to improve...But now that the game has released, the bar is raised. Early Access was a completely acceptable excuse for buggy, broken experimental features, outdated animations, a soulless city and a glitchy story mode that feels more like a proof of concept than a campaign, among a longer list of bugs and issues that the game has always suffered from. There is no longer any acceptable reason for the game to be in this state.The players expect more, and they are right to expect more. Veteran players like myself may continue to enjoy the game for the little skateboarding sandbox that it offers—I know that I definitely am never going to stop playing this game and following its development—but there is nothing in this game that was worth a 1.0 build number. Nothing in this game that is worth £34.99, that's for sure.;23 September, 2022;

I'm going to start by saying. This game is not for casuals! This is not another version of EA's skate franchise! This is completely different, only thing identical is the sport it's based around!When I play Session I find myself forgetting that it is made by an indie studio. It was great out of the gate for me, this lived up to and exceeded all my expectations. But there are a few things I will comment on below that may not suite everyone.I'm going to start with the CONTROLS 8.5/10:Pros:-The controls overall feel good and I think they become intuitive after a while.-Very precise and make sense to anyone with knowledge of real skating.-In depth skate guide in the settings.Cons:-The controls are hard to learn at first.-People who don't have skating knowledge may struggle to know how a trick is performed.-Skate guide can be confusing at times.Graphics 9/10:The graphics look amazing except for the character, some work could (and most likely will) be done there.But with the great graphics comes the issue of performance. Their recommended specs are perfect, I have the recommended and can run the game in max settings as 1080p and maintain a constant 60fps. But if your system is old now or is just a bit slow, you may struggle to run the game on high settings.Story TBD:In the current state there is no story in the game.However if you require an objective to make it interesting, they have implemented daily and weekly challenges.Map Design 9.5/10:The map design is AMAZING. There are a few bugs around the map however, but I'm sure any major ones will be removed.As a skating environment, it is perfect. Every inch of the map is skate-able in one form or another. I have absolutely no complaints about the map, couldn't have asked for more, it's perfect.Fun 10/10:This is game is most fun I've had in a long time. From the trick lines I aim for to all the stupid bugs that occur, it's all amazingly fun. This is most definitely the BEST skateboarding game to have been released to this date. Thank you to the Crea-Ture studio team for creating such a masterpiece of a game. I cannot wait to see where they take the game from here. Would I Recommend It?Yes 100%, if you want a fun game and you understand skateboarding then this game is 100% for you.If you don't skate it will definitely be harder to learn but I think you could do it within an hour or two and I imagine it would still be super fun.If you have any questions leave it below and I will be sure to reply!;22 September, 2019;

Not very fast, albeit it felt steady and communication from devs regarding future plans been relatively clear and the vibe was ""anti AAA industry"" with their focus on sales rather than quality gameplay (seriously just look at crea-ture studios' ""about us"" section on their website).At one point, the project was bought by Nacon, members of the core dev team left and the game was rushed to an official 1.0 release - and this is where this bad review stems from:Ever since, paid DLC been pumping out with next to 0 improvements to the core gameplay, which in all honesty still feels very early access. In a similar fashion, most of the long standing bugs are being ignored, features that where promised years ago appear completely off the table..I was supportive and bought the first few DLC, but nowadays they can kiss my behind.. Fix the game, then sell more stuff.If you do, i'll make sure to give the game the thumbs up the core gameplay (if fixed) really deserves."; 24 January;

shapez;Prorogue;NOT INFORMED;110 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 102.8 hrs on record;This game is basically an alternate version of Factorio, so I'll just focus on the differences.Shapez.io is like Factorio but without the following:- Every placeable object is completely free to construct- (you have no inventory since every building is free)- Every 'ore' patch is infinite- There are no obstacles or enemies or terrainOn the face of it, you might say 'well that sounds strictly easier than Factorio,' but: In this game there is no single 'assembler' building but rather multiple smaller buildings that do discrete assembly tasks, and going from raw resource to finished product can involve up to dozens of these tasks. It's like if someone 'opened up' the assembly buildings in Factorio and let you design your own. Also, there are hundreds of permutations of shapes instead of the dozens of craftable items in Factorio. You might say 'okay, we'll think of the circle shape as Iron,' but then - what is specifically the lower-left quadrant of the circle supposed to be? What if it's green? What if it's stacked on top of something else?Basically, Shapez.io removes resource management and environmental challenge completely, and adds extra complexity in assembly and item variety. In the end I think the two are equally challenging, although I would suggest Factorio for players new to the factory-sim genre.;12 September, 2021;

shapez;cdarklock;NOT INFORMED;83 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 6.7 hrs on record;"Received this as a gift after wishlisting it. I guess that qualifies as free? I didn't get it from the developer. This is basically Factorio without the survival and story aspect. Each ""resource"" is composed of four quadrants, which can be split and coloured and combined into literal trillions of combinations. Delivering these combined shapes to your ""hub"" earns you various upgrades to your tools, so you can deliver more shapes faster. There's no justification for this. you just do it to be doing it, so you can do more of it. The resources don't have any meaningful qualities other than shape and colour, and the things you make out of them have no apparent use or purpose. They're just the things you make, because you make them. Whether you regard this as some sort of pure Platonic ideal or a dystopian Kafkaesque nightmare is up to you, and the game won't push you in either direction. All the puzzles/strategy revolve around one fundamental process: split your resources into the components of what you're making, assemble whatever components need to be the same colour, colour those components, then assemble the coloured components into the final result and deliver it to the hub. This eventually reaches a critical mass of complexity where you have two layers of four dissimilar quadrants in four different mixed colours, and you're done. The puzzles can never get harder than that. Beyond this point, the only thing the game can do to provide ""challenge"" is to demand higher production volumes. Ultimately, the abstraction removes replayability. Comparison to Factorio is, of course, inevitable - while you might also compare Satisfactory or Infinifactory, Factorio is the gold standard of factory simulations. In any given game of Factorio, you have a number of goals you can pursue: you can build the rocket, you can make a fortress against the biters, you can go out hunting biters, you can build extensive railway lines, and all of these have their own particular brand of satisfaction. But in shapez.io you don't get any of that: just an abstract idea of production and delivery. You don't even get the benefit of choosing your path - you unlock all the same upgrades in the exact same order for the exact same production targets. There's no surprise or challenge inherent in starting a new game. You don't need to prioritise your research or choose the best starting location. You start here. Your resources are there. Your goal is this. Your reward is that. Every game starts the same. There's no point in going back to the beginning. Eventually, you'll converge on the most efficient multipurpose factory you can make, and as your production targets increase, you'll just duplicate it farther out. This will go on until you have every belt running into your hub filled to capacity. Assuming you don't get bored af and quit playing before that. For the price, however, it's good value. Plus it runs well on old hardware. And if you enjoy the puzzly parts of Factorio without enjoying the combat and survival thing so much, like I do, it might be exactly the kind of thing you've always wanted. But mostly it makes me want to play Factorio again.";9 November, 2020;

It is not ""Factorio, but different"", it is not ""its own unique spin on Factorio"". It's a feature stripped from Factorio and sold as its own game. It is what VR Missions is to Metal Gear Solid. It is that custom level where you stand still shooting bots in Counter-Strike. It is what the starting menu warm-up mode is to FIFA.If you're not familiar with Factorio, go play Factorio.If you are familiar with Factorio, shapez.io is not all bad. I give it a thumbs up after all. But be wary of these reviews, they are spinning the game in a very positive light. It is not just Factorio without the context, the resource management, the pollution, the danger, the difficulty, the player character. It is all those things, but that's not all. In Factorio, each material represents a resource. They require specific manufacturing steps to build more complex compounds and devices, allowing you to process further in the tech tree and thus the game.In Shapez.io, there is the cutter, the stacker and the painter. That is all. Each is introduced in the 15-minute tutorial, and the rest of the game is cutting, stacking and painting. Any progress in the game is having more cutters, stackers and painters in conjunction.Some reviewers are saying ""there's endless complexity in the variations!"" as some sort of replacement for the content found in Factorio. It's true, there are many variations. Each ""block"" is just the titular shapes after all. When playing the game you are asked to build quarter circles combined with a green square combined with a yellow star. Undoubtedly the mathematical possibilities of different shapes are astronomical. There is no complexity to it, though. Manufacturing any shape happens in a combination of cutters, stackers and painters. You might rotate a block differently, or stack from left to right instead of right to left, but the procedure is the same each time. This gigantic number of possible variations is of course achieved by having the blocks be entirely meaningless. You're not using them to build anything like in Factorio, they are simply ""collected in your HUB"", so you can open up the pause menu to view how many you have collected. You do get some missions that don't seem to do anything after the tutorial, and a level up mechanic, which basically just speeds up the game. Not ""speed up"" via unlocking features or abilities. Literally speed up by sending a multiplier to the game engine to run faster.Because there is no context, no setting, no story, no character and no danger, there is also no incentive for the player. You could just leave the game running on its own, and you won't be any further along or in a more advantageous position if you spent the ten hours playing intensively. That might not matter to you, but it's worth mentioning.That lead me to the dreaded conclusion: this is a game for people who like to ""kill time"". I don't like to kill time. I do it out of my own stupidity or laziness, but I don't seek it out. To me it's like saying ""I like to burn money"" or ""I like to throw away food"". I gain no enjoyment from it.There is however something in this game that in my opinion pretty much justifies its existence: the Puzzle DLC. I should review it separately, but giving access to the Puzzle DLC is what makes this game worth getting. The Puzzle DLC is very self-explanatory, it's puzzles with limited resources, using the same mechanics familiar from Factorio. It truly is ""a unique spin on the Factorio formula."" So if you're buying this game, get it with the DLC. The base game might have some value in keeping your fingers occupied while listening to a podcast or something, but you could also just learn to knit. It's more engaging, more exciting, has more variety and you get socks or a nice hat out of it.";7 December, 2021;

The AI is exactly the same as the classic game and therefore gets very repetitive and boring2. The AI players will only mess around with you, they do not interact with one another (very much like the orginal) this leaves me frustrated and uninterested in pursuing another round.3. You will be bombarded with constant council missions, literally the worst aspect of the classic.4. No new features, same content as original game. You would have thought that they could have at least added a few new undesirables but nope.5. Missions ""coming soon""6. The audio when entering some of the buildings is far too loud, for example the bikers building. I appreciate using the orginal audio but they could have tweaked it a bit so it doesn't make your ears bleed.7. Multiplayer is dead, not really the developers fault but this could have been the games strongest point for a modern audience. 8. Pricing, £24.99 is far too steep. If it was priced lower there could have been the prospect of more players to play with but nope. I feel ripped off as this is simply a HD skin pack for the classic game. (which I already have several copies of!)Maybe buy it when its on sale for half the price. Even then be cautious as you could get the same experience and gameplay from the classic game for less.Don't think i'll bother buying another game from this developer, they really didn't do their research.";26 May, 2017;

Constructor;Holysword;NOT INFORMED;13 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Not Recommended 11.5 hrs on record;Constructor is a remake of the old acclaimed homonimous game from 97. This review assumes that you know the original game (see my review here).If we are being honest here, the game from 97 didn't age well and was truly begging for a remake. Probably not *this* one though.This remake failed to add any valor to the game but instead ripped of the originality and the style. New house types were added, but they feel kind of off. Some features were added (e.g. kitched lvl 3 allows auto-adding tenant after current ones die) but I'm not sure if that is welcome. Some new quests were added but they also feel off, specially the zombie one.Some voices were updated (e.g. repairman) some kept (e.g. foreman) culminating in a Frankenstein-like elegance. The music is obnoxious and most of the new art hurts the eyes: not because they are bad, they just don't match. Nothing matches anything. The interface looks confusing and hard to navigate sometimes. The bloody colourpalette was changed - why? The estates are much larger now and that changes the game style. You can disable enemies building in your estates, and the default 2-click building placement is atrocious. There are pros: the game is now rich in shortcuts which speedup several chores and playing in 1920p is also enjoyable (but doesn't work in 4k). Plus, achievements! (they can be done in one seat tho). I uninstalled this and went straight back to Constructor Classic right after. Stick to the original if you can tolerate the low res.PS: The game works perfectly with Steam Proton, btw.;26 March, 2020;

Steven Wilson's music here is mainly instrumental versions from his solo albums and it works effortlessly as a soundtrack. The story of the game is mainly stripped down to pure emotions and although simplistic, the raw emotions of the experience are more than enough to keep you intrigued.

That way, the emotional impact was maybe even bigger.There are few games that really touched me and got me all emotional, Last Day of June is definitely one of them.One thing that might be frustrating (depending on how you're playing) is, that there is no free saving.So if you quit the game without hitting an autosave point you might have to replay quite a portion of the game.Apart from that, i'd highly (!) recommended to anyone, who likes games with rather simplistic gameplay and a deeply amotional tale about love and loss.";26 November, 2017;
Last Day of June;CharlieLima79;NOT INFORMED;33 people found this review helpful; Recommended 3.9 hrs on record;Games like Last Day of June make me wish, once again, that Steam’s user game rating system is non-binary. LDJ has several good qualities, but also a couple of frustrating ones that pretty much cancel out its shining attributes.LDJ is a time-travelling tale about Carl and June, husband and wife who live in a charming little community. While the idea of going back in time to change the future is not new, it is a very appealing one. This is especially when the protagonists are trying to save the love of their lives. This premise is one that many people, especially after they have experienced loss of loved ones, can resonate with. The fact that LDJ also contains no spoken language allows it to transcend language barriers, so players of various backgrounds can enjoy its touching, and at times heart-wrenching, story.LDJ is also a treat visually. The characters look like simple wooden puppets that evoke feelings of innocence that contrast the game’s mature theme. the setting is that of an idyllic neighbourhood that makes you yearn for the halcyon days. the classic use of colours -- warm ones to highlight happiness and love, and muted ones to emphasize sadness and loneliness -- helps with conveying emotions and foreshadowing.However, while the game is pleasing thematically and aesthetically, it fails in execution. Its most egregious flaw is that cutscenes -- lingering shots, slow pans and all -- are unskippable, even though you have watched them previously. This means that you are forced to relive the key moments of the story -- especially the defining tragedy -- each time you go back in time to try to preventJune’s death.At first, reliving the tragic moment is poignant, strengthening Carl’s frustration and resolution. As you embark on more journeys to the past, succeeding or failing in your missions depending on how well you can effect change, it becomes borderline cruel that you have to watch the tragedy happen repeatedly. Even if you play the game with the aid of a walkthrough, you will likely to find rewatching the key moments wearisome, especially when you know what happened or will happen already.Another problem with LDJ is that locations of autosave points are not clear. Twice I thought my game saved, but did not. This forced me to replay certain segments, making the experience even more repetitive than it needed to be. LDJ also does not have cloud save at the time of this review, so if you need to resume playing on a different computer, you will need to have a copy of the saved game file handy.In spite of its weaknesses, LDJ delivers a powerful, beautiful and touching ending that just makes its flawed gameplay and execution more glaring and frustrating. Hence, while I do recommend LDJ, it is hard for me to do so enthusiastically. Is it worth enduring the repetitiveness and unrefined execution to experience the solid landing that the game’s story delivers? I believe so, but only if you have the time, patience or emotional resolve for it.;15 September, 2019;

Add Steven Wilson's music to great watercolour-like artwork and you'll have astonishing blend of natural beauty in storytelling. There's lot of talk around game being buggy. Saves are corrupted etc. Well it did not happen to me - played much later as well, so I can not comment on this.The story. It's quite simple and therein lies its greatness. Cute couple Carl and June are relaxing after picnic on their favourite pier and due to rising storm have to rush home. Then the gamepad starts vibrating - something happened. Death. One person has died and death wraps it’s veil around many people. Kurt Cobain’s “All in all is all we all are” came to mind and player is actually given control to use different gameworld characters to butterfly effect the moment that happened.So you can steer the story with 6 characters total, but you still know you are doing this for Carl. Carl is interesting...I don’t know many games having wheelchair protagonist in it. he carries the darkness and hopelessness in the narrative and through him we can play deus ex machina with what happened. Sadness and regret are therefore always granted in this colourful world albeit the other characters you play do not know what’s going to happen. I like that the developers packed pretty serious topics of death, loss, regret, emptiness etc to a nice portable package. It’s presented in-game as a gift as well, unavoidable and has to be accepted.The graphics, music and very very well done solution for voice acting all ease the creeping moments of “not again” and “I don’t want this to happen”.Game controls are easy, I played it with controller but looked like with keyboard and mouse it’s the same. There are some things that might annoy you - you can not skip cutscenes and due to repetitiveness of the moment you are trying to alter, well they happen again and happen and…. Also some scenes made me feel rushed and too much scripted. Game is short, I don't know if it's a bad thing or not, but I don't like to keep games running to get trading cards. Just a Steam thing, not games fault.Long story short - very well made game.Funny emotion that I had was “Carl really is a bad driver”.added: 29.12.2017;28 December, 2017;

After 15 days I thought that I didn't really do much so far to achieve my main goal and when the 21st day was over, I was game over. I did everything the game asked me to and was quite good at it, but the game didn't tell me what to do to actually succeed.Because I didn't pay attention. I expected the game to tell me what to do or at least give me very obvious hints in form of a task list or something. But in this game it doesn't work like that. You and you alone are responsible to tie the lose ends together to end the main plot in a positive way.And that's awesome and something very rare in the days of games where you just blindly run towards a marker on a minimap.;4 November, 2017;
Beat Cop;Elleissa;NOT INFORMED;235 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 9.7 hrs on record;So I really enjoyed this game at first, I loved the humor and the interesting gameplay. Story began well, but quickly died off. The reason I'm not recommending this game, however, is due to the massive amount of bugs I encountered that makes the game downright frustrating. I'm supposed to call a DEA agent to discuss a matter of stolen jewels, but the game refuses to let me use the payphone as instructed. I was supposed to tow a car from in front a building, in order to continue on with the story, but there were no cars in sight, causing me to get a game over. This happened to me three times in a row. Tried to catch a criminal, reported it to HQ, but the second part of the mission never triggered, causing yet another game over. I've had more than six game overs due to bug glitches. This game had so much potential and I wanted to love this game, but unfortunately it feels largely unfinished and far too buggy to truly enjoy.;5 August, 2017;
Beat Cop;of;NOT INFORMED;86 people found this review helpful; Recommended 7.7 hrs on record;Within Beat Cop, you play as a detective who, after taking down a thief at the Senator's mansion, is framed for the stealing of some diamonds from his safe. You're thrown down to Beat Cop status, and are tasked with patrolling a particularly seedy neighborhood. Your main job revolves around fining people for illegal parking or worn tires, but the story goes deeper than that with a street gang and the Italian mob both vying for power and control. Murders, robberies, and more go on as you do your basic patrol, and how you react to the mob, gang, and basic citizens affect their impression of you and how easily they escalate when confronted. You can get the mob in your pocket, but siding with the Mafia will put you on the gang's hit list.Beat Cop is a strong effort to create a compelling police-themed adventure. Patrolling your street and building relationships with various characters is engaging, and it certainly looks the part with nicely done pixel art visuals.With your attention so scattered among numerous calls to action, it can be confusing. Still, there is some fun to be found here if you don't sweat the details.THE GOOD- Feels like a cop drama- Dark and gritty story surrounded with adult humour- Very challenging as you progress- Great 80s TV show-likeTHE BAD- Some tasks aren't very clear as to what you need to do- A bit too strict on how much you have to earn in a short period7/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECEIf you like this review, then please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Beat Cop;CycoKillah;NOT INFORMED;61 people found this review helpful; Recommended 35.4 hrs on record;"In Beat Cop's trailer we see Kojak, Columbo, Magnum & Miami Vice... We're in the 80's!But none of that, nor Sledge Hammer himself, you are Jack Kelly, a NYPD detective who has been demoted to street police after a confusing robbery of a senator's house...You have 3 weeks to solve the case while you fulfill your role as a street cop.From where I start? For God's sake, what a 3 weeks! What a street!This game is a rare mixture, gameplay is very original. We are talking about an adventure with retro graphics where decisions matter, with a main story and daily secondary missions every day of the 3 weeks that at most will last the game (21 days) full of jokes, very funny! But it's also a time and resource management game. As if that weren't enough, there is also a reputation system with different factions and many different endings. All at rhythm of small (only 4 tracks) but exquisite soundtrack set in the 80's. An explosive cocktail! Believe me if I tell you that only street you walk day after day from 8 am to 5 pm in this game has life of its own. Unbelievable! Congratulations to the developers, you've did it great.I don't want to spoil anything, I will try to refer to some general aspects or funny things that are not relevant to the story.As a street cop you will have to fine vehicles (you can take bribes but beware! Someone might be watching) and stop vandalism, also there will be other specific daily tasks. Besides, there will be neighbors and shopkeepers on the block who will require your help through hilarious situations. And new ""friends"" who will be introduced to you on the first day: the Italian mafia and the Ni@ga crew.Somehow you'll have to try to get well with everyone which obviously won't be easy, all this while trying to solve the mystery of what happened that night in the senator's house.Come on, in that street you can do whatever you want literally (all with its consequences). You're a cop, of course there's free food, you'll need it to get from one end of street to the other in a blink if there's a problem. Well you can eat but you can also buy dope to block's dealer, if its of the good one its going to get you on top... or you can be a good cop and arrest dealer, but remember, next time you want to buy will be more expensive or maybe you do not get the good one )If you're in bad terms with the Italians or Ni@ga's Crew you could end up dead in an alley, but there's an alternative! Priest of Block's Church, who gives himself with amphetamine, can calm their spirits for a few hundred dollars.I would name another endless number of things to highlight that happen in this game but the best thing is that you buy it, discover it and enjoy it for yourselves.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpas7-jjCh0YuQBDyNzJDl2f-45YhNbd-En el trailer de Beat Cop vemos a Kojak, Colombo, Magnum & División Miami... Estamos en los 80!Pero nada de eso, ni del mismísimo Sledge Hammer, eres Jack Kelly, un detective de NYPD que a sido degradado a policía de calle luego de un confuso robo en la casa de un senador...Tienes 3 semanas para resolver el caso mientras cumples con tu rol de policía de calle.Por donde empezar? Por dios que 3 semanas!!! Que calle!!!Este juego es una mezcla rara, el gameplay es muy original. Estamos hablando de una aventura con gráficos retro donde las decisiones importan, con una historia principal y misiones secundarias diarias cada día de las 3 semanas que como máximo durará el juego (21 dias) plagada de chistes, muy graciosa! Pero también es un juego de gestión de tiempo y recursos. Por si fuera poco, además, hay un sistema de reputación con diferentes facciones y muchísimos finales diferentes. Todo al ritmo de la escasa (sólo 4 temas) pero exquisita banda de sonido ambientada en los 80. Un coctel explosivo! Créanme si les digo que esa única calle que recorren día tras día de 8 am a 5 pm en este juego tiene su vida propia. Increíble!Felicitaciones a los desarrolladores, se han pasado.No quiero adelantar nada, trataré de referirme a algunas cuestiones generales o cosas graciosas que no sean relevantes a la historia.Como policía de calle deberás efectuar multas a vehículos (puedes aceptar sobornos pero cuidado! alguien podría vigilar) y detener el vandalismo, también habrá otras tareas diarias especificas. A su vez, estarán los vecinos y comerciantes de la cuadra que requerirán tu ayuda a través de situaciones hilarantes. Y nuevos ""amigos"" que te serán presentados el primer día: la mafia italiana y los rateros negros.De alguna forma deberás tratar de estar bien con todos lo cual obviamente no será nada fácil, todo esto mientras tratas de resolver el misterio de lo que ocurrió aquella noche en la casa del senador.Vamos, en esa calle puedes hacer lo que quieras literalmente (todo con sus consecuencias). Eres policía, por supuesto que hay comida gratis, la necesitaras para poder ir de una punta a otra de la calle en un santiamén si surge algún problema. Bueno puedes comer pero también puedes comprarle falopa al dealer de la cuadra, si es de la buena te va a dejar a tope... o puedes ser buen policía y arrestar al dealer, pero recuerda, la próxima vez que quieras comprar será más cara o quizás no te den de la buena )Si estás en malos términos con los italianos o los negros podes terminar muerto en un callejón, pero hay un alternativa!, el cura de la cuadra, que se da con anfeta, les puede calmar los ánimos por unos cientos de dólares.Nombraría otra interminable cantidad de cosas a destacar que suceden en este juego pero lo mejor es que lo compren, lo descubran y disfruten por ustedes mismos.";4 November, 2019;
Beat Cop;NABEF9;NOT INFORMED;140 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 2.2 hrs on record;"I want to like this game, I really do, but there are too many things that are just frustrating. I'm on day 4, trying to be a good cop. I saw a car parked in front of a fire hydrant. I wrote it a ticket for the parking violation. I get a call instantly from Central saying that I can't go around writing bogus tickets. ""Oh, okay,"" I think, ""I guess parking in front of hydrants isn't a traffic infraction in this game.""But literally one minute later, a fire breaks out at 631. Central calls me to ask that I get the car blocking the hydrant towed. I run to 631, call a tow truck to move the car blocking the hydrant (so it IS a violation now?) and the tow truck pulls the car away with fifteen seconds to spare. I expect the timer to stop running, but it just keeps counting down to 0, then I get another call from Central asking why I didn't get the car towed. They told me that if the fire truck damages the parked car I'm responsible. The whole time I'm standing in front of 631 and it's totally clear out front. The fire truck pulls in with no issues. I also feel super limited by what options are given to me. I've been propositioned by a prostitute and all I can do is decline. why can't I arrest her for soliciting? There are drug dealers trying to sell me drugs as I walk past on my beat and all I can do is decline. why can't I arrest them for trafficking? When the Mafia gives me a tip about the Crew, why can't I request a warrant and investigate it rather than only being given the two options of investigating for the Mafia or declining to investigate altogether?A couple of times too I've had to reset days because the choices I made had the opposite effect that I intended. I got a tip that the Crew was going to be bringing in a hot shipment. I went to the pawn shop where the shipment was expected and was given two options: I could give them a warning, or I could leave. I wanted to let the Crew know that I was on to them, so I chose to give them a warning. Kelly blurts out, ""You gotta be more careful with your shipments. the Mafia is on to you!"" Ugh! So I reset the day and try again. This time I replayed all the way up until the same moment but chose to leave...and because I'd refused to help the Mafia, the game decided that the shipment wouldn't show up, so I never got a chance to at least check the van for a parking infraction or tire violation so that I could get probable cause to investigate further.Other bugs plague the game too...multiple times I would try to move and would just get stuck. The cursor would register the movement action, but Kelly would just stand there. The only way to fix it was to make him run, and then he would get stuck again. This happened repeatedly, intermittently. It was a pain.The NPCs walking around with random bits of dialogue are supposed to be funny and edgy, but they are just repetitive and offensive. The number of times I saw NPCs walking around talking about g**ks ruining the dry-cleaning was ridiculous. Like, multiple times on a single patrol, on a single day.If you do go in to inspect headlights, 75% of the cars that you inspect have the animation coded backwards: Kelly will look away from the headlights and away from the taillights as he inspects them. Brilliant.There's no way to prioritize urgent tasks if you're in the middle of an animation. For example, if you're in the middle of writing a ticket for a broken taillight and you get a call about a robbery, in real life you'd just forget about writing the ticket and go get the robber, right? Not Kelly. If you're writing a ticket and someone comes up to dispute it, no matter how urgent anything else going on around you is, Kelly will not end the conversation until he's had the last word. Usually, this means that the robber escapes with ease. Or let's say that you've arrested a guy for trying to sell you drugs. Obviously he's a low-level dealer. What if, while you're waiting for the paddy wagon to come pick him up, an armed robbery in progress happens ten feet from where you've collared the dealer? Can you draw your weapon and order the armed robber to drop to the ground with his hands out? No, of course not. All you can do is stand there like a chump while you wait for the overweight officer to sloooowly waddle up the sidewalk to take the dealer away. Well once the dealer's in the other officer's custody, time to run after the robber, right? Nope, you need to wait for the officer to get into the car and drive away before you can chase down the armed robber. And by then, he's long gone. I won't be playing the game any more. I was hoping to be a cop. I just feel like a puppet on a buggy, pixellated roller coaster. I'm glad I only spent $3.39 on this game.";9 October, 2021;
Beat Cop;ozoneEmerald;164 products in account;155 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 7.4 hrs on record;To those complaining about the repetitiveness of the game: it's a point & click adventure game – repetition sort of comes with the package. To those complaining about the offensiveness of the game – it's a game set a little under 40 years ago. Sexism and racism existed in pop culture much more prominently during that time than today's media, and I feel it would have disingenuous to omit the ugly parts of the past. I'm currently halfway done with Beat Cop and couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase. The game is based around following either morals or what benefits your character best, as well as picking sides between the Italian mafia, a local gang, and the police force. Each day has a different plotline to it with specific tasks assigned to you (you can choose whether to complete these or not), which has you running up and down the street all day. You have to manage your time effectively if you want to get everything done. Often point and click games get boring when there's not enough to do, but I really enjoy the fact that you get to pick your own tasks to complete. Overall, a very entertaining game :);2 April, 2017;
Beat Cop;Abexci;1,242 products in account;100 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 4.0 hrs on record;I honestly don't know how I've only played this many hours of the game - it feels like I've played it for so long. Not due to a perplexing time warp, that was last week.The game, however, is designed in little snippets that drag out through tedium and give the illusion of passing time.Beat Cop is beautiful, and I love both the story and the premise. The sounds, humor, the animation. it all is lovely. I appreciate the idea of having a single street that you are responsible for, and having to compromise between the interests of individual liberty, and remaining professional. Backing down from giving a ticket may harbor good will from the community, but it may get you in trouble at work - and vice versa. I love that!However, the game falls flat to the point where I could no longer muster the enthusiasm to return to it. Its worst aspects are in the characters, the morality, and the obtuse objectives.The Objectives are ram-railed into each day in an arbitrary nature. You may have to give out 15 tickets to meet your quota, but then - there is a murder in an alley and you take hours securing the scene and taking questions. In the chaos, punks try to rob some stores, and you have to chase them down and arrest them. Any police officer that covers a murder scene than single handedly stops 2 robberies is having a fantastic day, and should receive a commendation – but in this game, if you only come back to HQ with 14 tickets, you’re in for a reprimand and a dock in pay – which is huge. Time goes by quickly in the game, with real seconds translating into minutes – and entire game days going by in only a number of moments. You are asked to pull off the impossible by your HQ – but no matter how much you put into your routine, you will never get much out of it. Tow 10 cars, arrest 2 drug dealers, stop a robbery in progress, investigate a suspicious man, talk down a hostage situation – all in one day. But you didn’t walk up and down the entire street before noon – meaning a reprimand and a dock in pay.The Morality is also dubious. You are tasked throughout the game to come up with extremely exorbitant charges out of nowhere that are unrealistic and unreasonable. Got $90 to your name? A lawyer demands $600 in two days to pay alimony, there’s no legitimate way to earn that much money in such a time – so you have to do illegal stuff on the side, which I loathe. The entire point of the game is to rise above and beyond, but there’s no way to actually do it – you can’t play through the game without getting your hands dirty. You really don’t have a choice in the matter, and it’s not organic – it’s completely artificial. Every time you get ahead, there’s another unrealistically insurmountable charge that forces you to work with the mafia or gangsters for cash.And the nail in the coffin: the characters. The main character is passable enough – but he says and does some incredibly negative things that alienate him from a general audience. Worst yet, every single character in the game constantly berates, belittles, and bickers with you every step of the way. There is not a single likeable soul in the entire storyline – with the exception of the donut lady, who is the best.That’s really the impression I was left with in the game. It’s oppressive and disheartening with no light at the end of the tunnel. Intrigue is lost in a land of antipathy and impossible standards.There is only one way that you can play through this game.And it’s going to hurt no matter how you look at it.3.5/10It’s Flawed.In spite of everything that it does right, it breaks your bones with monotony and chastisement.;6 May, 2020;
Beat Cop;Reviews;NOT INFORMED;42 people found this review helpful; Recommended 12.0 hrs on record;It’s a jungle out there baby, and sometimes you just need something to release the stress...- Random officer?? Description:Beat Cop is a retro, pixel art style adventure that pays homage to the classic ‘80s police dramas. By starting small as a simple traffic controller, the player embarks on a journey full of bizarre adventures, involving drugs, murder and, of course, sprinkle donuts. Casual sexism and racism are also added to the mix, as the game satirizes perfectly the many stereotypes that defined those times. ?? Setting:SummaryIn this wretched jungle we call Brooklyn, an officer named Kelly got tangled up in a murky murder case. After being framed for the unusual disappearance of the victim’s diamonds, the new face around the block was given twenty-one days to prove his innocence. The former detective, who is now responsible for maintaining public order on the streets, will turn every stone in this city, with hopes of finding the real culprit. It is a jungle out there kiddo, so buckle up and get back to work!WritingThe beautiful aspect of Beat Cop is hidden in its witty writing. Every corner of Brooklyn’s streets triggers an unusual encounter that eventually leads to hilarious situations. Each encounter follows a specific dialogue tree, which in turn results in different scenarios and thus different endings. There are literally thousands of things the player can laugh at, as Beat Cop provides a plethora of interactions, even in places where no one expects. ??? Gameplay:The core mechanics of the game revolve around completing tasks that are assigned during everyday briefings. Those activities include writing tickets, catching criminals and so on. At the same time, the player can only move in two main directions, as well as enter many buildings. Each shift runs from 9:00 am until 6:00 pm, with each hour of the day being roughly two minutes of realtime. When the shift ends, the player gets a rundown of their actions.ImmersionThe gameplay can be divided into two main paths (the main story and the side missions). The players’ main objective is to uncover the mystery regarding the stolen diamonds introduced in the prologue. While exploring the streets of Brooklyn, they will be forced to settle into the role of a cop by writing tickets and responding to calls from the HQ. On top of that, a variety of optional tasks will also be introduced that will provide positive or negative outcomes.No handicapsThe most surprising detail about Beat Cop is its lack of handicaps. Despite its simple nature, the game does not spoon-feed the player, making it harder to progress, if not given the proper attention. Mission objectives are scattered throughout the many street corners, that require good perception to notice. The game does not give any detail of what the player needs to do in order to succeed, on the contrary, it expects its playerbase to get involved in the adventure and thus become the cop themselves. Personally, I find such a feature really fulfilling, as it discourages blind actions. Writing ticketsIn my opinion, it is the most “monotonous” side of the gameplay spectrum that needs to be addressed. While many find it tedious and somewhat disappointing, I personally enjoy the repetitive nature of this task, as it leads not only to interesting NPC interactions, but also provides a somewhat pleasant distraction from the main objective. It really reminds me of the reminiscent Papers Please format, where a simple task, if handled correctly, can turn into a fun loop.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2837794907Time management The main challenge of the game resides in a time managing process. Most of the time, various tasks will contradict one another, forcing the player to choose one in favor of the other. With careful planning, the player can balance the objectives, but no matter how organized they are, there is plenty of stuff that can be missed, including missions, secrets and references.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2837797035FactionsThere are three main factions in the game - the mafia, the crew and the police. Each organization expresses their motivation openly by offering tasks and rewards/punishments that rely completely on various outcomes. The player can either stabilize rising tensions or provide his whole attention to the needs of a faction, which in turn unlocks interesting plot paths.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2837795668????? Visuals:The pixel art style bears fresh air to the streets of Brooklyn, with beautiful scenes that interact with the player’s in-game choices. Each day feels unique, from the crowded streets to the almost deserted dangerous corners, where gangs engage in conflicts and rap battles. The shops, as well as the NPCs, are beautifully designed with fancy clothes, reflecting either their status or their alignment to a specific faction.?? Audio:The soundtrack of the game provides the unique 80’s feeling that personally reminds me of the classic cop shows. As far as sound effects are concerned, it is clear that lots of effort has been put into the details, with each shop and building having a unique tune playing in the background.??? Side Notes:Bugs were the main issue of the game, which sometimes made it almost unplayable. Thanks to the overwhelming support of the developers, nowadays, such obstacles are rarely encountered. Despite all the fixes, a rare bug that prevents movement can still be experienced. Just restart the day through the menu option and everything should be fixed.?? Verdict:Beat Cop is a charming game that relies heavily on repetition. It is a short adventure that takes the player back to the mid-’80s, making it a beautiful pastime worth sharing. It is an engaging experience that will definitely question the player’s moral choices by touching upon the different dilemmas of its troubled era.Follow our Curator page,;20 July, 2022;

NEGATIVE POINTS:- ...although at times it can be confusing.- It takes a while to get used to the control if you are not used to it.- Moving from one dialogue to another has a certain delay, which is annoying.CONCLUSIONS:""Asleep - Ato 1 is a video game that manages to capture the essence of classic psychological horror adventure games in an outstanding way, with a truly intriguing story and a unique setting.The point-and-click control may put some people off, but if you love psychological horror games you should at least try it for a while, because once you get used to it you'll be hooked.EVALUATION:8,5/10.If you like horror games and pixel art, don't hesitate: buy this game, you won't regret it: I can't wait to play the second chapter!"; 25 May;

Asleep - Ato 1;artwork;NOT INFORMED;10 people found this review helpful; Recommended 5.9 hrs on record;With 1,400+ reviews, make sure to follow The Cpt Froggy Club Curator Page for plenty more!You wake up alone in a bedroom. You get up and walk out the door. Everything and everyone looks unfamiliar to you. You can’t remember where you are. You’re scared, and your anxiety is rising. Is this even real? Asleep is a psychological horror indie game. There are plans for four chapters, but there is no set date at the moment. It has been developed by Black Hole Games and published by Nuuvem.Asleep is set in the Brazilian Northeast of the 90s. You play as Ana Lucia, a young girl plagued by nightmares. You first wake up in an unknown bedroom, so you get up and start exploring your surroundings. You’re confused and everything feels strange. Eventually you come across a woman who asks you to find her little girl. The only place you feel safe is the bedroom, but you’ll have to gather your courage and step out of the house. While you wander around the town, you’ll meet some terrifying monsters, and all you have as protection is your old flashlight. A main part of the game is about unravelling this mystery, so if you want to know what happened to Ana you’ll have to play and find out for yourself...Many important themes are brought up in Asleep: anxiety, nightmares, and even insanity. The storyline that has been constructed around these themes is very engaging. You never quite know if what you see is reality or your imagination. Even though this is only act one, it is still a self contained story in its own right. The developer has succeeded in creating a sinister atmosphere. The game doesn’t hand you the storyline, but it lets you discover it through collecting messages and drawings as you play.I played with a keyboard/mouse combo, but you could also use a controller. they both work equally well. The gameplay is relatively simple - a point & click mechanic for the most part. Walking and running uses WASD keys. The items that you can interact with will sparkle slightly. I love the combination between the more traditional point & click gameplay with horror. it works well together. There are light puzzles, mostly lock and key. The main objective of the game is to find the little girl. The whole map thus becomes a big maze. It’s nothing too complicated, but it does add some depth. The horror elements come mostly from the environment and some monsters. There is also a psychological component with Ana Lucia’s internal struggles.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3249621809Asleep is visually very beautiful. The game is done in a 2D pixelated style while the cutscenes are animated in a more realistic style. I love the art style, especially the cutscenes. Although they are scattered, I found them to be one of this game’s best features. The dark colour scheme of mainly blacks and purples fits perfectly with the horror theme. The music and sound effects add another layer that helps to create a great horror experience. The voice acting is also spot on. It sounds professionally recorded.The area covered in the game is of good size. What I didn’t like is that although the town is of a fair size, the map still feels empty. There are a lot of doors and entrances in the town, but unfortunately most of them are not available to enter. Only a couple of story-related areas are accessible. It does feel like the developer tried to make the town feel bigger than it in fact is. Another design choice I found perplexing is the singular save file. In this type of game you’ll want to reload a previous save when you die so you don’t have to restart. It’s usually nice to have at least the possibility of two. For some reason, the map only shows up in Spanish even though my language was set to English. It didn’t stop me from playing the game, but it would have been nice to have it in English.All of these are smaller issues, but there is one bigger flaw that I came across while playing. I didn’t finish the first puzzle in time (which was to unlock a door) so the monster unlocked and started attacking me. This shouldn’t normally be a problem as I should be able to restart at the same spot and complete this puzzle. If there had been more than one save, I could have reloaded a previous one. After dying, I tried to return and complete this puzzle. The problem is that when I attempted to do this, the monster was already unlocked and wouldn’t even let me get to this door without killing me. This door is important in the game because you have to go through it to progress. I had to uninstall, delete the data and reinstall the game to solve this issue. It has just released so I hope that those issues will be fixed, but it might deter some players from enjoying their playthrough in the meantime.Asleep is a visually outstanding game that offers a spine-chilling retro atmosphere which will keep you on your toes. The pixelated atwork is perfectly suited to the 90s vibe the creator was going for. The gameplay is simple yet engaging. It is not very long, most players should finish it in 2 to 3 hours. I would definitely recommend the first act of Asleep to point &amp. click and light horror fans, provided that the issues are solved.Positives; 27 May Prod;

Asleep - Ato 1;zender42;NOT INFORMED;6 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 3.2 hrs on record;"If I had to sum this whole review up in one word, it would be ""underwhelming"". There's a lot of things that indicate that this could have been an interesting world, an interesting adventure. But it's over before it even gets interesting. There's just no substance here. I took about 3 hours to play from start to finish, and I took my time. I was hoping for a lot more. Still, it was only $7.I played the demo quite some time ago, and even replayed it more recently. I thought it was quite decent, and showed a lot of promise. This game is probably a little less than double the length of the demo. There is very little story, only four total characters, of which one is the player character, and only one other has any real development / depth (or more than 2-3 dialog lines). It sets up a lot of different mysteries, but doesn't really do anything to answer to even flesh these out. I understand that this is chapter one, but I still expected more. The world is very shallow. Outside of the school, there is little exploration and almost nothing to find, other than a series of dead-ends and a few things that you can look at for some flavor text. The school is a bit better - there are corridors, doors, and different paths that you must take through them. There are even some (rudimentary) puzzles, mainly slightly convoluted variants of the classic ""find three X to continue"". You actually play through the school twice, after you find the girl, it changes into a bizarro-world version of itself, sort of like Silent Hill. Some doors go away, rooms change, etc. There's more/different monsters. After the school, there is a chase sequence that is just miserable to play. It took me at least six tries - the first two I had no idea what I was supposed to even do, then I lost two to game-breaking bugs. After you finally beat that, you get to slowly walk (running disabled, yay!) through several character-development-by-exposition-dump scenes, and then that's the end.The gamepad controls are inconsistent. There are times when the gamepad just won't work to advance dialog/narrative text, you have to use the mouse or keyboard. There is even one time (during the final chase) where you have to jump down off of a box, but there doesn't appear to be any way to do so with the gamepad or keyboard...you have to click on the ledge. I hit several bugs, all related to movement. Most were minor, but there were a couple of game-breaking ones in the final chase. Overall the movement leaves something to be desired.Some of the game mechanics are poorly explained. It took me a while to figure out how to move crates. There's impassible black goo on the floor in some spots that I had to watch a YouTube video to realize that you have to shine the flashlight on them to make them go away. There's some odd looking black objects on the wall in places that I saw in that same YouTube video the person fixing....I never could figure out how they did that - they don't appear to be interactable. The limited inventory space and non-stacking of items is kind of frustrating, but the game was so short it didn't really matter. I ended up with way more health and sanity supplies than I even used. I never did figure out what (if anything) happens if your sanity meter runs completely out. Mine was empty more than once, but if something happened, I failed to notice what. There's no way to skip ahead during about half of the dialog, which isn't the worst sin, but is annoying.I was really expecting more."; 13 May;

Asleep - Ato 1;(??_?);NOT INFORMED;4 people found this review helpful; Recommended 4.8 hrs on record;Asleep - A pixel graphic point-and-click horror game with puzzle elements that set in Brazil. The game's storyline is quite mysterious. This game reminds me of Alan Wake and Noxia Somnia. You can play using only the mouse. There are three types of enemies in the game: the first type reacts to you when your flashlight is on or if you make noise, the second type is scared of light, and the third type appears when your sanity level drops. Sanity is restored in rooms with light and by taking pills (same with health). As you progress, you will need to find items to advance in the game. these items will blink, and some are located in drawers, so you need to check them carefully. In certain rooms, there are mirrors that can transport you to your room where you can save your game. I really liked that you need to save your progress in a diary, and as you progress through the game, Ana fills it with her drawings and descriptions of what's happening. The game is also voiced. Among the downsides, at the beginning, it felt like the game had a lot of space for exploration, but there were too many dead ends and locked doors. Looking forward to the 2nd Act.????_??; 27 May Prod;

The movement can get messed up with trying to open doors, like the animation won't work at first and you have to keep clicking things for her to do it. Although maybe most people aren't having these issues, i have no idea. But even within the first 5 minutes she wouldn't move forward at the tree part. (Just example, obviously this fixed itself) That being said, I do appreciate all the work that went into this and I know it's a small team behind this so I understand. I do plan on playing the next chapter in the game whenever it releases. I just think certain things could use some more polish.

Forza Motorsport;Baby,;NOT INFORMED;803 people found this review helpful16 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 36.5 hrs on record;"I've been thinking about how to start my review for a long time. As a long-time fan of the series who has been playing since Forza Motorsport 2, who has played every game since then (including the Horizon series), who has pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition of every game, and who has invested thousands of hours of playtime in the series, I am at a loss for words.This is my first Forza that I've played mostly on PC, where I can switch between PC and Series X thanks to Cross Progression.Turn 10 has promised a lot in the past, the trailers often looked better than the finished games, but never has the gap been as wide as it is with this installment. At no point does the game look even remotely as good as the original trailers, even with the maximum details on PC it doesn't come close to the video footage shown in marketing events. Visually, the game fluctuates from ""quite respectable"" to ""really bad"", the latter especially when a vehicle model appears again somewhere that was copied over from an old game. ""From the ground up new"" this is not.The ""career mode"" is one of the most boring campaigns I've played in the genre, the AI drivers are dumber than ever and the content has been greatly reduced. Fewer tracks, vehicles and features but more bugs than ever. Crashes, disappearing track textures and geometry etc. are part of the game experience here, the list of known bugs is longer than some PhD thesis.Something must have gone wrong during the long development time. It remains to be seen whether Turn 10 can pull it out of the mud. At this point, I wouldn't recommend the game even to fans.";1 November, 2023;

Forza Motorsport;Sammypop;98 products in account;416 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 145.5 hrs on record;It has been about 3 months since the game launched, and at this point, I'm confident that it will never be updated into an acceptable state. First, a couple of good points:- The driving physics are a welcome step-up from the previous game. It feels tighter, more responsive and more precise.- They are slowly ironing out bugs. (Okay, so this should be expected, but I had to think of another positive for this game). On release, the game was quite literally unplayable for me. It's... well, *more* stable, now. And the bad:- Single player career. Hardly any events, all of which are short sprint-style races. There are no events with set difficulties to challenge myself with.- AI drivers. They simply can't race properly. I've seen them braking on the apex of a corner, and even on the exit of a corner into a straight. If I overtake on a straight, they sometimes swing out to hit me. I never get the sense of battling with another driver for pole position. it feels very static. The thing is, the AI CAN drive well, when they're alone. It often leads to most of the pack languishing as they constantly brake and refuse to take overtaking opportunities on the first lap, while the car that started first extends a large lead. Combine that with the short races in career mode, and you're in a mad dash to overtake as many cars as possible before you're held back too far by them.- Progression system. To upgrade your car requires that you drive it. The thing is, it takes hours to fully unlock the upgrades for a single car. Get a new car, you have to go through the same process again. This has knock-on effects for multiplayer and the Rivals time-trial mode, where you won't be competitive until your car is upgraded and tuned.- Graphics. Sure, there are some nice details, but it's all undermined by a horrible blurriness that I can't get rid of. It seems like there's some shoddy anti-aliasing going on, and there isn't an option to turn it off. Even upping the rendering scale doesn't solve the issue, leaving the game looking weirdly out of focus. It also goes for a washed-out, desaturated look which I personally despise.- Optimisation. I'm on a 5900X with 32GB RAM and an RX 7800XT. Even with ray tracing off, the game has places that consistently drop below 60FPS. Lowering the graphics further doesn't help, so it seems to be a CPU optimisation issue. For a game like this, consistent smooth performance is key.- Multiplayer. There's really nothing stopping other players from ramming you and ruining your game. There is a penalty system, but it's inconsistent in the magnitude of penalties, and who it considers to be at fault. I've had races with malicious players, but I've also had races with good, fair players. Multiplayer is limited to 60FPS for 'competitive reasons'.- Atmosphere. This is a bit subjective, I know, but the game lacks any kind of excitement or character. It just feels rather soulless and corporate. Overall, I very much regret my purchase. Most of my 'playtime' has been spent trying to figure out how to mitigate blurriness and improve performance. That was when I wasn't replaying events due to game crashes and it not saving my progress. Even now that the game is actually functional, I'm finding it a chore to play. It just isn't fun.; 6 January;
Forza Motorsport;SpaceDragoness;NOT INFORMED;541 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 2.5 hrs on record;"So, Forza Motorsport gets all the bad reviews and complaints for a lot of reasons, and i initially wasnt going to even bother with it. I figured i'd give it a good old fashioned, open minded try. Heres what i feel as someone whos been playing forza titles since the original forza motorsport way way back on the classic xbox. The physics are excellent and the racing is great. You can really feel the difference between cars and the upgrades. Cars feel immersive, and in a racing game i feel thats important. The cars just feel good to drive, and the track points system (however forgiving it might be) actually encourages you to do better, and helps you see where your laptimes are suffering. The adjustable AI ""Speed"" is pretty on point. Maxed out requires you to be perfect. A few notches down from that and you really just have to give it your all. Turn off the assists and try your hardest. Thats the wonderful thing Forza Motorsport got right. It encourages you to try and enables you to push your skills while giving you an immersive feel and the feedback to do better at each turn. Unfortunately thats the only real positive thing i have to say about the game. It is an excellent game if you are just playing by yourself, intent on learning each car and trying to push yourself. The rest... where to begin.Its not the prettiest game in the series for a start. A lot of effort was put into most of the car models (some of them are old models from previous games from what i understand) and the environments, but its pretty hard to balance a realistic look and an over the top pretty look. It falls flat here. Compare it to Horizon 5 or FM7 (yes i know Horizon isnt the same developer, but thats not the point), where you had either extreme and you can see how its just a greyish brown muddling of the two styles. There are other racing games in the same league as Forza motorsport that look FANTASTIC, with the best combination of both worlds as far as looks go. Its disappointing. The variety as a solo player is awful. Yes, you do have quite a few cars to choose from. Yes, there are quite a few tracks to choose from, but more content =/= more variety. All of the tracks sans the classic nurburgring and de la sarthe are just kind of... plain. They're all pretty similar in length and complexity, a pretty bland course selection. Unless you're a hardcore F1 fan the track selection isnt going to stand out. The previous motorsport games did pretty well to add completely left field fictional tracks to break up the monotony. None such here. The car selection feels as if its been hit with the ""no fun allowed"" rule. Lots of popular street machines, lots of historic race machines, but nothing to really break it up. You have 'racing cars' this time around and little else. Sure, the whole premise of Forza Motorsport during its development was to make it a game centered around racing, make you feel immersed with the selection, but this ultimately limits you to doing just that and little else. I say again, more content =/= more variety. On top of this, there are 'seasonal' events. Content that can be missed, cars that you might not get another chance to get for months depending on what the devs decide to do. Games like Forza Horizon make it feel fun, you can earn your limited time things in one sitting. Gran Turismo is the same deal. Short, quick events with a nice prize at the end. Forza Motorsport has somehow made it feel a chore, with the bland variety of cars the developers have chosen to stick to as your reward. Furthermore, and i hate to agree with the general public on this, the game really does feel unpolished. Its not the most smooth or fluid game to play, the UI feels a little clunky at times, the load times and performance even on top dollar machines can be a bit sporadic, and for all the attention to detail the game promises you can still catch glimpses here and there where they cut corners to get the game out. I wouldnt go as far as saying that it plays like its ""Unfinished"" or its a ""Prototype build"", but you can tell where their priorities were when developing the game, and those parts are, fortunately (or unfortunately depending on how you feel), fantastic. Lastly, and probably the thing i dislike most about this game, is the way it comes off to me. From the first minute you start playing you run through the introduction, the opening bout where you chooch along on maple valley raceway just to get a feel, on to an LMP car and then your first series. Theres no... sparkle. Theres nothing to entice you. It doesnt make you feel special. Theres no Stinger. No draw. Nothing that makes you sit back in your seat in awe or anything that hypes you up. It feels like you're supposed to come in knowing what it is and what to expect. Its a Forza Motorsport game for players who played the previous games, people who followed the development of the game and stayed excited for it, riding the name of the franchise and all its history. It just comes across as cold and unwelcoming to new players to the franchise, and lackluster and disheartening to longtime fans. Would i recommend this game? Sadly not. I want to love it, and im going to play it here and there because of how awesome they got the physics portion down. So unless you're like me where all you want to do is systematically tackle the Nurburgring with every car on the hardest settings with no assists for fun, you are probably not going to enjoy this game. Its not a bad game. Its just not a good game. And as im sure everyone knows, that means its forgettable. My recommendation? Pick up Forza Motorsport 7. The physics are still great, it is much more polished and still looks pretty good for its age. The car variety is excellent, the track variety is excellent, the feel and immersion is excellent. Its an enticing game to play. It feels special. It welcomes anyone and everyone to the world of Forza Motorsport and all it has to offer. Its Forza Motorsport but better, and that says a lot."; 28 March;
Forza Motorsport;pushed_pork;NOT INFORMED;489 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 212.3 hrs on record;"Have played every Forza title since FM2 and huge fan of the series. Highly recommend finding a grey market FM7 copy and waiting for the devs to release content that's clearly being intentionally held back from this game to pad ""seasonal"" content schedules.Pros:+ The 'ground up' physics engine and handling feel noticeably better, if familiar.+ The weather system is good, but not perfect.+ The sound design is excellent relative to past Forza titles.Cons:- Bizarre car catalog, bizarre removals, bizarre amount of recycled models from 12 years ago.- Leveling mechanic makes sense but is a forced constraint that ultimately needs tuning.- The upgrading menu lacks a ton of information, no more dyno charts, no ability to preview sound, no ability to see details/changes at a glance (eg +13hp)- Did I mentioned the recycled models? This game is the most offensive yet in terms of model inconsistency- Menu system is awful- Overall content is about 50% of what it should beOn its strengths alone, the game is legitimately a 7/10, but knowing how many egregious missteps there are, them charging $70-100 for this title means that, at best, it's a 6/10 overall and in terms of sheer value. This is the most disappointing entry for the Forza franchise by a landslide.";11 October, 2023;

The game had more development time than any Forza Motorsport game since the original and they have barely anything to show for it. Just a list of problems that come to mind:Almost nothing Chris Esaki promised came to fruitionThe graphics are far worse than were shown in trailersThe game is riddled with bugsThere's no effective anticheat onlineThe game requires you to be online to play the singleplayer career modeFOMO mechanics requiring you to complete career tours in a certain time period or miss out on exclusive carsCar models from the Xbox 360 era gamesCareer mode is even more bare bones than Forza Motorsport 7'sTracks that were in Forza Motorsport 7 when it launched have been withheld from this game to release as ""content updates"" at a later date, including iconic tracks such as Daytona and the NordschleifeAI is somehow worse than previous titles. It struggles to make its way through a chicane if there is another car even remotely close to it.Race tire compounds were implemented in the most haphazard way and have made race tires severely overpowered compared to other tires because the soft compound is not taken into account for PI calculationsTire wear modifier in online races, but for some reason cannot be set in other areas of the gameCan't set the starting order in any meaningful way in Free Play: no qualification, no grid seeding, it's either by PI or random.Updates are only released monthly so no matter how big or small a bug is, it won't be fixed for at least a month (including bugs that make the game literally not launch for some people).Penalty system is more likely to penalize you for being rammed than for ramming someoneOnline skill/safety ratings are entirely meaninglessYes, I have a lot of hours played because it's a Forza game and we've been desperate for a new Forza Motorsport game for a while now. But if you're not heavily invested into this franchise already like I am, don't bother getting invested now. It's a dying franchise run by incompetent devs who will ban people from their official forums, Discord, etc. for talking negatively about the game calling any sort of criticism ""toxicity.""Turn 10 Studios is a joke.

Hogwarts Legacy;Kamatrix;278 products in account;433 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 26.0 hrs on record;A very fun but not perfect game:What I liked:- You don't need to know every Harry Potter book/movie before playing Hogwarts Legacy to get immersed into this world- Hogwarts and its surrounding areas are built in high detail and provide an awesome atmosphere- Exploration is fun, as the world is believable and well designed- The combat system seemed unusual at first but I ended up loving it. Might actually be one of my favourite mechanics of all video games I played: It is fast paced, dynamic and (at first) challenging, but once you get the hang of it, the fluid combat is just satisfying- Some of the quests were really funWhat I didn't enjoy:- After an interesting start, the first third or first half of the game felt repetitive and somewhat tedious: To learn Spell X you talk to professor Y but he or she won't teach it to you unless you do some basic fetch quest type of tasks first. Learn the spell and repeat the process over and over again- This way of storytelling repeated all over the main quest line. The main quest itself would have been several hours shorter, if the people you need information from would just give it to you. Instead, you often end up having to do them some favors first or do preperation work. This does in fact make sense and wouldn't be an issue, but after a few hours you start to notice this repeating pattern. (The second half of the game is more interesting in my opinion)- The game would have benefited from more depth in terms of RPG mechanics. Meaningful choices, more interactions in the open world. The majority of NPCs in the game are just for decoration (e.g. generic students all over the castle) but only a small amount actually has a purpose for the quests.;7 August, 2023;

Hogwarts Legacy;Supermarine;1,181 products in account;336 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 72.0 hrs on record;"You play as a student at the most famous magical school of wizardry, and will follow along the expected milestones of the academic year—you’ll attend classes, learn new spells and skills, help both teachers and classmates and unravel a mystery regarding a powerful enemy. It’s as Harry-Potter-esque as it gets. If you loved the movies and books, this game is a must-play.The gameplay is just as you’d expect for a student in the HP universe, complete with the selection process in charge of a talking hat, socializing with (or antagonizing) your colleagues, wandering around the castle and getting into trouble. Short of impersonating Potter himself, this is the closest experience you will get to enrolling in a Hogwarts school year. Of course, there is no Voldemort, but the story is sufficiently similar, and you will still feel like the prophetically-foretold boy who lived.You can customize your student’s looks, clothing and even your magic wand and broom. The options are not a lot, but still serviceable enough. Naturally, you can belong to any of the four Hogwarts Houses, and you will be given the corresponding uniform and colored accessories. You’ll find a lot of clothes in your adventures, and each item provides different bonuses to your character. Interestingly, you can change the looks and keep the features, which means that you can always look the way you want, and have the combat perks you most like or need. This is an excellent feature.Despite the emphasis on the wizarding experience, I believe the star of the show is Hogwarts itself. The castle is huge, rendered beautifully, and chock-full of secrets and places to explore. Ever wanted to wander around the school and grounds and see the places barely mentioned in the movies? Now’s your chance. And it’s every bit as fantastic as you imagine. Discovery is the name of the game, and every single location you’ve heard of in the books is here, and then some. Mind you, this is Hogwarts, not London—so no Ministry of Magic and such. Want to dare visiting the Forbidden Forest at night, looking for the dangerous arachnid lair? Try your luck at finding the common rooms of the other houses? Venture into the Library’s forbidden section? You can do all that. NPCs are quirky, diverse and in tune with the Potterverse. You will finally get to meet Peeves!Interestingly, there’s no curfews or hard enforced rules. Considering this is a school, and the importance of norms in the movies, this is weird—but perfectly understandable, from a gameplay standpoint. Still, there are moments when stealth is the better approach to trouble, and the student is perfectly capable of hiding and defeating opponents while unseen.Unlike with many games these days, I found myself avoiding fast travel almost every time. It’s nice to walk to the surrounding villages, and even nicer to fly there on your magic broom. You will find merchants, wild animals, rogue trolls, abandoned ruins and dark wizard camps. You can even explore ancient tombs, and there are many puzzles scattered all over the place for you to solve, courtesy of the late Merlin. Solving them will grant bonuses that aid you in several ways.The story is interesting, usually predictable and mildly convoluted. It also echoes Potter's journey with small twists here and there. The dark figure of the mysterious looming enemy is still present, only this time the goblins play a bigger part. As usual, there are undertones of real-life problems, like racism and segregation.An interesting choice regarding ethics is the use of the Unforgivable Curses. This topic is dealt with somewhat lightly, but the implied values and decisions are still there. Will you become a pre-teen murderous criminal and use these curses indiscriminately? Your choice. As for me, I decided I wouldn’t—and this meant a whole branch of the skill tree was unavailable to me. While you can’t pickpocket and rob to your heart’s desire, you can most definitely steal from every home in Hogsmeade, even in front of the owner, with no consequence at all. From a modern gaming perspective, I expected something less immersion-breaking.The music is fantastic. Not Williams, but deeply reminiscent of his work. Once again, the similarity was pushed to the limit, stopping only short of exorbitant royalties. You’ll recognize the notes and motifs over and over, and it’s never invasive in terms of gameplay. Some comments from your character can get repetitive, though—and the flu stations suffer from the same.The Room of Requirement is at your disposal as your main base of operations. You can decorate it to your heart’s desire, and gradually expand its size and functionality as the story progresses. Different props and magical stations will become available to find or purchase, and you can place them wherever you want. Eventually, you’ll get your own magical spaces to keep fantastic beasts like the famed magizoologist of the movies. The potion-making mechanics, however, are cumbersome and—at least to me—almost completely unnecessary.True, there is little variety in the enemy department. Combat mechanics are a bit simplistic, but serviceable. The student is not very agile, but it works well. Sometimes the enemies will feel bland. Unlike Voldemort and his minions, these guys lack depth and personality, and you will frequently end up fighting and defeating mindless golems and statues that always act and look the same.The graphics are really beautiful. And not only the world: the map, the cards, everything contributes to the gorgeous look of the game. A general sense of quality can be seen everywhere. The details are wonderful and always in line with the Potter universe.The voice acting is excellent, varied in mood and accents. The only ugly detail is the sound editing, especially the pitch slider for the main character’s voice, but this is also present with other characters and even cats. This produces weird sound aberrations that are sadly somewhat common.I did encounter a pair of bugs, but not game-breaking ones. In a weird case where my character clipped into a wall because I tried to use the broom too close to it, the reverse action solved the problem. I am aware of the complaints by other players, but for me it was a stutter-free experience, with no crashes at all, although texture popping can break the immersion from time to time. Loading times are not annoying save for the ""shades loading"" that always happens at launch.I used the Xbox One wireless controller to excellent results.In terms of mechanics, Hogwarts Legacy is plagued by a sign of the times: lots of errands, collecting items, fetching quests, and the like take place in a very large open world. The beautiful castle and scenery help in that department, and you've got travel points, a flying broom and a magical steed to aid you in your travels. Thankfully, there are no microtransactions, gems, crystals, or any other annoying token currency so common today. Sadly, no Quidditch!I could not help but to feel a little empty at times—in Hogwarts Legacy, the sense of “game-ness” is a bit painful, given the wondrous world and potential for immersion. The game could be much better with a bit more complexity, from more interaction with the environment to maybe better customization options. However, the game is complete and functional as it is, and I understand why these design decisions were made.The price is a little high to my liking, but with a 15-20% off it would be fair.Playing Hogwarts Legacy has left me a sense of wonder I have seldom felt in a game lately. Even the story itself evokes that of Harry, and purposefully so. But it works. If you are a Potter fan, this is a must buy. You'll thoroughly enjoy the experience. This is the best alternative yet to be a Hogwarts student.Charmingly recommended.";26 November, 2023;
Hogwarts Legacy;alone;NOT INFORMED;6,639 people found this review helpful122 people found this review funny; Recommended 89.3 hrs on record;Decorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! The Combat:What would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. Fighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. For your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.The further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.As a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.The RPG Part:There is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.I just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work!

PlotThis game has plot a lot worse than Talos Principle 1.While there IS more plot in this one... It's naive. This game robs the player of the identity that was established in first game, then paints problems in a naive way. While the plot is kinda branching I'd say it's a plot on rails that are vague and at the end You are presented with A,B,C choices. While TP 1 was true science fiction in nature, TP2 jumps into fantasy realm bringing the meaning of universe into an equation (sic) that AI achieved in under a thousand years. There where only few dialogue choices that felt mature considering overarching topics adressed in the game.It felt like an expanded light novel fan fic based on first game.2. PuzzlesMost of the puzzles were really easy, Talos 1 and Road to Gehenna were much more difficult. I feel like some puzzle elements were introduced just to leave space for future dlcs.3. GraphicsWhile overall visual appeal is better than first part the game is mostly atrocious in 3d rendering, but beautiful in still images. Like it was made to look good on screenshots. Permanent TAA and downscaling generating flickering when moving almost made me refund the game at the very beginning. And I was wondering why the epilepsy warning was so emphasised when launching game...4. Music / sound.The best part of the game. Period. I will listen to the soundtrack on a regular basis definitely.Overall I do not recommend the game.Edit:Forgot to add - why would You create huge open world and then not fill it in some way?

I've played Men of War since the beginning and I have almost 1000 hours in MOWAS2 and they developed this game in a completely different direction. All they needed to do was just remake AS2 with better sound and visuals. Why fix something that isn't broken?where are the skirmish missions? I don't want to have to play attack and then defence and so and so.the UI is awful, it's so difficult to do basic things like seeing which troops you have selected.

The only valid criticism is online only one, which is being fixed.You get:3 Campaigns, 1 per each factions, with 6 big missions each, each with dynamic triggers, cutscenes. Hell, a german campaign literally has protagonists with backstory and character development. Campaigns also reward you with multiplayer units2 Historical operations campaigns, 7 missions each. Pretty much more freeroam version of campaigns, with ability to edit unit compositions and based on historical operations.6 bonus missions.4 fronts for raid generated missions against AI, that act as short procedural campaigns, 16 missions each.Fully working conquest mode, aka actually fun version of conquest from Gates of Hell.All above works in Coop, no need to setup saves, recreate seperate lobbies, you just invite your friend in a team as you would for multiplayer and you can switch whatever you want to play right away.3 multiplayer factions, 3 PVP regimes, 15 doctrines for each faction with hundreds of units.Working replay system, functioning planes.Actually working player units AI!Your units will actually focus on higher threats, your infantry will actually try to kil the enemy, your antitank infantry will ACTUALLY FOCUS TANKS. Your soldiers will actually throw AT grenades if enemy tank is close enough, and they will do it automatically, without you having to babysit them.Actually helpful and not clutter af UI, ability to edit shortcuts for every single button, intuitive signs for units to display if they are hidden, visible, or partially revealed.Functioning and FUN multiplayer with dynamic frontlines (Like in Steel Division), no longer a freaking slugfest of direct control abuse like in former iterations of the game. People actually try to storm your defences.Pretty much the best trenching and defence system in modern RTS games so far.You can just draw any trench shape you want, adjust amount of firing position points and watch your soldiers prepare the defences. And yes, using actual trenches manuals from real WW2 does help you to mitigate artillery barrages if you dig trench in a proper shape, rather than a straight line.Engineers, bunkers, mines, traps, medical tents, supply depots, everything can be built and everything actually helps with the defences and supplies. On top of it, you can also fortify buildings to turn them into makeshift choke points.Oh and yea, the stupid ""range limit"" system is gone, where your tank would refuse to shoot at 181 meters, but would shoot at 180. Now you have unlimited range, but have a spread penalty, which is how it should have been from the get go.Now compare that to CoH3 launch with 2 broken campaigns, freaking placeholders with icons from coh1 and coh2 and CTA:GOH with braindead AI, half broken campaigns unplayable in Coop, absolutely clunky and laggy controls, bugged 4k support, DLC for an abandon ware, DLC for DLC to get more units, DLC for DLC for DLC to finally get US, still broken pathfinding and AI after all these years of development and devs banning any criticism on their steam forums.This game does not deserve mixed feedback, same as GoH does not deserve a ""very positive"" one.UPD.Addressing some of the bogus claims of other reviews https://imgur.com/a/CrWZbKV since they quickly disabled comments after being called out:""- Tanks have health bars, not penetration mechanics. Awful, awful system. In addition to that, competitive play more or less requires you to play the Germans, because if you aren't playing the meta (German Heavy Tanks), you will get steamrolled.""Tanks, even in competitive mode (the hp bars one), still have penetration mechanics.On top of it, nothing prevents you from going and playing realism mode instead in ""PVP classic"". (Literally MOWAS2 classic point capture one)Current meta is US howitzer artillery regiment.""- Command Points system which means instead of the full MOW experience of having multiple tanks & a platoon of infantry to play with you end up with 5 blokes, 1 tank and a supply truck, and if you call in towed artillery which gets hit & decrewed YOU CANNOT RECREW IT. Idiotic design decision.""The CP system was in MOWAS2 https://steamcommunity.com/app/244450/discussions/0/352792037317781035/ and you were always limited by the cost of the unit. In fact, you could buy an officer unit to extend the command limit. This system is improved in this game, since you can actually recall units to base in order to free up limit, instead of being forced to kill them.And yes, you absolutely can recrew everything that has not been completely turned into scrap, including artillery and tanks. Unless, obviously, you are at your command limit.""- Artillery has this weird spotting mechanic that rewards staring at your enemy's spawn looking for the firing indicators and then nuking enemy artillery once the arbitrary spotting mechanic reveals the position of your unit. Towed artillery is pretty useless just for this reason as the game is under the impression that WW2 artillery worked on shoot and scoot mechanics that only became popularised AFTER the second world war, instead of saturation fire. CP mechanic also doesn't allow you to get the guns in play for saturation fire.""The spotting mechanic is not arbitrary at all. Every single artillery unit has an amount of detection chance based on their firepower, it is displayed by a lamp sign near the unit UI. If the sign is green - the unit is having a firing cooldown, and is not yet displayed on the map. If the lamp is red, that means the unit has fired quite a few times and too fast, so the enemy can now know a relative positioning of it, you should stop firing and wait for it to cool off. If there is a red eye, that means the unit is now spotted after you have fired too much and too fast and is now visible. You should reposition it and wait for a while.In fact, towed artillery is currently one of the strongest in the game, because players who are calm enough to not shoot at everything constantly almost never reveal it.Such players are to be countered by using artillery spotters or saboteurs to infiltrate the front."; 15 May;

Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition;changes;NOT INFORMED;113 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 31.3 hrs on record;This remaster does a good job of updating UI, graphics and fixing the home city mechanics that put a lot of people off of playing multiple civs in the previous release. Mostly everything enjoyable about the original core gameplay is kept present in this release.The new civs are pretty cool but not exactly revolutionary or game-changing in the ways Asian Dynasties/ Warchiefs were. Sweden is essentially a splice-up of other European powers whilst Cusco (Incas) is essentially a more AOE2-like warchief civ. Overall the content actually added by the release is minimal but functions and is the first in a long time. The team has made some strange artistic decisions in the name of historical accuracy. For a game that was not particularly historically accurate (or even intending to be) much of the effort in re-releasing this game has gone into changing the way colonialism and native Americans are represented in the game. The names of most of the first nation civs have been changed to endonyms e.g. Iroquois being changed to the Haudenosaunee which is not exactly an issue by itself. However, it brings up the question of why other civs haven't been changed to reflect their own endonyms. Why are the Indians not Bharat? Sweden Sverige? or Germany Deutschland? This seems like a very Americentric design approach based off of recent historical revisionism, there is not really an effort to change the depiction of any Asian or European civs and the effort gone into changing the (admittedly crude) representation of native Americans is ultimately jarring as it cuts and rearranges elements of the game. Elements of audio are awkwardly cut and changed with new voice acting that is honestly pretty poor in performance. Ultimately some of the changes to civs actively make them worse to play. Perhaps the biggest problem with the revisionist element of this remaster is the fact that near all mention of 'colonialism' is erased from the game. The Discovery Age is now the 'Exploration Age' whilst the Colonial Age is now the 'Commerce Age' and plantations are renamed 'estates'. From a historical perspective there was not really such a thing as a 'Commerce Age',;25 January, 2021;

The game had more bugs than a rain forest.They have ironed out a lot of bugs already, but more work is needed until the game is truly stable.However, the game is in a playable state right now and I took my time until i wrote my review, as I believe that you can only rate a game after at least a couple of weeks of playtime.It is a decent remaster, the network component of the game is infinitely better than the laggy experience of the original, the Swedish and Incas are a fun addition and the changes to the previous civilizations were smartly implemented.My biggest pet peeve right now is the UX design of the multiplayer, you can't whisper or invite anyone from inside the game (unless you are in a chat channel with them or in their clan), you need to communicate with them outside of the game (Steam, Discord, etc.)I hope it will get redesigned and this was just a barebones implementation.

Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition;pros:;NOT INFORMED;1,290 people found this review helpful26 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 96.5 hrs on record;Where to even begin... The cons and some comparisons to the original: They have sacrificed core mechanics of the game in favour of historical accuracy despite never being a historically accurate game in the first place. The native civs can no longer tame animals, which was one of their coolest features, and the North American natives can no longer mine and are required to construct an additional building to be able to acquire coin. Changing things in the game to be more accurate and considerate towards people who were presented in the game in a way that was ignorant or even disrespectful is fine, great even, such as changing the names of the civs to what they actually call themselves, but changing core mechanics and lazily introducing them is not. This is an absurd and unnecessary change that is an insult to veteran players.A major pet peeve of mine is the change from colonial era to commerce era. Are you trying to tell me that a game, that is built around the theme of colonialism, around the era of colonialism and who's entire gameplay is based around building a colony can't have the colonial era in it because it is too offensive. Was colonisation an awful thing for many people, YES, absolutely, but it happened and its what the game is based around, the game isn't making it out to be some glorious thing. This change of course does nothing to the actual gameplay so I'm not going to give up on the game just because of that but it is extremely idiotic and useless.Home city progression has been almost completely removed. You can still level up your home city, however, it only unlocks the customization options for the visual appearance of your home city and no longer unlocks shipment cards, as you now start with all of them. While this works great for multiplayer as you no longer have to grind of out matches to get the cards you need to stay competitive, it is awful for singleplayer. There is no more sense of progress or goals to work towards and the main replayability of singleplayer is simply gone. This is the change that makes me just not want to play the game, I used to love unlocking and experimenting with different makeshift shipment decks as I worked my way up to the more powerful ones, but that is no more.The UI is a complete and utter joke. The visual design of it looks as though someone made a bunch of text boxes in Microsoft Word and copied and pasted them onto the edges of the screen. The original AoE 3 had a UI design that was full of character and had amazing satisfying sounds to match. The definitive edition UI is completely soulless and had ear-piercing horrendous sounds mixed in with some rehashed sounds from the original version that somehow sound worse. To add on to this, the deck editing menu is nigh unusable, its essentially just a massive blob of the possible shipments you can use with very little sorting options. The original deck editor showed you what building the card type, what era you could get the shipments in and the progression trees all at the same time, allowing for easy location and identification of each card. In the definitive deck editor you can sort by age or by card type thats it, enjoy, and the cards are in a seemingly random order with no visual separation making it a long unsorted messy list of shipments that fit said categories. This only what I've discovered and thought worthy of mentioning in my mere 2 hours of playing the game. I've hear many other people mention how poorly optimized the game is but I have had no issues with performance as of yet, so be cautious in checking if your pc can actually run the game.;15 October, 2020;

They don't mesh very well and Iron Man just feels like a knock off of the film version instead of comics' Iron Man.";2 December, 2022;

This is in fact a Persona game in disguise, with a lot of effort put into all the characters. You're going to spend 60% of the time in the hub where you can theorycraft in the deckbuilder, and also talk to the characters in the hub, which you'll love doing especially if you're a fan of the comics. The other 40% of the time, you're going to spend it in combat, which is a mix between a card game and a tactical turn-based game that is quite nicely put together and very addicting.Those being said, while the game is not going to be for everyone, it's a fantastic product and i cannot recommend it enough.; 4 February;

Marvel's Midnight Suns;RadicalMooseLamb;NOT INFORMED;1,029 people found this review helpful19 people found this review funny; Recommended 110.0 hrs on record;"This game is being criminally rated currently. Rarely do I find that when I sit down to write a review that I agree more with critics over normal gamers. Lately I find though that people's complaints are grossly exaggerated. If you are seeing all the negative reviews let me give you the reality of the situation as someone who made it further than the first hour.Pros:+ Most of the voice cast are the official VA's who have voiced these characters for over a decade. Many people will recognize Captain America and Wolverine from anything outside of the MCU. The characters who have never been voiced in a game or more importantly a show use the actual real life voice actors like Nico.+ The story is far above average over your typical Marvel game. It has a darker more mysterious vibe that permeates across the setting. With plenty of dark history to retrace through the Abbey grounds. It starts more light hearted but grows darker as you progress and even the characters reactions change based on your current alignment.+ This is one of the first times outside of comics you've ever been able to associate with the normal lives of heroes. It adds a personal element to them not found anywhere else. Many have deeply criticized this aspect but the characters are extremely accurate to their current comic iterations. Some characters like Captain Marvel I don't particularly enjoy but that has nothing to do with ""bad writing"" and everything to do with that just being the way she is written in comics as well. Blade is fantastic.+ The Combat is outstanding, hands down the best card based battle system ever invented. Outside of just the card aspect this is one of the most compelling tactical RPG systems invented in over a DECADE. I play every tactical game I can get my hands on. The combat may seem simple because there is no cover mechanics or grid. But once you look past that you'll see the deep individuality of each characters play styles. It feels complex early on but than you get three more tiers of cards + upgradable options + even further in you get the ability to modify cards. There are so many tactical choices here. Many times you'll end up with so many cool choices it will become a difficult task to narrow down what you love the most.Cons:- Currently there is a bug when saving that can happen even when auto saving during battles that causes CTD's. As you can see I have a hefty number of hours in the title but can confirm its happened to me roughly 3 times where i physically lost progress (Usually about 20ish minutes of exploring the Abbey). And about 4 times with auto saves but with the auto save version I've never lost progress because it crashes after the auto save completes.- There is some shader stutter as people have mentioned but its largely front loaded (However it cannot be understated that the beginning sections are VERY significant in terms of the stuttering). Many have quit out angrily too early on to realize it disappears. I have not encountered any major performance issues after the beginning few missions. I have every setting at Max, RTX options on, and I'm playing on a large 4k tv.- Some characters while written well for who they are may not mesh with every person. Nico is written very accurately as a gen z teen and reflects that in the dialogue. Some may enjoy that some may not. But not every character is written in that way. Tony Stark and Doctor Strange are fantastically similar to their animated counterparts. ------------------------------------I want to wrap this up with a few other comments. First of all NO ONE should be judging this based on whether or not it is XCOM. I love XCOM, I beat both of them, I've played the originals a bunch. This is a NEW IP and for the love of god people we hardly get ANY new IPs nowadays. Stop tearing apart a game for something it was never meant to be. Secondly so many people have complained in negative reviews about micro transactions. This game at some point in the future MAY have micro transaction costumes. Currently it just had costumes that were part of the legendary edition and that's it. And allows you to simply purchase select few out of those if you didn't want or need all of them. THERE IS NO RESOURCE MICRO PAYMENTS. The resources are scarce not because it's trying to charge you but because it was made by the people who made XCOM. It's purely for difficulties sake. You get plenty and plenty of resources if people would actually play the game past the beginning.I would consider this game an 8/10 if you have no interest in Marvel but this is hands down a 10/10 game if you are a Marvel fan. If you've ever watched Earths Mightiest Heroes or played old Marvel Heroes because you had a desperation for true comic versions of characters this is an experience that has been long overdue.";7 December, 2022;

Yea, I had to write that in caps. You can run this on litteraly anything, even a potato plugged to any screen could produce playable framerates. As long as your graphics card supports DX11 (any card from 2010 and later) you will run this game. ONLINE The online mode is ok, not great. It suffers from lots of connection issues, lag and of course, microtransactions (??????? Konami). This is definitely not the main part of the game and you'll mainly be spending your time in the singleplayer. LENGTH It took me roughly 55 hrs to finish the game, doing mainly the story missions with quite a few side quests. I had the overall game completion around 60%. I have no doubt that if you want to reach perfect score for all the missions and complete every single side quest on the map you'll put at least 100 hours into this game. CONCLUSION A good final chapter to this series, even tho dissapointing in some aspects, MGS 5 manages to stay fun through it's incredible gameplay and have preety high replay value. The game is unfinished, the story isn't complete, we're missing the true ending that was supposed to be made, but with the current price it's still a very enjoyable experience.GRAPHICS: 9/10SOUND: 8/10SOUNDTRACK: 10/10GAMEPLAY: 10/10STORY: 6/10ONLINE: 5/10OVERALL: 8/10;26 May, 2016;

If you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is ""Everything is Awesome"", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. With 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. At the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.";4 September, 2021;

Overall it can provide a better narrative if you're interested. If you choose Fane just keep in mind his little quirks, like needing to keep his face covered at all times (he starts with a hood in his inventory)Don't be afraid of building your character incorrectly as you'll have opportunities to re-spec down the line, in the form of glowing green mirrors.Pick up a bedroll ASAP, as you can right click and 'use' it to fully heal your team between battles.Pick up a cooking pot and mortar + pestle immediately as well as they're required for craftingRead books! Certain titles will give you skill upgrades or crafting recipes, and some offer unique quests. (Also make sure Sebille eats body parts for the same reason! ... don't ask) Pick up a magnifying glass so you can identify items without begging for a vendor to do it.Physical Armor prevents physical effects, magical armor prevents magic effects. Melee enemies often carry more physical, mages carry more magical. Use this to your advantage.Levels matter. If you're getting annihilated by a fight, take a look at the enemy level and you may realize you're in over your head. Same goes for items! As you progress in the game even common weapons will start to outclass your early uniques - upgrade your loadout often!You will get a quest that gives you gloves of teleportation very early on. ABUSE IT. Big guy too close? teleport him away, in a fire. Archers annoying you? teleport them in front of your fighter.Finally, I think Sword and Shield fighters do the lowest damage in this game and using multiple hand-to-hand characters isn't very viable. (Keep in mind you can't shove people off ledges in this game!). I would recommend the typical melee, ranged, caster, and rogue for your first playthrough.DOS2 is old school turn based CRPG goodness but its difficulty can be a turn-off for some. Don't be afraid of choosing story mode if you need to.;31 August, 2023;

Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition;miltonwhatever;253 products in account;501 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 117.1 hrs on record;"If you're someone who enjoyed BG3 and is considering playing DOS2 (much like myself 117 playtime-hours ago), here's how these games compare:*Presentation- DOS2 has a really nice artstyle, not too different from BG3, maybe slightly more cartoony, but really enjoyable. Artstyle is a matter of preference, but to me it really works.- DOS2 doesn't have a cinematic presentation like BG3. So cutscenes are rare, not seeing your character up close acting the scene out is the only dissapointing aspect of the game when I compare to BG3.- Amazing voice acting.- The game runs smoooooooth. Specially compared to BG3 (which will probably improve with later patches, but currently DOS2 is a much more optimized game than BG3).*Story- The story is as good as BG3, with many story-beats reminding me of it.- Choices matter. Various different endings and ways to approach situations.- The companions are great in DOS2, but the interactions with them is not a prevalent aspect of the game, as it is in BG3. If you're looking to roleplay interactions with your companions, BG3 is way better for this.- The game is of comparable length to BG3, with just about the same amount of side content (Both games took me around 120 hours to complete on my first playthrough). This is likely going to change with time (as more stuff gets added to BG3), but if you want a lengthy game, DOS2 might be it.*Combat/Gameplay:- BG3 is a great implementation of DnD combat, so many things are dictate by luck (if Shadowheart misses one more time I am going to scream!). DOS2 uses its own system, and luck is a much less of a consideration. That gives you a lot more control in combat.- Combat encounters in this game are considerably harder than in BG3. This is potentially a great thing: harder encounters with less luck involved makes for a great challenge that rewards preparation.- There is a lot of build variety and many things can work. But my limited understanding is that there are clear ""better builds""/""better party compositions"" that can trivialize portions of the game. BG3 has the same problem (and in my opinion it is worse in BG3).- Interactions with the environment are way more prevalent in DOS2 (think burning oil, electrifying water, blessing surfaces, etc), and they are a very important part of combat. If you liked this aspect of BG3, this is even better here.- Non-combat checks such as persuasion also appear to be a lot less random. If you have enough skill points in persuasion (in addition to another primary attribute, the game always tells you which one is relevant) you simply pass the check. I love this. In practical terms that means there is a lot less save scumming in DOS2. In BG3 you could simply ignore charisma and charisma-related buffs if you just decide to save scum. This won't work in DOS2, and you will have to actively spend points in persuasion.- Pickpocketing is overpowered in BG3, you can completely ignore gold if you have a good thief in the group. In DOS2 you're limited to pickpocketing a NPC only once. This results in pickpocketing being still really good, but you have to think a lot more about collecting items for selling, gold management, etc. This is either good or bad, I personally prefer to not worry about gold, so BG3 is better in this aspect in my opinion.- How gear works is VERY different from BG3. In BG3 you have a very limited number of gear options (for instance, there's an excellent Cleric armor halfway act1, that you're likely going to use till the end of the game. If you miss it, there won't be another chance to find anything similar). Where gear is located is also fixed, in every playthrough of BG3 key gear is in the same place. In DOS2 finding gear is a constant dopamine hit: every container/vase/lootable body can contain randomized gear that scale with the area difficulty level (think Diablo loot system in cRPG form). In practical terms you're always managing your gear and constantly finding new gear (so remember to have a character with the Lucky Charm trait, that will help a lot). Basically if you love checking every container, you're going to love DOS2 (and if you hate that, this is something that will annoy you a lot).In summary, DOS2 is a masterpiece. It is 6 years older than BG3 and it certainly shows, as things like the lack of cutscenes are specially jarring after playing BG3. But other than presentation (where BG3 is the clear winner), those are both excellent games and depending on what you're looking for you may prefer DOS2.";12 November, 2023;

I was wrong. This game, despite being more than 6 years old, arguably packs even more content than BG3 did and has the same level of love, care and attention to detail put into it (No animated cutscenes with waifus though). It even suffers the exact same problem that BG3 did towards the end, where the last act felt painfully under-realized in the best possible way that leaves you imagining what could have been if Larian was given unlimited time and resources. If you liked BG3 then this game is a must play. An incredible fantasy adventure from the beginning to the end.

Content that was only available when basic fundamentals of the game weren't even working. They've since been fixed, but that content is now permanently lost, and that's a malicious practice.

Overcooked! All You Can Eat;A;NOT INFORMED;166 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 86.0 hrs on record;This game...I've played Overcooked 1 and Overcooked 2.I can say with certainty that this game is one step forward and two steps back. The remastered graphics and audio are well done. Lighting really makes the cartoony detail of the game world stand out as it should. The audio is much crisper and cleaner than the originals, making for a good experience for sight and sound. The UI has been reworked to be much cleaner and easier to use. you no longer have to scroll through a list of all the chefs to pick the one you want. There's a lot of chefs out there - not to mention the number of colour variants for each.However, that is where the positives end.The UI was remastered, yet for some reason one of the most annoying things about Overcooked's chef selection still remains. It does NOT save your last-used chef on quitting. Sound is always on full blast (RIP earphone users) on startup. I use the exact same chef every time, and deliberately have audio lowered so that voice chat is more audible. Why the player profile is not loaded on startup is beyond me. these little QoL adjustments would add that final bit of polish to a UI that is already well done.Multiplayer performs reasonably well at lower pings. At higher pings, the rubberbanding is insane. In this day and age, state rewind is not an impossibility. It does not matter if you are host. apparently, the anti-lag method seems to try to get an average of all the players' game states, resulting in a sharp jerk followed by a slow pull to your final position if you dash and then stop. My latency to my usual friends' group is approximately 120ms - not exactly ideal, but also not totally awful - yet I was rubberbanding to the point where it was frustrating. Even no antilag, client-authoritative state would be preferable (ala Overcooked 2) than this, where you can't even tell where your character is supposed to be.The controls are awful. I'm not sure what they've done with object interaction range, but I've noticed significantly more incidents of dropping a plate on a burner instead of scooping up the contents of a pot or pan. At best, the plate can just be picked up off the ground again. At worst? Your character can't decide whether to interact with the pot/pan or the plate. Combine this with tight kitchens and no dedicated button to drop an object, and your chef can be left holding something useless while being unable to switch to the intended object. When you can easily 4* every level in Overcooked 2 without any issues, and have severe problems with scooping up items like you used to, you know something has gone horribly wrong.I cannot justify the steep cost of this game (A$ 56.95) if you, like me, already have Overcooked 1 and Overcooked 2. The remastered graphics and audio are nice, but hardly compensates for the significantly degraded online multiplayer performance and atrocious controls. If you haven't got Overcooked 1 and 2, and you intend to play multiplayer on a couch, go for it by all means. if your multiplayer tends to be over internet, stay well away from this and get only Overcooked 2 instead.;1 May, 2021;

Every movement when the system works correctly is satisfying and leaves the player feeling in full control of their character. However, this is where SkaterXL's success ends. The game was rushed out of early access and hyped beyond oblivion with official skate companies, pros, and real-world professional tournaments, and held false promises of a consistent update model and fixes to issues that have plagued the game for nearly 3 years. Easy Day Studio is the defining error with SkaterXL, they lack any professionalism. They're delusional in attacking and threatening the modding community which makes the game remotely playable because they get their feelings hurt. Every update is in development hell with the most basic features that took a week by a modder over half a year to be incorporated. The game lacks optimization and runs horribly even with a 3900x and an RTX 3080. It is inexcusable to call this a full game, Originally posted by Early Access Steamworks Documentation: If your product is no longer marked as Early Access, the expectation from customers will be that your product is stable and delivers a complete experience. . SkaterXL is labeled at a $40 USD price tag, which is insane considering all that you are getting is 5 official maps, a player controller, and retextures of models to mark as customization. Multiplayer took over a year after release to be added, yet has nothing to actually bring players together - there needs to be challenges, game modes, or in-game tournaments. And despite complimenting the character controller earlier, it is plagued with bugs that destroy the enjoyment - and once was expected due to the development nature, is now unacceptable as a full release. Stay away from this game, I would mark it as abandonware at this point, I would recommend looking into Session, but it has its own issues, and sadly a fully-fledged skate game is looking like a few years away.;9 July, 2021;

BEFORE YOU BUY !!!Since there are a lot of new discussions about how the game isn't fun or lacks of content please read carefully before you buy and start complaining afterwards:1. This game doesn't want to be EA Skate or THPS. There's no story mode, no cutscenes, no progression. The only progression is your skill in skating and filming. If trying tricks or lines over and over again until they are perfect isn't fun to you, this game probably isn't for you.2. Although there are some nice maps in the game right from the start, you will have much more fun with the game if you use mods. Same for clothing, skateboards, griptapes, wheels, trucks. There a little in the game, but modding makes the game so much better.3. Physics are okay, but if you skate in real life it feels a little bit over. Jumps feel a little too high, if you want to film realistic looking clips you should use a mod like XXL Menu, where you can change gravity, pop height, flip speed and so on.What you will be doing most of the time: You find a spot and think ""Hey this trick would be cool here. So you try until you make it. And that's fun for some people especially those skating in real life. If you aren't and you are expecting some casual sports game like EA Skate for example: You probably won't have much fun with this game. You have to set your own goals and don't be afraid of modding, otherwise please wait for another skate game, that fits you better instead of complaining how bad the game is.And if you want a game where you can skate realistically, doing Ollies into banks, getting that perfect fs smith down that handrail, landing a really clean frontside flip down that 20s and then take your time cutting and editing your clips: Congratulations, this game is probably made for you.

While this game does have some solid game mechanics, the developers have made some bizzare choices recently.With very little in terms of challenges in this game, it is up to the players to make their own fun. That on its own is not a complaint but what is a complaint is the removal of features that made this game worthwhile given how little content is included.I originally bought this game the very day it was release on PS4 and again after building my PC. I had my fun with it but ultimately got bored playing by myself after completing most of the challenges. The introduction of the multiplayer beta had me very excited. It brought new life to the game. Initially, multiplayer provided a reason to come back to it and recommend it to others. My friends and I had found a very fun flow to our skate sessions. We would all skate around independently in a map, working on our own lines for as long as it took for us to get it perfect. Once one of us nailed it, we would call out to the others to come watch the replay. We all live in different places so the ability to see our friends doing a cool line in the game world while they were in a replay was incredible.Not only did this make it so that we didn't all have to stand around bored waiting for someone to land something in real-time. It also allowed for amazing replay possibilities. One player could land their perfect line, and continuously replay it in the replay mode while the other players try to land their line at the same time. After the second or even third player landed their line the result would be a replay with everyone nailing their tricks back to back even if they didn't happen at the same time. This was the entire appeal of playing this game with friends for me and my group. It was awesome and I convinced several people to buy the game based on this feature alone.One day we hoped online excited to skate around and to our disbelief the best feature of the game outside of the skateboarding was REMOVED. I can not for the life of me understand why the developers did this or who thought this was a good idea. It killed the game for us and I just haven't cared to go back to it since. There was a time where I did recommend this unique skateboarding game to people but I can't anymore simply because of the decisions made by Easy Day Studios. I would love for this feature to return as it would justify coming back to the game but until then, this game is dead to me.Pros- Decent graphics- Variation to tricks based on input- Solid basic trick animations- Soundtrack fits skateboard culture well- Community maps and content packsCons- Removal of gameplay features- Tone deaf dev team with a community begging for new content (especially on consoles)- Buggy environments with invisible walls when approaching obstacles from certain directions- Inconsistent grindable surfaces. Several obstacles that should obviously be grindable are not throughout the map list- Limited trick list.;24 June, 2021;

Skater XL - The Ultimate Skateboarding Game;austinonevia;NOT INFORMED;132 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 95.6 hrs on record;I tried this game before Session came out, and at the time, I didn't really enjoy it. I felt it had a severe lack of content, and the controls were just confusing to me at first. (I only spent maybe 30 minutes with the game before I returned it) Then after a while, Session released, and I bought it on release day. I was impressed with the content in the base game, I loved the level editing tools, and since I hadn't fully explored Skater XL's physics, I really liked the way Session played. I put quite a few hours into Session, pretty much exploring and completing everything. Then I bought Skater XL again, right after the beta with the new California skatepark was added. So much had improved, yet I still preferred Session, I guess because I had gotten used to the control scheme. Then I started seeing all of the different ways you could control your player in Skater XL, and how good some people in videos made their gameplay look. I gave Skater XL another go, this time really trying to learn how the controls worked while trying to block out every other control scheme I had learned from other skating games. This is when I really started to like Skater XL. The way you can tweak your tricks and style in Skate XL is unlike any other skating game. Now when I try to go back and play Session, the tricks and physics feel so stiff and everything looks like it is just an animation playing over and over again for the same trick. Skater XL keeps me coming back because of how fluid everything feels. Just a simple kickflip can be done in pretty much any way I can think of, and with the help of some modding tools, even more variations are possible.If you've been trying to decide between either this or Session, I highly recommend Skater XL. The physics are vastly superior to Session. While it might seem like it lacks content in terms of maps and skater customization, the upcoming July update looks like it will fix that. In the meantime, the modding Discord server has tons and tons of content to play with.Transition Update: The transition physics are so cool, they aren't perfect, but you can now do vert tricks that I haven't seen in many other games. I love doing nose and tail stalls, rock to fakie, and rock and rolls, they are pretty satisfying. The dev team also made custom clothing easier to add.;5 May, 2020;

The gameplay slaps, but most of the systems around it are flawed in one way or another.A lot of things that weres bad on release have changed, but the games still pretty far from ideal, plus FS decided to double dip into MTX shop, selling skins costing roughly $12+ for ONE character. And don't forget, it's been a year since release, so the game finally reached the ""mostly release-ready"" state in 11 months of work. *slow claps*Let me get this straight - Fatshark as a company are lying on a regular basis.Fatshark straight up lied at advertising. A lot of promo material weapons or cosmetics are unobtainable in game at launch, ability to obtain premium currency through gameplay was removed (and they were sneaky enough to edit this out of the discord post right before release), the crafting system that was supposed to be ready on release was added several months later. The promised story, but just used Dan Abnett big name as a promotion and in fact story does not exist at all, aside from couple of cutscenes. Weapon modifications system is scrapped , so you can't just attach flashlight/bayonet to a gun or get a better scope, despite it apparently being in the works not so long ago (but modders were able to restore it, so maybe FS will go through with it eventually).Release of the game that happened 30.11.2022 in not an actual release, it misses key features, and game stability was absolutely awful. You probably should already realise that from 54% all time reviews. Atm a year later it's relatively smooth sailing, but again - releasing the game in that state was an awful idea.A year later crafting notably improved, but new player will be met with a wall of grind to get the proper rolled weapon, find good blessings for the library and all that.The game still have Division 2 levels of loot stats distribution, making all weapons with bad base stats garbage even if properties and perks are amazing. This is still not addressed, so the game still wants you to check shop once per hour.Amount of content is still questionable, but much less so. Game currently features only 4 classes with 3 subclasses, making it 12 (opposed to 15 free classes V2 had on release) and amost every map in the game have a reused fragments of another map in that same location. Essentially, Weaves from V2 (same maps, but run backwards). Also, there is much more copypasted sequences (like defending while hacking servo skulls or killing small daemo-grown tentacles, these two appear on a lot of maps), which is mostly not the case for V2 where most of the events are unique and tied to a map. Plus, almost all weapons for 3/4 characters are literally the same weapons, every class have access to couple of unique items, but all generic rifles/axes/swords are the same for each class, diluting loot pool. Only Ogryn gets a full set of unique weapons, but then he have very limited options. Sadly, im not rewriting this, as FS added almost nothing new in weapon department in a year of work, and most described problems still apply. At least they reworked some weapons to stop being so bad. The game still reeks of ""effective management"", ""players engagement"" and ""retention"" a year later. Also, in game shop exploiting FOMO and does not allow you to buy items directly, instead forcing you to buy aquilas in packs and then spending aquilas on cosmetics. This is still true a year later, and it's becoming worse with introduction of ""premium skins"" that are just the most popular regiment like Steel . Do not support this BS, vote with your wallet. No skin in a game worth $10+. Also, just to give you insight, when initial backlash to MTX was addressed, they promised to add the 100 aquilas bundle, that would solve some problems with the shop.It was added, but it is hidden from the shop, and only shows when you try to purchase the item you missing 100 or less aquilas. Isn't that convenient, eh?The ingame mictrotransactions shop is taken directly from Fortnite or similar games, displaying only one set of cosmetics for each character at the time which got swapped each ~7-10 days. It initially had timers, which were removed after community backlash, but this is still exploiting FOMO, don't be fooled. Also, they added a ""convenient"" bundle to buy the most expensive skin sets with a direct price of ~10,5$ per skin (this is dinda funny, after initial negativiy the head of the studio said in the interview that they SIMPLY FORGOT to release this pack, of course, we totally believe this). For anything less than the most luxury pack you still need to sit in the shop with a calculator and try to figure out how much you want to spend and how much unused aquilas will be sitting in your inventory after you finished. And just to clarify - yes, the game is released in poor tech state, missing features, a lot of maps reuse assets (literally same parts of the levels but you move through them backwards), core mechanics didnt finished, but MTX shop is ready to use and spew 2 sets of skins and 2 hats for each class every week. Kinda ironic. Aldo adding, latest datamine showed around 150 entries with cash shop interface, including full sets, weapon skins and some separate pieces, so don't worry, Fatshark loaded this shop for the very long run. TLDR - shop is using predatory anticonsumer mechanics, don't support this, dont give them your money.And yes, people really just need to admit that after Tencent got their hands in the shares, FS just changed to worse. If you google it, chairman of the board is now chinese, same goes for non-executive, and whole bunch of staff from Level Infinite studio is listed in the credits for Darktide. In case you don't know, Level Infinite is studio that helps to design monetisation for Tencent owned projects if original studio can't make it itself. I am not putting all blame on them ofc, because this amount of incompetence and seling out should be okayed by the studio head honchos. I guess we should say thanks to them for appearance and implementation of MTX in Vermintide 2 and Darktide.The only thing that isn't broken is core gameplay. Combat is as fun as Vermintide 2 with added gunplay, but everything else surrounding the core gameplay smells bad, from progression systems to monetisation, from craft to in game challenges (these are clearly desinged with premades in mind, good luck doing them with randoms or solo), just put your finger on it - and find it broken in some way. Even a lot of basic QoL feaatures are gone. Most of the combad bugs are fixed too, so it's much smoother than it was on launch.Still, the last paragraph applies mostly unchanged:The game is manifest of what is wrong with the gaming industry nowadays - barely playable unfinished releases, already loaded with microtranscations, all mechanics are tailored to make people stay in game more (I have 200 hrs in the game, and have roughly 2 pieces of gear per class that are actually good, everything else is a pile of blue garbage), not have more fun or agency in terms of equipment. Current loot and progression somehow STILL much worse than both V1 and V2, and have no respect for player time. Maybe they need another year to address the remaning problems.";25 December, 2022;

Darktide is one of the best looking, feeling and sounding interpretations of the Warhammer 40,000 universe that has ever been released. Yet, it came out clearly too early and had many bugs and a poor progression system, with an in-game shop prioritised over promised features. That being sad, 10 months post release and after many, many patches, including the recently released complete rework of the class talent tree, it finally feels like Darktide is where it should have been at launch. Darktide is incredibly fun to play, as you slaw hordes of heretics with probably the most satisfying horde combat in a game yet, with the incredible soundtrack playing over the carnage and a near perfect rendition of a hive city it is incredible. The melee is an upgrade on Vermintide 1 + 2s, the shooting thankfully also feels incredibly weighty (especially Ogre weapons or the bolt pistol and the depth of the new talent trees, coupled with so many new abilities add a lot of depth to the game, especially at higher levels. The missions also feel very distinct visually and whilst there are shared mechanics between some missions they never feel like a copy paste of each other, likely due to the AI director and diverse location themes. Whilst I now feel comfortable recommending Darktide as a very good horde shooter, £50 is a high asking price. I would still recommend picking it up on sale, as you will get much more bang for your buck. Equally, it's a game best enjoyed with friends. I am very excited for the future of Darktide, now that it has found its feet and going by their record I am sure Fatshark will only further enhance this game to be one of the best horde games ever, which it really has the potential to be.;3 October, 2023;

Not marking this game as an early access title is a clear indicator of Fatshark's greed for money. Crafting is still heavily reliant on RNG and its a slog to get a weapon you actually want. They increased the pricing on cosmetics along with ""screwing"" over the PC playerbase by providing way more Aquillas to Xbox players, while the community gets ""insulted"" by a CM for so called ""pearl clutching"".All in all, the game has made more steps forward than back. This is one of the best horde shooter, set in the Warhammer 40k universe. So if you are into that, you might consider a buy.

Warhammer 40,000: Darktide;[FASA];NOT INFORMED;1,748 people found this review helpful33 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 772.4 hrs on record;+++Update, as of Dev Blog: Into the Maelstrom (4th of August, 2023)+++ The long-awaited communication from the developer has clearly revealed that the game will continue it's unfortunate direction. After plentiful feedback in the past months, some major pain-points have been acknowledged, but the announced plans to address them leave much to be desired, or seem outright disrespectful to the dwindling remaining player base. The statements in the original review are still painfully true. While QoL is being added, the updates are few and terribly slow. Poor RNG design decisions are still predominant. New content is still not being presented and there's still no roadmap of any kind. My recommendation stands. Look to purchase it with a discount if interested, and treat it as an investment, for when the developers finally catch-up to it's potential some years down the line. +++Original Review and Recommendations+++I've held off on a review for 6 months after release. I participated in the beta, actively engage in Discord and the forums, clocked in nearly 550 hours, got all achievements and easily play the hardest content currently available. I find the actual gameplay to be unique and personally enjoy it greatly. With that, I don't recommend spending money on this game in its current state. To make it neat and somewhat short: - The game launched in a poor technical state. While a lot of the optimization issues have been addressed there are many more still being reported on the forums. You might be one of the unlucky few. - The advertisements for the game amounted to little truth. What content it did launch with is repetitive and artificially bloated. New content is coming painfully slow and fails to satisfy or impress. - Key selling points to the Live Service model aren't being upheld. The game does get regular updates, the majority of which are fixes and balances, however. New classes haven't been spoken of since launch, a new map was released shortly after launch, with two more coming up, one of which is gated behind a community event. There have been a total of 2 new weapons in 6 months. The rest have been variants of existing items. - The game's design philosophy is heavily dedicated to RNG, with multiple (up to 7-8 in some cases) layers in certain game mechanics. There are extensive threads on the forums about this, if one is interested. - The QoL and respect for the player's time are minimal, if at all present. Mission selection is completely out of the player's hands. QoL improvements are worked on, but there's a lot left to be done. - Community engagement is very poor. FatShark have failed to acknowledge the majority of otherwise often fed back issues. This is in no way due to faults in the community managers, but rather a seemingly anti-consumer corporate policy. - No roadmap has been presented. Initial content planning was quickly reverted after the first backlashes to the game and has not been updated or even spoken of since. - A paid cosmetics shop was launched literally days after release and prior to any immediate patches or gameplay updates. While the cosmetics themselves are hit and miss, they do cost real money to obtain and cannot be obtained via in-game currency. There are cosmetics that can be (and more will be added with the latest Rejects Unite content release), but they are obviously re-skins and of lower quality to the premium store. To sum up my recommendation: Wait. If you have interest in 40K and horde shooters, the game has a wonderful core gameplay loop, but suffers immensely from poor design decisions, lack of content and a dwindling player base. This is historically accurate for FatShark releases, with their previous titles having similar lifespans. As it is now, the game doesn't stand up to scrutiny and doesn't deserve to be purchased at anywhere near full price, let alone further supported with cosmetics purchases.;27 May, 2023;

It has not received the significant updates it deserves, the fixes it desperately needs or any of the attention that a live service demands.Since the beta versions of this game, the community has screamed out about one particular enemy being almost unplayable. It glitches, it's almost impossible to dodge, or avoid. Fatshark's answer to this issue and problem was to MAKE a modifier that INCREASES the amounts those enemies spawn. Then they left that as the ONLY modifier for the past 5 weeks now. Done. Sick of it.They had someone come in over Christmas to switch the real money cash shop over to the next rotation, but not maps, not map modifiers, no fixes, no updates. NOTHING.This is where this game has come to a negative score for me, I have defended it, stood by it, shouted about how much great potential it has.. only to week after week be not only disappointed and let down by the devs, or left frustrated and mad. Anger isn't enough either, it's just utterly piss poor. Fatshark are the WORST developer company I have had the misfortune of being a fan of, I enjoy most of the core gameplay from their games, but almost nothing else. The way they implement the features to a game, is not just backwards, but it is almost always a complete headache, illogical mess that only further disrespects the player. Darktide is a huge factor to that right now, we were promised new maps and modifiers in December, we only got more dogs and a almost mirror reflection of a previous map (Typical Fatshark style here, claiming reverse maps as NEW maps).We were supposed to have a crafting system by the end of December, we don't, even at the end of January.As I write this, a statement was released about making another statement at the end of the week. They said that last week aswell, and as of no surprise, we have no updates or fixes on the day we were told, hey we would have updates and fixes.Darktide has so many faults it's hard to list them all, but some serious ones that can deter any sustainable replay value are :No options to choose your desired map (You must play what is on the board // Hardly rotates)No options to choose modifier (stuck with the weekly, which has been up for weeks now)No full crafting system (You can not forge a weapon, you must buy RNG)Full RNG loot system;19 January, 2023;
Mafia III: Definitive Edition;MPZ;NOT INFORMED;463 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 66.2 hrs on record;"Vehicle damage modelling and virtually non-existent deformation! I mean it has to be a joke right? The first Mafia had about the same level of vehicle deformation 12 freaking years ago! This is quite possibly the most disappointing aspect of this game. We are on ""next-gen"" with all this processing power, etc. and the developer was unable or unwilling to make a proper vehicle damage and deformation system for the open world game that has vehicles as one of its central elements.AI is sub-par as well. The enemy combat AI provides a lackluster challenge even on the hardest setting. Also, it does not respond at all to screaming and running civilians who should be an obvious indication that something fishy is taking place. While the NPCs manage the driving pretty well (except your gun delivery guy or cash collector girl), the pedestrians tend to be completely ignorant to the moving cars and environment around them.Game design. Eliminating the lower level gangsters and racket bosses and doing the wiretaps gets very repetitive really fast. It just lacks variety. I understand it is an open world game, but some memorable scripted missions are always great. The missions to eliminate Olivia and Lou were good. I just feel that Mafia 3 does not quite have the right balance between meaningful open world activities and high quality scripted story-telling.Intrusive HUD. If the aim is to build a nice looking open world, why on earth would you want to break the immersion with ridiculous HUD elements like the GPS ""road signs"" in Mafia 3? It is not quite as intrusive and bad of a solution as Watch Dogs had for its GPS, but it is still pretty darn disturbing. Wouldn't the GTA V-style radar-based navigation be enough?. No option to have multiple saves.Multiple CTDs and obvious bugs within the game world itself (cars driving around with open doors, enemy ragdolls getting stuck in the walls, etc).User interface in menus. Again, due to being a console port. Now to the (great) parts from the previous games that were for some unfortunate reason not included in this one:Enforcement of traffic laws by police. Getting a ticket for speeding or running a red light, made the previous Mafia games feel immersive and set them apart from GTA series. It was a nice way of interacting with the police other than getting shot by them. Back in the days of the first Mafia game, it was a cool innovation that made the player feel that the environment responded to player's actions in a realistic manner. Makes me wonder why the speedometer (another intrusive HUD element) was added to this game at all.Vehicle and clothing based search warrants. It was a nice system of how the police was able to recognize you in 2 different ways once the line of sight was lost. In this edition, you just need to get out of the ""magic"" circle and suddenly there is no interest in your crime anymore.The fuel system, while sometimes tedious, was also a nice element that increased immersion.What I feel this game is missing:More (micro)management of your conquered territories and your own organization and capos. You just give the districts to your capos and that is it! There is so much potential and replay value there that is just ignored. If only you could try to keep hold of your districts and rackets against other aspiring criminals once the main story is done, etc.I understand that Lincoln's story is that of revenge and as such he has little interest in anything else. However, once that story is done and The Marcanos are well six feet under or in the bellies of Bayou crocs, it would be nice to spend that hard earned cash on something other than weaponry (such as properties, cars, clothes, etc.). The side story of any Mafia game ought to be making money and rising up in the world and what is the point of that if there is nothing to spend it on?All in all, Mafia 3 is not a bad game, but unfortunately it is somewhat of a disappointment. Mainly because this game had so much potential, but failed to deliver in many more areas than it got right. It is missing the WOW-factor that the first Mafia game certainly had and that is generally expected from highly marketed open world games and well known franchises of this caliber. It does not excel in any single category and, as such, remains consistent in its mediocrity. The strongest elements of this game are its story-driven campaign and the authentic feel of New Orleans back in the 60s. That it does deliver. Unfortunately, these only get you so far. In spite of the nice open world, it does not seem to have a lot going for it once the story is done. For me, as a hard core fan of the 2 previous Mafia games, it is a definite let-down.";11 October, 2016;

Huge detailed city and great soundtrack add to it quite a bit.- Solid story with great characters and awesome voice acting.- Solid game mechanics - shooting, driving, cover system, etc - all works well, but there's nothing really new about them.Cons:- My biggest gripe with it - it doesn't make you feel like you are mafia- AI is pretty much brain dead. Especially if you are using stealth approach.- Repetitive samey side-quests that are forced onto you as gates to main quests- Poor optimisation (performance-wise this game sucks on most machines, even after a bunch of patches)- Little variety of cars and guns- Lots of things hidden behind unlocks that are too boring to achieve (wanna get that rocket launcher? be ready to do more side quests, if you are not sick from them yet!)- Game has a bunch of pretty meaningless unlocks, instead of giving you fun stuff (e.g. unlock to steal cars quietly, that comes after an ability to call in car delivery)- No fast travel - and since city is big, be ready to spend quite some time traveling aroundAnd in general, the game feels as if they didn't have enough time to finish the game properly.If they'd allow only doing story missions (the most fun part) and beating the game in ~6h or so - it'd be so much better in my opinion. Unfortunately, now you have to fight those boring gate-quests to get to fun stuff. Which is.. well, not fun.I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it at full price.

Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get.

It's easier to empathize with him once you know the trauma he experienced as a child. Also, the little girl Iris in Episode 3 is Gladiolus' little sister and she shows up in the game.5. This takes place the day before Noctis and friends eave Insomnia to embark on their roadtrip. It ends right as they're going to the Citadel to meet King Regis (the opening scene of the game). I liked how it developed Noctis and Ignis' relationship a bit more, especially when Ignis recalls how Noctis' injury changed him. I presume this is the injury from the daemon in the Brotherhood anime. I believe that same injury is the one Noctis was still recovering from in the prologue of the Kingsglaive movie. This might help you understand Lunafreya's special place in Noctis' heart. At just 8 years old Noctis witnessed the death of his caretaker at the hands of a daemon and is himself injured. Presumably he is still recovering from this injury when he meets Lunafreya as a child in Tenebrae, which Noctis constantly has flashbacks to in the game. To meet someone so pure and loving like Lunafreya not long after his dark, traumatic experience with the daemon must have left a strong impression on him, building a strong emotional attachment for him to Lunafreya.6. Have fun. You might have heard that the sidequests are really unabashedly bad and of no consequence to the world/plot (unlike games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3). It's quite a shame because it's a such a missed opportunity, given how beautiful the Open World is to roam about in. SquareEnix probably just ran out of time or resources, and admittedly churning out well-written side-quests is probably the least of the concerns given the long development hell the game went through. Nevertheless, just take the sidequests and hunts as excuses for you to spend time with Noctis and his buddies. The more you develop an attachment to the 4 of them, the better the emotional payoff towards the end of the game and in the DLC.7. This DLC is about Gladiolus trying to get stronger so he can better protect Noctis. Not really much story development, but the combat is more skill-based and probably an interesting experiment on SquareEnix's part. If you like Gladioulus' combat style, you can unlock the ability to play him in the main game by spending AP in the main game's Ascension menu (it's under the Techniques tab). You can do this even before you play the DLC actually, but the DLC trains you better. If you finish the DLC it unlocks a new weapon (both Gladiolus and Noctis can use it) and ability for Gladiolus that carries over to the main game.8. The Open World is about to close off lore-wise soon. You can still play the Open World segment in the later chapters, but it's not lore-friendly because Noctis and his buddies are about to embark on a journey that leaves behind the Open World. You access the Open World through pretty much a game mechanic later on. I spent over 70 hours on the Open World before I finally moved on in Chapter 9. Think of it as time for you to develop your love for the main characters. The emotional impact of the linear Chapters 9-14 depend on this9. (See previous point)10. Enjoy the story!11.

Hairworks is the most lightweight one though (costs about 2fps) and looks amazing so I kept that one on.2) The High-Resolution Pack works great on a GTX 1070 (on 1440p res), even though it lists minimum requirements as being a GTX 1080 Ti, and I recommend you get it if you run a resolution greater than 1080p, have a GPU with 8GBs of VRAM, and have the extra 65GBs of space for it.3) If you have performance issues remember to update your drivers. Both Nvidia and AMD have new drivers that include optimization for this game.4) IMPORTANT EDIT: I originally had a guide here on how to edit the .ini file to support a 144hz monitor. After playing a little longer I noticed some bugs I was having such as long black screens before loading and hunt posters staying on screen after turning the quests in. Turns out this was due to editing the .ini file. Please reset your .ini file if you are having issues after editing it from my guide or another. Edits other than framerate can cause similar issues too. I recommend leaving the file alone for now.5) The options you get when booting up the game ""Television"" or ""Home Theater"" don't affect your display, they actually affect your audio. It also had nothing to do with stereo or surround sound. It determines audio compression. If you are using low quality speakers select ""Television"" as it will sound better for you. Otherwise choose ""Home Theater"".Note: I know many are reporting random CTDs or frame drops but I haven't experienced a single CTD and the game runs smooth as butter for me staying between 50-60 fps even when encountering large enemies (i7-4790k, GTX 1070, 16GB 2133 DDR3 RAM, SSD).Game Review:PC Support - 9/10Performance - 9/10Graphics - 9/10Sound - 8/10Music - 8/10Story - 9/10Gameplay - 7/10Multiplayer - 4/10 (mostly dead by the time I got to it)Things I like:Story was great and the main crew are some of the most unforgettable characters in gaming.The setting is a mix of high fantasy and steampunk but where some characters just look like normal people driving cars and stuff.The summons and giant creatures you sometimes encounter are epic. Imagine fighting a boss the size of a mountain... so big the camera doesn't even function correctly.You're driving a luxury vehicle that transforms several times throughout the game.Whole game is very stylish.Things I don't like:The story won't hit like it should unless you experience the other accompanying FFXV media first such as Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV and Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV. While not as important it might even be worth it to play A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV and watch the Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV on YouTube.Episode Ardyn isn't included in this edition and it's the best DLC content.Side quests are some of the most boring unmemorable side content I've played through, reminds me of MMO fetch quests with no real story involved. I recommend skipping them even if you are a completionist.The high level challenge dungeons are just seemingly endless copy and paste floors of enemies, don't bother with these either.Unlike others I don't have a problem with the combat, I have a problem with the difficulty. The game is way too easy since you can just buy and carry ridiculous amounts of healing items. I later found out there is an easy mode but not hard mode which is just absurd. Definitely play with the hard mode mod from the Nexus even if it's your first time playing.The brainless minigame ""Justice Monsters Five"" is way too easy and therefore way too long and boring however if you play it long enough you can get some great items from it at the beginning of the game.";7 March, 2018;

If you wish to dive into the game without knowing any sort of pacing-related topics in terms of the game's story, do not read ahead. or just skip the next paragraph. However, I do not give out any specific spoilers, so rest assure.[STORY]Now, after beating the main story for myself, I will say one very important thing about the pacing of the story: the chapters feel very rushed toward the end, and it felt like each few sections of chapters within the game were developed, or written, by different people, Not to mention the numerous plot holes that were in each chapter, especially towards the end of the game. It goes from semi-dynamic gameplay to dynamic, and then to linear, which is absolutely disappointing. During the dynamic portion of the game, you can start and finish many side-quests, dungeons, or just power level via fighting monsters and bosses. Then, when you decide to progress through the story, about three-fourths of the way through progression, the game just decides to throw you into a linear structure of gameplay, which you will notice after about five minutes of playing through it. To conclude the topic of the game's story, let me say that it started it out pretty well, then escalated into something worse, but manageable if you don't think too critically about the plot holes, or why they developers decided to do what they did.Nonetheless, I still loved the characters, especially the main four and their small interactions during the open-world sequences.[DLC]So, at long last, I have finished all three DLC's. My experiences with Episode Gladiolus and Prompto differ from Episode Ignis. I didn't dislike any of the DLC's. however, I thoroughly enjoyed Episode Ignis a lot more not just because of the better combat mechanics, but because the story from the full-game is actually redeemed in a way through playing this DLC. The way they handled this DLC was pretty genius, and if you play through it, you might think the same. I can't say why exactly without giving out spoilers, so I'll stop talking about Ep. Ignis here. Each time the three DLC's were released, they got better and better. Episode Glad was a bit weak in terms of content, but explained what happened during a certain part of the main-game's story. Episode Prompto was very good in developing Prompto's character, but was weak in gameplay. There were moments during combat where I was getting a bit frustrated with how weak I was against the enemies. The mechanics were cool, but it felt like I was playing a third-person shooter made by Ubisoft.My overall thoughts on all three DLC's: They were very good in terms of story and character development. some could use tweaking in gameplay mechanics. and beating each DLC can give you extra items/weapons/fashion in the main game which is a plus. Although they felt weak at times, I liked all three of the DLC's. I believe they added onto the main game's story plot points quite a bit, which makes them more than worth playing.[GAMEPLAY]{Played this game with a Playstation 3 controller}I will try to keep this short and start off by saying that the gameplay is amazing! No, the combat is not turn-based, although you can enable the ""Wait"" combat function in the options at any time, which gives you a slight feel of the combat being turn-based. I decided to play without it, and I had a blast. My only gripe about the combat is that you can't freely use magic. You have to create it by absorbing three types of elements: electricity, fire, and ice. With these three, you can create a spell, which usually comes in a stock of x3 or x4. Furthermore, you can add a fourth item from your inventory which gives the spell more potency and effects. It's not so bad once you get used to it, but I still do wish you can use White Magick or Black Magick like in the older games. [VISUALS]Another disclaimer: This is a budget gaming PC I created in 2015. so yes, it is on the low-mid end tier. CPU: Intel i5-3570k (3.4ghz, NOT OC'd)GPU: Gigabyte GTX 960 2GBRAM: 8 GB DDR3DISK: Game installed on Samsung 850 EVO SSD 250 GBOS: Windows 7 64-BitOkay, so after testing various graphics settings via playing the demo before the full-game release, I ended up playing the majority of the full-game in the ""High"" setting with the scaling set to 100%. As many of you would expect with my specs, I did end up with a few problems here and there. After beating certain parts of the main story, I would end up running into a cutscene with about 10-20 frames running, even after the cutscene ended. So, I would be playing at the said frames unless I restarted my game. The same problem would sometimes happen after I perform a summon. Because of this, towards the end of the game, I switched to the ""Average"" graphics setting and I was mostly fine from there. There was one immersion-breaking moment that happened in a certain cutscene during the final hour or two of the game, where Noctis was invisible, but it was a rather short and less-important cutscene, so I was okay with it.On the ""Average"" settings, I was getting about 45-60 frames with a few dips here and there, but I did end up beating the game without the frames ever being locked to 30. So here's a tip from me: play this game with a graphics card with more VRAM than me. or just have a better machine than mine, which I'm sure is the case for many of you. I just thought I would add this section for the few that have rigs similar to mine. Final note, don't enable the last four ""NVIDIA"" graphics settings because those destroy your frames, even if you have an a slightly better setup than mine.[LOADING SCREENS]Okay. So, If you've played this game on a console after the initial release in 2016, you know how excruciatingly long the loading screens were. If you install this game on a standard HDD, you will get the same effects. However, if you install on an SSD, the longest you will have to wait is about 30 seconds. The average time it took for me to sit through the load screens was about 3 to 15 seconds. That's it.So try to install on an SSD if you have one. I moved a few of my steam games over to my 4TB HDD, just to install this and it was worth it. [As of 03/10/2018] On my end, this game is about 83.3 GB's, so maybe use that as reference to find some space.[VOICE ACTING]I don't mean to start a war over ""Sub vs. Dub"". I appreciate both languages.As a Japanese-American who fluently speaks and comprehends both the English and Japanese language, I played the entire game in Japanese, with English subtitles. Thank you Square Enix for adding that function to almost all of your newer games! I have watched a few Twitch streamers and YouTubers play the game in English, and I have to say both are very good. However, there were very key differences in the acting. Once again, let me state that I am not being biased because I'm Japanese. I believe I have a pretty good understanding of the level voice acting displayed on both sides of the spectrum. Now, my thoughts are that some of the characters' voices in English are a bit jarring at times. Since writing some of my specific critiques on the voices would end up riling some of you, I will avoid in doing so. However, I will say that the Japanese voices fit perfectly, and I had no problems at all.It was interesting, though, to hear Cindy talk in Japanese. In English, she has that southern accent, but in Japanese, she just speaks using standard Tokyo dialect. No complaints though. Also, the localization of this game made it so the subtitles are following the English voices, not Japanese. So if you play with Japanese voices, know that not all dialogue is the literal translations. Steam's character limit is preventing me from so much more explanation, unfortunately. Sorry.Edit [03/20/18]:- Added review of the DLC's- Cleaned up and fixed points in review- Removed review's ""Conclusion""";10 March, 2018;

On one hand, it is such a flawed game. flawed in its core fundamentals - empty open world, middling and slightly repetitive side quests, weak narrative structure (can i just say, i adore the FFXV lore? why is it not in the game???). but somehow, all these things become bearable because i have the company of 3 extremely lovable, adorable, and memorable companions/party members. i will slog through endless walking in a barren field to kill 5 enemies because i want to hear noctis mistake prompto for ignis during their linkstrikes. i'll drive (also known as the most boring way to traverse an open world i've ever known) just to do prompto's lil photo spot side quests. i'll cook in campsites so gladio can have his cup noodles.

All of this combined really takes the fun out of the game.At this moment i highly recommend against buying this game. (And still do)If you are absolutely set on wanting to buy this, then listen up. Here's what you need to do: At the start go for the supermoto and do the first supermoto event you can see. If you can ride all of those tracks it probably means you don't have the problem that your game will crash on certain tracks (2 supermoto tracks are part of that list). If your game does crash, i strongly recommend refunding it. Why did you not refund it? Well because i already played it for too long trying to figure out why it kept crashing thinking it was a problem with my pc. There wasen't a known list of tracks that were known to crash your game when i bought it.I put in a report of all this on their official website and they responded, so lets hope they will fix these things soon. (They didn't)They had an update where they fixed some issues, but the track crashes are still there and so is the terrible AI. Just so you know.

I have played this game elsewhere so ignore the 15hrs game time on the steam platform but thats another story for another time.As a whole the game is very good, i really do like it. theres a ton of bikes to buy and unlock along with the performance upgrades. theres also enough tracks in the game to keep anyone happy. there are also a few stinkers too.... take Macau in China as a good example. its incredibly narrow and full of nasty sharp corners, there really is a place reserved in Hell for the person that put that track into Ride III.Graphically Ride III is beautiful, the bike models are really stunning and the game is very nicely optimised. i only have a GTX1060 6Gb and i have no issues with FPS on max settings. There regular races to compete in along with time attacks and drag racing, so a nice variety.There are however a few issues. as is synonymous with the RIDE franchise the bike sounds leave a lot to be desired. the 2 stroke bikes sound like you might expect......(here comes the over-used phrase) they sound like an angry wasp in a jam jar. some bikes dont sound ""too bad"" but they could be much much better. some bikes sound truly awful, take the Triumph Triple for example. there are no words that i possess in my vocabulary to explain or compare to what this sounds like. its absolutely awful to the point i wouldnt even say that it sounds like any bike ive ever heard, it doesnt even sound like it could be a bike. After 3 series of RIDE i would like to think they would have got on top of the sound issues, but they havent, so thats that.The second issue i want to mention is the A.I or lack of it. yes, there are computer controlled rivals but they have no intelligence to speak of. They seem to just follow the same lines over and over. They never make mistakes, they never fall off or have accidents with each other. but the biggest problem of all is that they seem to have no concept of you being there. they wont defend the corners at all and they are all too easy to pass. having said that, should you hit one by mistake they seem to be an unmovable object. you are the only one thats gonna fall off, and its the same vice versa.... if they hit you because youve made a mistake then yet again, youll be the one who suffers. i would just say the other riders are more obstacles rather than any kind of A.I which is a shame.onto the bikes themselves. each bike definately feels different to another. take a CBR600RR and a GSXR600 from the same era. the GSXR feels smooth, civilised and planted. the CBR on the other hand feels sharper in the corners with better brakes, but it isnt as quick. the brakes on the CBR are better but the back end really squirms around under heavy braking where as the GSXR seems planted. The CBR has had me off due to the rear end squirm. each bike in the game is a totally different kettle of fish which is a massive good point for the game. it makes you want to test every bike!!final verdict? is it worth a buy? sure it is. overall its an enjoyable game and its a good game, theres plenty to do in the career mode to keep anyone happy for many many hours!could the game be better? Yes, and thats a big yes, the only 2 things that let it down and let it down badly are the god awful bike sounds and the horrendous A.I or lack of.";2 July, 2020;

The handling of the bikes has no correlation to real bikes at all, there is only leaning but no steering impluses. Everything feels heavy and every steering interaction is just too late (since there is no steering). Whatever skill-level of riding you are in real life, i can guarentee this is not transferable to this game. It just feels alienated and strange.

The AI.The AI is pure dogs**t. Honestly it feels like they're following the most basic path following algorithm, their ONLY goal is stay on the racing line, not matter the weather, camber of the corner, or even if YOU are right there. I would be embarrased to release a game with this kind of crap in it. It's so bad at the point that even though I would like the challenge of 120% AI, its actually MORE fun to play at 100% and just leave them all behind so they don't ruin your fun or immersion. This problem gets magnified in the wet weather. On bigger bikes (especially at tracks like Portimao or Algarve if you prefer) the AI will consistently highside out of corners BUT stay on as if nothing has happened AND power out of the corner as if they have lost no grip. The physics of the game in general feel good but what does that matter if the AI seem to have COMPLETELY different physics that only apply to them, just to allow them to keep up with you (unfairly)?This monumental flaw can only try to cover up the other things that make this game so painful.For example: Rear tyre grip seems to be extremely sporadic, the Suzuki K5 has a very lively rear wheel (which is good since it had no TCS), but then other big bikes with ????????? of torque have 100% grip permanentlyExhaust pipes fly at 90 degree angles from the bike and dont stay in place or sometimes DON'T EVEN EXIST!AI riders legs hang off on the straights for no reasonAI don't even acknowledge you on the track, constantly ramming you or just forcing you to lose time.I mean seriously what the actual ????.I'm only going to continue to play so that I can unlock all the bikes I like and then NEVER play against AI ever again and only against my friends.If there are fixes coming (probably not since its Milestone), I will change my review.There are some decent things about the game, like i said the feel of the physics, the suspension generally feels good and the bikes sounds and models are brilliant...;6 December, 2018;

In my time playing, I have:-Been surprised there was even a Story Mode & vs. A.I. options.-Gotten completely obliterated in PvP to the point of feeling so helpless I may as well just stand still.-Raged so hard my neighbor called to see if I was okay.-Have had my wounds salted constantly by terrible server stability and bad matchmaking rolls.-Cooled my head and gathered advice from Veteran players. realizing a lot of what I was doing was wrong.-Discovering that mastering the art of Parry is what makes the game a lot easier.-Learned that playing an unfamiliar character without practicing its movesets in Training is an awful idea.-Realized that while some characters have meta strategies, there's always a window of opportunity to get out of it (e.g. Cent Cutscene.)-Found out the reason most complain about OP/Imbalance is because they don't take the time to learn how to handle characters. especially new characters.-Exclusively plays PvP after beating the Story Mode and Warrior Trials.-Understand that this game is very VERY reflex dependent.-Has gone 1v4 with both teams breaking, 3 of my teammates dead and yelling at me, and I won with barely any HP left as their yells then turn to praise.-Tirelessly strive to get better at characters I liked.-Is now capable of destroying Rep 100+ so long as I keep my focus.-Playing while drunk is both stupid and great at the same time I've yet to decide if it's a good or bad idea.-Understand ""off days"" will happen where I just can't find a groove and my reaction times are dead. it happens to everyone.This is one of those games where, even if you go into it with a cool head, even if you say you don't get upset by games. something stupid will happen that's 100% out of your control, and it will piss you off. But then, you have so much fun with the gameplay/theme itself, you just keep coming back for more.If you're on the fence about buying this game and find yourself wary from the Mixed reviews? Just give it a shot, come to your own judgment, but I'll tell you right now. don't give up if you get destroyed. People think this game is easy, but it's not. You can't win just by picking Oroachi and spamming Light attacks. It might work for a bit, but you WILL find someone who knows how to deal with that, and you WILL be made helpless with your one-trick strategy. Branch out!FOR HONOR is a game about learning your character(s), and then learning how to deal with other characters as your character. Attack speeds, delays, punishments, mobility, counters. there's a lot that are factored in, and the system is a lot more intricate than it seems.Sure, matchmaking and server stability may be frustrating, but unless you have horrible luck, it's doesn't stay that way forever. Sometimes stepping back from the game to breathe is a good idea, sometimes going into VS A.I. for a bit (or for some Orders) will ease the stress. But keep with it. let loss be your fuel, have shortcomings enable your strive for greatness.DON'T get pissed at your teammates, just because you're hit doesn't mean it was on purpose. Just because they're not near you, doesn't mean they're not being helpful. Look at yourself and see what YOU could have did better. to stay by them, or to better survive when solo.Above all, have a good time.Metas come and go, server issues aren't being ignored by Ubi (which is why they do maintenance.)I played Valkyrie pre-rework and still kicked ass in PvP once I learned her, as tough as it was, because 'weakness' is only a perspective. Now post-rework? I can be pretty scary with her. I'm not infallible, I'm not ""the best"", but I hope you understand what I'm getting at.You keep at something long enough with a willingness to learn? You will go far in this game.";8 April, 2019;
FOR HONOR™;Shape;1,183 products in account;1,204 people found this review helpful22 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 416.5 hrs on record;"Edit: If you've stumbled upon this review somehow, know that most of these complaints have actually been fixed or otherwise addressed and this is not really accurate anymore. I honestly want very much to be able to recommend For Honor. The core gameplay is absolutely unique, taking the spirit of the fighting genre and turning it into something new and exciting. It's smooth, intuitive, heart-pounding action with the depth to keep you constantly learning and improving and getting better. And when it all comes together, it feels amazing. Not to mention how astonishingly beautiful the animations are. We as gamers tend to gloss over games having unrealistic animations so it's truly mind-blowing when you sit there and realize just how incredibly realistic your characters move around in For Honor no matter what they're doing. But the heart of this game is tainted. Tainted by greed. And it truly does ruin an otherwise fantastic game. Now to start, For Honor has an in-game currency called ""Steel"". You get Steel by playing the campaign, or doing daily ""orders"", and you even get a little after every match. And this would be all well and good if Steel was just for buying cosmetics. It would be a nice progression system to keep you playing and drip feed you extras as a reward. But no, that's not where this story ends. Because this game also has another very important progression system: gear.And gear is not just cosmetic. Gear has stats. And this gear can have a lot of stats. The difference between a fresh character (0) and a fully upgraded set of gear (108) is nothing short of downright unfair. When you first start out, you'll be playing against other players playing the same exact hero you are but hitting twice as hard, taking half damage, using almost no stamina, getting revenge four times as fast, or many other numerous advantages depending on what stats they invested in. You can win if you're the better player, sure, but you have to be a MUCH better player.So this system in concept is not terrible. It allows you to choose strengths and weaknesses for your hero to fit your playstyle. That's great! But the problem is that getting maxed gear is a massive, massive grind. It took me roughly 70 hours of gameplay to finally fully outfit one single hero in 108 gear. Does that sound bad? Well that's still not it. Gear is divided into 3 rarities: grey, blue, and purple. So if you want to accelerate your gear grind, you might figure that you'll just blow all your Steel on gear crates until you get a full purple set, and then start upgrading. Seems like a solid plan, right? But whoops, purple gear can't drop until you're Reputation level 3 or higher with your hero, and this information is NEVER PRESENTED IN GAME. So in effect, trying to buy gear crates before you're Reputation 3 with a hero is a complete and utter waste of Steel, and you have no way of knowing this unless you read guides or other community resources. And here's the real kicker: the matchmaker literally doesn't consider your gearscore when making a match. Ubisoft fully intended for brand new players to be getting put up against maxed out players. So if you were thinking ""well if I just get matched with people who have similar gearscore to me, this doesn't sound so bad"", consider your totally reasonable dreams crushed. Because if you haven't guessed by now, Steel can also be bought with real money. Ah, now see with that in mind, all this seemingly senseless game design suddenly starts making a very sinister kind of sense. Why con people out of Steel by intentionally providing only vague descriptions of how loot works? To get them to buy more! Why have a matchmaker that regularly puts together extremely imbalanced, one-sided matches? So that players get frustrated that they don't have good gear and potentially spend money on Steel to accelerate their gear grind! Why lock purple gear behind Reputation levels, anyway? To get people to spend money on Steel to spend on Champion Status so that they can grind Reputation levels faster!And that's how they see For Honor. They see it as a way to milk money out of you. This is easily one of the most innovative and fresh competitive multiplayer games of recent years, but Ubisoft has mutilated and perverted it into the sick and twisted cash cow that now stands before you. I am truly heartbroken at what could have been, and I can only hope that with enough critical feedback, eventually Ubisoft will give For Honor the respect it deserves as a video game and not as a psychologically manipulative microtransaction machine.";28 April, 2017;

All of the content from this game, all levels and characters etc, are part of Left 4 Dead 2 by default. This means buying this one is redundant. Just save the money and buy the sequel so you can play them both at the same time plus have the added benefit of the new monsters you get to fight from the sequel.~~~~~~~~~2019 EDIT:After countless people explaining the differences between the games, do yourself a favor and research these two great titles. I am sure there is a video out there showcasing how they are different. I personally feel that this game is redundant however many disagree and would rather play the original content on the original game only, not on Left 4 Dead 2. You should figure out which is best for you before buying.With that being said, keep in mind these games are getting old and frequently go on sale for dirt cheap prices. I think you can sometimes even get both Left 4 Dead titles for about $5 total which is worth it. Then you can install and play both and decide for yourself. All that matters is that they get played because they are terrific and shouldn't be forgotten.~~~~~~~~~Review:As for the game itself, I highly recommend this title. This is teamwork at its best. You literally can't get through this game by yourself. Sure, you can play single player mode just fine since the AI is decent but I mean you can't play ALONE as the game will inevitably put you into certain scenarios where you will get pinned down and die without someone there to save you. So either another player or an AI will have to help you up or it's game over.The gunplay is fast and furious. The zombies are fast and attack in hordes so you can't really survive long by standing in one place.There isn't too much story but with this type of game you really don't need story. Just fight your way from one obstacle to the next until you finish the game. Terrific good time.;18 June, 2017;

And only 4 hearts of survivors, who beat in the rhythm of life, are able to break through this dead cold world, into that cherished cozy house, where there is safety and the illusion of a better world, which is somewhere there ...I must say that each of these four hearts has its own character and style, so who would you choose from the main characters in coop-game with friends, you will still feel the unique style of each character, which does not affect the balance, but fills this world of the cold dead with notes of something alive and warm. And the world around you is truly awful, and no matter what company (history) you run, you will feel that everything around you is filled with cold and a sense of hopelessness ...WARNING :) Immersion in the game occurs instantly, almost from the first minutes of the gameplay, and great music complements this well. If you play this game with the lights off, in the dark, before going to bed, then fear the terrible zombie - nightmares that will come to you with a cold in the night!The game has several company histories, each of which has several missions - locations where you will need to reach your coveted shelter house and stay alive. At the same time, of course :) you also need to remember to take the cartridges and save kits. If you think that passing each mission will be a boring task, according to the principle: to go from point A to point B, then you are mistaken! After all, apart from the usual zombies, especially infected ones are waiting for you. Terrible tension and cold sweat on the back - after all, even the simple problem of finding canisters and pouring them into the generator can make you die more than once! Well, and talk about those moments when you have to wait for the door to open, and with horror shoot crowds of zombies, which like avalanches fall upon the entire team of survivors again and again. It’s good to have a friend or friends (coop-game for 4 players) that will help you in difficult times and will make a company in this world, the cold world of mankind’s hopes of salvation, and only survival can save us all from the virus that penetrates into those seconds in the brains of those whom you loved and knew, those who were close to you and dear to you, but they are all already sick with a virus, and only lead can calm them forever!10 \ 10 living hearts in the world of the dead.;8 April, 2019;

I've given it about 60 hours so far so that I could get familiar with it's quirks, its yays and its nays...while i'm still having lots of fun, there are many issues that need to be resolved if the game is to be successful. I'll try to update this review as patches, hopefully, come out.https://youtu.be/_TtkodH8dwEUpdate 4/15/18- Spinning green please wait circle seems to have been fixed.- Many of the bugs involving client crashes and stuck lobbies seems to have been fixed.- Disconects are still a thing but they don't seem to happen as often as before.-Tuff blocks are still an issue, but they reset much faster now. Would be best if they were much harder to topple over.The good ______________________________- Amazing visuals - Tracks are beautifully rendered and the scaling is a lot closer to normal levels, bike and rider look crisp and detailed.- Milestone did a great job capturing the statium enviroment, with lots of animated trackworkers and camera crews about. A very nice touch and adds a great deal of immersion!- Sounds - I actually really like the sounds here - the bike sounds very relavent to engine load. My only complaint in this dept is that I wish the crowd reacted more to the racing and that some of the announcer sounds were louder even if it is gibberish.- Those corners! Love the way cornering and ground controls work with all the assists off. The way the bike slides and hooks up are very engaging. Milestone has a strong ground game.- Performance - Playing on a 6700k and GTX 1070, this game performs flawlessly. Quick loadtimes, no hiccups. Solid FPS.- Having Qualifying and heats with friends is surprisingly fun - trying to push the pace and fight through the drama of having a bad qualifying session or heat race. Then there are the little details like getting the red plate on your bike if you are the points leader / are the most consistant in a lobby which is a really touch.- Different times of day - Time attack, Qualifying,;21 February, 2018;

Ai Riders seem impossible to race, youll often find yourself punted off track, or crash as the ai riders do not slow down if you cut in front of them or bump them in a corner, it makes for a racing experience similar to that of a dodgem car ride at a theme park. The only way youll get past them is if you gently bump them and ride off, through some miracle.The track editor is fairly well executed considering this is a somewhat new concept in modern mx games, it is simple to use, has many options for stadium shapes and sizes, and makes for a pleasant track building experience. The choice of track pieces seems somewhat limited however, and once you complete your loop, going back and editing sections after intial testing can be rather tedious, and confusing to make work. Overall, for the common consumer, this game ticks all the boxes, however for motocross racing game veterans, this is very much a case of a game that had so much potential, but misses the mark enough to be unforgiving.;14 February, 2018;

The physics feel great, many people complain, but really, they feel good (Feel similar to MXGP not sure why everyone is complaining) However, the whips still need work it still feels like you have no control over the whip at all and is really hard to pull off without landing sideways or not landing it at all #FREETHEWHIP. The AI are absolutely stupid, they constantly crash into tough blocks and case every single rhythm section and are really really slow (Have them on realistic Manual Physics etc. and still smoke them by 10sec+). The game still feels like it’s in beta with the amount of small bugs that its littered with, like why am I able to ride a 450 in the 250 class and why can’t I change back? Why are the boots covered in dirt in the customize screen? Why does the menu break? Why do AI spawn on top of each other in the gate? They have taken a major step backwards with the career, You are stuck with the sponser graphics kit that look like absolut ???? and you are unable to change back to the factory graphics or what you had equipped, You don’t even get respect or offers to join factory teams, probably the most annoying feature about the game. (They did a great job with it in MXGP). The 250s feel like they have no power, you case every single supercross triple and struggle to even complete a rhythm section without casing jumps (I understand they aren’t as fast as the 450s but last time I checked they raced on the same track and don’t double a supercross triple). There is also no punishment for casing jumps, why? It is faster for me to case every single jump in a section then to double it all the way through, where is the ??????? logic in that? Don’t even think about buying the DLCs they are garbage and you get like 3 skins for $4. As many negatives as there are the game still feels pretty good, multiplayer battle are amazing with friends as you can block pass and square corners up really well. The overrall gameplay feels alot smoother and better than MXGP just too many bug and small fixes that need to be made.;14 February, 2018;

In my opinion, this is Milestone's best dirt bike game yet. I loved MXGP and MXGP2, and I bought MXGP3 a couple of months ago. I was very disappointed in MXGP3 because of the physics. They felt bland and you couldn't slide the bike at all like in MXGP2. In this game, they fixed that and made the physics even better. The grip is as close to perfect as I've felt, and you really get a good feeling when the bike hooks up in a corner. You can slide into corners with ease, and it feels great. I absolutely love stadium racing compared to MXGP tracks, stadium tracks require you to really learn the course to get every section perfect. I'm still getting used to the whip physics, it is very different from past games. The bike customization is great, but pretty similar to past games. The new additions are very welcome though, such as adjusting your numbers on the bike. I do wish there were more graphic kits, but there is enough. Everything from past games is customizable.The game runs fine on ultra settings on an i7 6700k, GTX 1080ti, and 16GB RAM. I have noticed frame drops at the beginning of races in the daytime, but it goes away after a few seconds.I have noticed that the crashes are a little bugged, I have been flung off the bike halfway across the stadium multiple times when I fall. While it is funny, I hope it gets patched.EDIT: Okay, so I tried the track editor. It's pretty cool. I really like all the modules, but I wish you could add trackside objects too.The AI is pretty good, and very competitive. Things can get hectic at the start of a race because everyone is in close proximity, but I was expecting this.So far, I am enjoying this game quite a bit. The physics really do make it feel so much better than MXGP3. I recommend this game.;13 February, 2018;

MotoGP™18;Inspiral;4,969 products in account;46 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 26.0 hrs on record;I've played all the MotoGP games from MotoGP 13 onwards. I'm a big fan. When Milestone announced the shift to the Unreal Engine for MotoGP 18 I was worried there'd be loads of teething problems, but cheered by the fact that Milestone would release a few other titles first. Hopefully they'd iron out any wrinkles before working on the MotoGP franchise. By March 2018, the Milestone devs were blogging that the new engine was enabling them to make quantum leaps in terms of graphics, bike handling and crash damage/tyre wear. I became excited, and preordered. I really should have known better.Forget Milestone's claims about quantum leaps, this is a copy-and-paste job. It's MotoGP 17 with oversensitive controls and less content than any of the previous MotoGP games (not counting the stripped down 'Compact' versions, obviously). The damage system is simply scratches on the bodywork. And you get the same cosmetic damage regardless of whether you topple over at walking pace, bump a competitor, or cartwheel through a sandtrap at 200mph. So what's the point of that? And the Ai is inferior, riding around like they're on rails and taking slow turns way better than you can but going slower in medium to fast bends so you can still win even on harder settings. Seriously, what is the point?It does have one pro to offset the cons - the tracks have apparently been laser-scanned and are more accurate now. Oh, and we have a new track in Thailand. But that's it. There's no historic challenges with all the extra tracks and bikes they brought with them, no splitscreen, and while there's still time trial it's made awful by a stupidly harsh system that invalidates your lap if you touch a kerb. To summarise, I can't recommend MGP18 when the previous carnations are cheaper, give you more content (way more in the case of Valentino Rossi the Game, which is MotoGP 16 in all but name), and actually handle better. None of the MGP games are perfect, but this feels downright rushed.;31 July, 2018;

MotoGP™18;4lien;NOT INFORMED;22 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 9.7 hrs on record;"This is the first MotoGP game I've played so I can't really compare this to previous versions of the game.ControlsThe controls are not that easy if you're first starting out but I noticed that you'll get the hang of it pretty fast.GraphicsIt's not super realistic but totally okay in my opinion. The only thing that bugs me a little is weather effects. If it rains you have these little rain drop effects on the screen and I couldn't figure out how to disable them yet. Maybe it's possible. Anyway you'll get used to it eventually.SoundI've seen people complain about the engine sound not loud/clear enough. This is true in some cases. Surrounding sounds are pretty loud and might distract you from your own engine noise. If you want to play with manual shifting this might be a bad thing for you. Other than that I really like the sound design.Gameplay/AIThe overall gameplay is really fun! Career mode looks also solid to me. I had to change the difficulty of the AI a bit to match my ""skill level"". 50% was still too hard for me, noob alert. I noticed that the AI doesn't give a ???? about you, which is probably the worst about this game. It's like you're not there, they don't care about you. This resulted in many crashes for me so I had to adjust the difficulty a bit. Made it better for me. I try to up this on the fly, while getting better.PriceToo high. The game looks good and works fine but the price is still too high imo. I think a max of 30,- would be better. Maybe even less. There's a lot of potential that is still unused, so it simply doesn't justify 50,-.I can see why other players might want to stick to previous versions if they liked them better but for me as a first time player of MotoGP, this is great. Maybe a little expensive but still worth it.";29 June, 2018;

I moaned about them all the way to 20172018 is a jump in the right direction. There are some bugs, and its a few days after release on a new engine. But they fixed the Time Trial mode and the graphics are superbI am a big fan of 2018 and if Ride3 will be based on this same engine (as is confirmed) then this game is a good indication that Ride3 will be the game for me!!!!! Enjoying 2018 and the physics. Bike setup means so much more now!!!! However with the Physics, as you level up the rider gets easier and the physics are less of an issue, physics only feel good when your rider has no skill. As he gets better the game gets easier and the physics become more arcade likeImprovments everywhere, this isnt just better graphicsThey cut out alot of the rubbish people didnt want in 2017 and 2016 and focused on the racing and the commentary etc and the atmosphere. Big yellow flares at Mugello. Its feels like your there. Rain mode looks fantasticOne thing missing.... An optional background racing music. But I guess Spotify sorts that out anyway and to my taste.Make sure you buy this and Ride 3 (Delete the rest)I will note I set a time and it uploaded to milestone services a few hours ago. At the time of writing my game will not view leader boards. I verified my files and now I dont appear to be on the leader boards at all. Very annoyed as I was 3rd fastest in JerezShame this isnt cross platform like Street Fighter 5 is using the same unreal engine (PC vs PS4)While to me its the best motogp game, i cant recommend it as milestone failed to listen to the fans once againDont be fooled, there are many areas improved, but can i recommend it?

MotoGP™18;MonsterDodgers;213 products in account;12 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 42.4 hrs on record;A new engine, the big disapointment.The first Unreal Engine use of the series. Farewell to their long time used in-house engine but is it really a big improvement?Nah.The advantage of using Unreal Engine for this game is that the environment effect became very decent.I still remember that Milestone's own engine had very poor weather effect. Everything looked like some kinda toys.Thanks to UE4, the weather effects are not only just look good, but also have some variety such as fog.But you know what? In terms of graphics, that's the only improvement of 18 over 17.The graphics, my gosh. Everything looks blurry. This stupid blur ruins whole damn graphics.Blur is too much so the game looks like it's came out in 2013 or something. Every single object has to look clear, every single tree in the distance also has to look clear. But in MotoGP 18, everything looks not clear even in the short distance.I can't tell about the textures exactly, but judging from in game and horrible replay, every single things look low-res like PS3 games. It's really strange that their Monster Energy Supercross game also had blurry graphics but could see the textures are hi-res and look very clear. I don't know if they rushed MotoGP 18 or not, but one thing is clear that this is not even close to 2018 graphics.Physics feels better at this time. You end up crash when you push the brake too hard on a corner. Also, gotta manage body position when accelerating to prevent wheelie. Of course, you had to do the same in previous series but this time the bikes feel more powerful and easy to fall than before. Managing bike became more difficult. So far, i love the new physics.And finally, AI became more difficult very slightly. But they don't seem to crash on their own that much which is very unrealistic.No managerial career mode, but the original career mode has a feature that managerial career mode had. The bike development. You gotta test the bike during weekend practice. You get points and you spend for improving your bike. This is a great feature but honestly, the career mode is boring as usual. You get up from Rookies Cup to MotoGP then what? It's too obvious. Just racing, testing, racing, moving to another team. At least 17 had side activities that could earn some extra fame and money but 18 doesn't have that.This is typical Milestone move every year. Add something for a new game, take more good things previous games had away. What a shame.Online is improved but still not that stable. No deticated server as usual.As a Ducati fan, i'm really disappointed when i realised one thing. There are NO DUCATI FAIRINGS.I mean, have you ever seen Jorge Lorenzo running without fairings this season?Some riders have fairings but it should've been able to turn on/off not just pre attached.Fairings became really important in MotoGP.I can't believe i have to run some top bikes without having fairings.People claims that this game has so many bugs but i still don't have any problems thus far.But judging from Milestone's been doing to their releases, sure i can expect some bugs to appear in any minute.MotoGP 18 supposed to mark the new direction of the series as start using Unreal Engine 4.But the big expection of fans became the big hell of disappointment.This is not recommendable if you already own 17.I can't see any significant improvement honestly other than weather effect.Slightly Improved physics is not enough for this game if you're seeking some unique over 17.It's a one step forward as well as two step backward.;16 June, 2018;

Every year same thing, before the game comes up they are announcing like its going to be a huge thing, like its going to be a revolution of the game, and at the beggining when the game gets released its good for the people that buy the game because there is always something new, but in the end they get bored and they realise that the game is just repeating itself all the time and always has the same bugs, overall Milestone is just a huge dissapointment and they just want to get your money, without doing anything to make the game better, i can guarantee you that if another developer took Milestones place the game would be so much better, but sadly Milestone is here to stay until 2021.

RIDE 5 - Racing Icons Pack;Wesley;387 products in account;1 person found this review helpful; Recommended 6.1 hrs on record;"If you think you're good at racing games, prove it. Win ONE race in this game with a full track and assists off. No rewinds. This is one of the hardest racing games I have played, and I've played a lot of them. Of all kinds.It took me four hours before I could complete a single lap without crashing. Alone. On a slow bike. On a dry track. About ten minutes after that, I won my first baby championship 1v1 race against an easy, unaggressive AI. Got cocky, dialed it up, placed last.Trying to corner with a thumbstick is about as easy as trying to paint with a blindfold on. Trying not to crash in this game is like trying to play four separate instances of F-Zero at once.Still, if you even slightly learn this game, you will feel like a god. I'm still high off that easy mode 1v1. (Also, it runs well and looks sick, especially in the FPV modes.)Downsides: Not enough tracks. Awkward narrative design that isn't terrible, but feels out of place. No Indian motorcycles.Biggest downside: Not enough freedom!!!!! If there's one thing I think reviewers are mad about, it's this. The game's called RIDE, not TRACK. I rarely feel like I am just ""riding"" in this game. I feel like I'm racing.Which is fine, but the things going on under this game's hood should not be limited to a pittance of tracks and pole positions. What I wouldn't give to cruise around an empty city or along a picturesque coastline without passing split gates or starting lines...BUT. If you're into racing games, this is where you should test your mettle."; 14 June;

Purchased for myself and my 5 year son that loves hot wheels. He waited months for the game to come out, in pure excitement that his favorite hot wheels cars where in such an exciting racing game. All he wanted was the DeLorean from Back to the Future. Between the two of us, we beat every race and boss, and earned that DeLorean. As my little dude was admiring the car in his collection - he went to add it to his favorites and instead hits the wrong button and POOF! Car is gone.So we raced on! Going over all the tracks again, earning coins, buying blindboxes again and again. Finally it appeared in the shop for 2000 coins. After selling a few cars, we purchased the DeLorean. Happiness achieved... An hour later... He's admiring the car in his collection, he puts the steam controller down, one of the LH or RH buttons is pushed against a nearby object... POOF! Car is gone.Developers Please Take Note - Your audience has a vast age rang. But most certainly, 5 year old boys will want to play your game. It must be considered that such a small person can easily make mistakes. I ask that you consider putting an ""Are you sure?"" dialog in place, when selling cars for gears or coins.Aside from that - This game is a LOT of fun. The cars are awesome. The tracks are really cool. It feels like a mix of Trackmania and Need for Speed (drifting is fun) placed in a world of Hot Wheels awesomeness. A little pricey, but we've already put 173 hours in and the game has certainly entertained me and my son.If you loved Hot Wheels as a kid, you should definitely grab this game.";9 November, 2021;

The look and feel of the little Hot Wheels cars with their super detailed, realistic models, the way they end a race looking scratched and beaten up only to go back to pristine condition in your collection, the authentic track designs with boosts and hazards in a number of fun environments, the terrific and addictive driving mechanics... If I were judging based only on the actual gameplay, this game would be a 10/10 no problem. And there's a track builder, and a livery editor.However.The scourge of ""additional monetization"" is really just too much to bear here. Microtransactions and lootboxes and season passes and high-priced DLC abound. You will never own the full game of Hot Wheels Unleashed, because you will constantly be missing out if you aren't feeding the corporate coffers at every opportunity.For your initial investment, you receive a handful of cars, like two tracks, and a basement headquarters that you can customize with like nine things. Oh but don't worry, you can always get new cars from blind boxes, new tracks from paid DLC, and new basement decorations with premium currency. Just make sure you get your digital money's worth before you finish the campaign mode, or you'll be grinding the same events over and over at a rate of ten or twelve per blind box.Some of the cars and most of the tracks are unlocked as you complete the campaign, but you will never feel like you aren't missing out on something. But don't worry, as Hot Wheels Unleashed also helpfully allows you to buy a rotating set of six cars every so often in the ""limited offers"" section. So the FOMO can last longer and stay stronger.You can also buy cars for real cash in the Steam store. Yeah. A buck here, a buck there, one car at a time gets added to your game. Basement decor and track builder parts are also for shill, in case you were worried the publisher wasn't offering enough avenues to hoover up your money.Then there are season passes *and* racing seasons. The current racing season is SpongeBob themed. Earn XP by grinding samey events and you can unlock decor and cars based around that dude who lives in a pineapple under the sea. EXCEPT, you only earn most of those unlocks if you've already bought the racing season in the Steam store. And right now, the store page for that particular DLC says this: ""At the request of the publisher, HOT WHEELS™ - SpongeBob Racing Season is no longer available for sale on Steam.""If this game had come out ten years ago, I would have adored it. Because if this game had come out ten years ago, it would not have been infested with scum sucking publisher taint. As it stands, however, the simple act of booting this game up makes me feel disgusting. Playing it for any length of time leaves me exhausted. And imagining recommending it to anyone makes me feel a unique blend of disgust, exhaustion and rage.Don't buy this game.

I cannot recommend this game, even at a sale.Some commenters below *suggest* that issues I list in my original review have been addressed. The patch notes say otherwise. The commenters are likely referring to changes to the limited offers. The change is okay. ""We increased the number of available vehicles from 5 to 7. Also the time needed to refresh it has been shortened from 4 h to 1:30 h. Moreover, we slightly reduced the chances to find common cars in this shop.""HOWEVER, I didn't even mention this in the review. patch notes can be found here: https://hotwheelsunleashed.com/game-updatesNow, RD02 was nerfed, but that was before my review was posted. So a single car out of 66 was deemed worthy of a revision. This does not change the abysmal vehicle balancing. We're talking about TOY cars. You should be able to pick whichever is your favorite, and be competitive, even if that means adjusting your playstyle to adapt. Another comment, well intentioned, but illustrative of a point I'd like to make: ""For a few dollars the Race Season content truly makes the game shine."" Consumers are paying $50 dollars for this game. I would NOT suggest investing in the race season to improve your gaming experience. The race season does note eliminate AFK players, which is this game's biggest issue. An issue which, as I highlight below, can literally make the multiplayer unplayable. Additionally, I still say that the DLC is basically no content INCLUDING the race season. Why? Well, at current pricing, you are paying $6 for 6 DC themed cars. How many of those are viable multiplayer options? (Idk, I can't be bothered to look it up) There's some other items in the season, but if you've played the game, you know that they are actually worthless. Trust me.Originally, this review was to be much longer. I had a whole section about whether this is a Hot Wheels game, or just DC Kart Racers. I complained about how certain cars can be catapulted into the air when someone rams you. Heck, I didn't even mention all the bugs I encountered because they didn't impede gameplay.So anyways, I went back and *tried to play some more after the update. There's still AFK players. And at 9:30 USC I couldn't even find a match. (Did I mention that there's no way to back out of lobby search? You have to force stop the game) Game's dead on PC, bro. Consistently less than 400 online during PEAK hours.I played this game for 50 hours, and waited a month after release to review it. I still stand by that review, because it is all still true.Also, you can apparently earn coins via Quick Races. So there's that.(original review Oct 26, 2021 50.7 hours playtime)I like this game. But honestly, I can't recommend it.Track editor and livery editors are great. Campaign is really challenging, but fun.There is no balance in this game. It's like it was never playtested. Why have 60+ cars when only 5 are viable choices? Upgrades don't matter, they only widen the gap. Coins are required to get cars. Multiplayer is THE ONLY way to obtain coins (campaign mode gives a FINITE amount of coins, and it's nowhere near enough). Coins are rewarded for EVERY placing in a race. A nice thought for accessibility. There is NO IDLE PLAYER KICK. This has led to an exploit where sit idly in lobbies for hours to collect coins. In general, this is a nuisance. Half of your 12 player lineup is idle, so it's really a six player race. Fine. When you complete a lap, you have to avoid the AFK roadblocks. Not fine. Players are rewarded for this behavior.Yesterday, I couldn't even play the game because I was continuously placed in the same lobby. The lobby of an ongoing race consisting entirely of AFK players. Did you know there is no time limit for races? I'm not mad that no one thought of this before launch. I'm mad that the problem still exists after the first DLC is being sold. DLC which, by the way, costs half the price of the game and is basically no content. Buyers deserve to know what they're getting into, so I'm leaving a negative review.";26 October, 2021;

I buy it every year. I'm part of the ??????? problem and I realize it. Guess what, I'll probably buy it next year. Don't be like me. Don't be an ???????. Go play literally any game other than this. It's not good. I'll break it down though.The Good:You can be on a factory team. That's neat. Only 3 games too late.You can kind of free style whip.....but it doesn't really work. It's like they tried to copy MX vs ATV all out, but it's still tied to the stupid push the sticks in opposite directions to trigger it. Maybe I'm just not getting it.I totally did a backflip on the wall at A2. That was cool. That being said, I landed flat from at least 75 foot up and rode it out.It's pretty. Like really pretty. It runs great. 1440 UW on full ultra runs a crisp 120 with no dips on my 2080.The compound is neat. Especially since you can take your friends into it.You can be a girl I guess. The Bad:The physics are awful. The bikes feel bad. They only kind of do what you want them to do some of the time. In fact, there's a few spots where you can do the same thing and the outcome is entirely different. You can rewind half a second and instead of crash, you ride it out. You can literally case every jump, and in some cases, it's faster. Is there a particular rhythm section you're struggling with? Just lean back and skim it like whoops.Speaking of whoops, just lean back and wheelie through them like Tomac at Daytona. I'm like 90% sure that the ruts that form during the race are purely visual. I've tried to hook ruts that look like they're up to the foot pegs and just blow right through them.LOL SOUND. Bikes sound mediocre at best. I'm also pretty sure I've heard the area announcer say ""Kenny is going to force the issue"" every 3rd lap on every race.Customization is bad.

Being forced to watch the auto pilot until the player has control.-- Lack of camera adjustments on options.---- Missing set default camera in options menu for those who enjoy more first person view or one of the other 3 camera options other than the default 3rd person.-- Loads of cutscenes at the beginning of each racing session (Heat 1/2, LCQ, Main Events). Making lots of 'press A to continue' on the screen after you opted to 'race'. Time wasting.---- Lack of full customization of Environmental Sounds. You'll be hearing the same voice overs through out the races from some live commentator in the stadiums and won't be able to disable these sounds because the minimum is 50% on the menu.

Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 3;Press;NOT INFORMED;23 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 2.7 hrs on record;The new monster energy supercross game brings many new things with it compared to the previous version from 2019.The first thing you'll have to do in the game is to create your driver and to choose your bike. You can adjust your driver & bike to the deepest details for a personal most wanted customization.There are several single player events you can go through from a career to single races and challenges to an official training compound. The game also includes a multiplayer mode with a few mini gamemodes next to the normal races.Choose from 100 drivers from different categories and race over many tracks on 15 stadiums. There are also a lot of custom tracks wich are made by other users. You can create your own tracks in the track editor wich is included in the game and share them with other users.The graphics look really good and you can really enjoying watching the fireworks.The physics are well done, you can anticipate the grip through the dirt very good. You can also adjust that grip if you put other tires on your bike.there are a lot of available tires to choose from, and each is unique in how they respond on the dirt or while making turns or other manouvers, it's up to you to find out what suits best for your driving style.The blocks at the sides of the route aren't a huge problem like in the previous version, in the 2019th version it made you fall from your bike faster then it does now. still when you end up next of the track you get a few seconds to get back on the track without respawning. If you respawn you will loose a couple extra seconds as well. Doing jumps and airstunts are also very good to controll, if you made one mistake on a jump the first time then it's not so hard to correct that jump the next time you'll have to do it. You can also enable 'flow aid' wich is some kind of help for you in order to do your jumps better. But you can also disable this function via the race options.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrKu9l0kDqQ You can also adjust your bike with new parts wich will improve your jumping and landing.In order to upgrade your bike you'll have to score points. In order to score points you'll have to perform clean manouvers or stunts. You can also use these points to change the appearance of your driver and you have several different slots so you can choose different styles that you like. this will prevent that the points you spend are not lost if, for example, you want another outfit without losing the first one.Once you saved enough points to customize your driver and bike, you'll probaly need to grab a coffee with you, the bike customization has so many options from different parts and brands, to different colors of each part to even the chain. Same goes for driver customization wich also gives you a lot of options. All this will ensure your look to be unique from all the rest in online multiplayer mode.You can change the difficulty level of the AI in the game but you aren't able to do this when you race against other people online. When you join an online game, you might have to wait a moment untill the current race has finnished. But this give you a chance to explore the spectator camera views and to learn techniques from other humans. As a spectator you'll have more camera views then in a normal race, but if you want to look at your performance in from these camera angle's then you should watch the replays of the races you done.Playing online is not only normal races, there are mini gamemodes as well wich are also fun and challenging to do. You can do checkpoints, where the racers will have to race from checkpoint to checkpoint and who has the highest score at the end wins the race.Knockout mode is an elimination mode, here a timer will count down and when this timers ends then the racer with the least points is eliminated from the race. At the end the racer with the most points will be the winner.In treasure hunter all players will start from different locations on the map and they'll have to race to a highlighted area on the map, inside this area you'll have to search for 'the treasure' Via sounds and vibrations on your gamepad you will have to locate the treasure inside this area.Singleplayer mode also comes with a championchip and also a career mode where you can also compete for the first time for the official Supercross teams of the 2019 championship.There is time attack where you'll have to do time challenges and an official training compound where you can enjoy freestyle fun or train your style. The compound also supports a co-op mode.the last singleplayer mode are the challenges, each challenge has a a large amount of levels, the higher the level, the more difficult the challenge of that level will be. I'll show you a couple of these challengesIn 'go with the flow', you'll have to perform jumps and follow the 'flow aid' in order to complete the challenge. The green color means that you are doing it good, the red means that you can do it better.In mind the gates you'll have to ride through the most gates you can before the time runs out. According from the color of the gates you can score more points.Holeshot hunt is all about speed and timing, the challenge is to beat your opponent on short parts on the tracks, whoever finnish first wins the challenge.There are a few other challenges wich i leave for you to explore. The game is in general very good, i really like to playing it as i like to do with all milestone releases. Each year they make huge improovements in the motorcycle racing genre. The game also runs great on a steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIKhGkJpUWE;9 February, 2020;

Offworld Trading Company;USS;NOT INFORMED;291 people found this review helpful15 people found this review funny; Recommended 148.2 hrs on record;Hello, dear reader. Depending on your interests and background, your experience with this game might be much different than mine or any other reviewer here. And looking at the other reviews on here, there are quite a few people who ended up putting this game down because they were confused or thought the game was too difficult. I don't write many reviews, but I am writing this in an attempt to convince you that this game just might be of interest to you and give some tips on how to understand the game better to speed up the learning curve.I study Economics. I am also an avid investor in the stock market. So when I picked up this game there was almost no learning curve for me as I already understood the basics of supply and demand. However, this game presents the concept of supply and demand in such a hands on and intuitive way that it actually greatly increased my understanding of market forces, which made me a better investor! I consider this game a great educational tool if you are interested in business, finance, economics, or any related field such as starting your own business. Heck, even if you don't do any of those things, it can be great for personal finance.Why? Because you learn first hand how a business operates. You start the game in debt. You have the option to wait and start the game without any debt, but this is a bad decision 99% of the time because time is money and losing even a few seconds in the beginning can put you way behind your competition. You also miss out on the best locations to found your new corporate space empire.However, this is not a problem! Here's a fact: MOST businesses are constantly in debt. Nearly all businesses use debt, not cash, to expand their operations and grow. This is counter-intuitive to the average non-financially savvy person. But it's true. When the FED lowers interest rates, they are lowering the costs for businesses to borrow money which in turn motivates businesses to take on more debt and grow. On the flip side, it discourages consumer saving, which can also harm the economy as a whole (see Austrian versus Keynesian economic theory).So, what this means is, in order to succeed in this game you must accept the fact that you're going to be in debt most of the game until maybe the very end, when you start buying out all your rivals to win the game. Debt is GOOD. Most of the people in the review section here probably thought that the first thing they had to do was pay down their debt, which crippled their ability to expand their operations and allowed their opponents to gain a huge advantage over them.That's one lesson this game offers. Personal finance gurus often tell people that the most important thing is to pay down their debt. It is hammered into their heads. They're not wrong, because most people are consumers and not investors. But the opposite is true for business. In a business, the main goal is to grow and reinvest, not to consume. Therefore, debt is a wonderful thing!! The money you would have spent paying down debt is MUCH better spent building another glass factory to produce more PROFIT!Another important strategy is to buy resources before you need them, while the price is still low. That way when you go to construct the buildings you need you're not paying the spot price at the time which could be high due to everyone else needing the resource. Of course, prices could also fall due to too many suppliers, so another aspect of the game is to monitor other players to see what they are producing (you can see other players' bases), as well as what resources they require so that you can preemptively stock up on those resources. The key is to constantly figure out which resources are the most profitable to produce not only now but also in the near future.So, there you have it. These two tips will save you a lot of time in learning the game and being on your way to enjoying it. You might even try to compete in the daily challenge from time to time (my highest is 3rd place) =D. And on top of that, you gain the invaluable skill of seeing first hand how free markets interact and businesses operate, and therefore learn to become more financially successful yourself.;14 October, 2019;
Offworld Trading Company;abtin;NOT INFORMED;326 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 7.2 hrs on record;"I was excited to get this game - Civ4 was my favorite civ and so I expected a lot from Soren Johnson.This is a much more accessible game than Civ. The complete lack of a combat system revolutionizes the RTS genre and feels alien, yet the core mechanics can be understood within 30-45 minutes of play. The interaction of the game sytems is complex, and mastery and strategy will take a lot of time to develop.You play one of four factions, each with different bonuses and penalties. It is vital to play to your factions strengths, because you are severely resource constrained and must make difficult decisions about how to expand.You interact with other factions in five ways: the map, auctions, the stock market, the black market, and the market.On the map, you compete for resources and tile placement. Taking a key tile from another player can be enormously damaging by preventing adjacency bonuses.In auctions, you bid against other players for a special bonus. This is the most ""head-to-head"" aspect of the game. Depending on game options, you are not constrained to bidding with cash on hand. Instead, you can go into debt to purchase the item. If you arent careful, you might win an auction to your overal detriment.On the black market, you purchase attack powers. These seem to suck, though perhaps I just don't understand how to use them effectively yet. You are very rate limited in how quickly you can purchase these powers, they go up in price quickly, and they are usually very weak. Disabling a tile for 60 seconds is painful, but doesnt seem to be enough to cause any long term damage.On the stock market, you buy and sell ownership stakes in each player's faction. You win by forcibly buying out the other players.And finally the market. You buy and sell resources, and your actions affect the price of the resource. In my view, a critical weakness of the game is that the market supplies unlimited resources. Resources are not supplied by other players. instead, the market steadily raises prices. One consequence of this is that there is no resource tech race - you can buy any resources at the start of the game, which really break the idea that you are a startup colony on mars. You also get no real benefit from being the first to supply another resource.The game also gives you very limited insight into the price elasticity of demand - how much price will change in response to a purchase or sale. This is probably because there isn't a ""real"" market system. In order to allow you to buy an unlimited amount of resources on the market, the game must model its own price elasticity of demand curve. This is contrived and can fall out of sync with the specifics of each game. You also have no insight into the global supply of a given resource - there is no way to answer the question ""Is this resource cheap because no one needs it or because everyone is producing a surplus?"" Perhaps if you had some way to view the global aggregate stockpile of each resource, this could be improved.Because of the way the market functions and the lack of insight into its details, it doesn't quite feel like you are playing with other players. Again, maybe this is just due to my inexperience.There are a couple UI issues:* An easy way to see the space market price for goods.* An easy way to find your buildings/tiles on the map.* Graphics performance is ok, but not good.Overall, I'm still pretty excited about this game. Its a new idea in RTS. It greatly reduces micromanagement compared to other RTS. It needs polish, but I think its going to make for some amazing multiplayer matches.";12 February, 2015;
Offworld Trading Company;Edgewalker;479 products in account;152 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 51.4 hrs on record;"I have read several negative reviews with valid criticism in them, but it rests on certain assumptions about what kind of game OTC is supposed to be. If you expect 4X, you'll be disappointed. Likewise with Starcraft. This isn't an RTS or a 4X game. It has elements of those games, but the comparison is unhelpful when trying to capture the kind of experience OTC offers.I would describe OTC as a real-time market and logistics management game, since that almost entirely describes it. You place buildings that process or gather raw materials, and placement has strategic value, since you must spend fuel to transport goods, and if your enemy is the only source of fuel, they can ruin you.There are no units to control, and building placement is highly restricted. Most of the time, you are trying to gain control of the economy by top-down actions, like choosing what to produce, buy, and sell. The bulk of the game is spent doing this, so liking this part of the gameplay is a requirement for liking the game overall.I have one major criticism, and it has to be said that this is a significant blow to the description of OTC as a market. One could expect a market simulation to take into account at least very basic economic principles. OTC does not. There is a tension between ""supply and demand"" that anyone would expect, but there's a problem with resources. Even if nobody on the map is producing something, every good is available to buy in an unlimited supply. Scarcity is never a serious concern since the amount of goods produced doesn't rely on anyone actually producing them.The quantity of goods on the market is never a factor. Also, the system of stock purchasing doesn't resemble real life. In particular, if someone can afford your stock, you must sell it, but you can never buy it back. These sacrifices were surely made to improve gameplay at the cost of simulation. This is a problem in all game development, and virtually no games get the balance right except by luck. Because of this, it's a problem I choose to forgive.My other problems are mostly about the UI/UX. For instance, lack of the ability to pause in multiplayer (except the host, and even then the option is hidden in submenus.) The lack of a minimap, and the inability to quickly and easily find and identify structures and transports are two more absent features. These things become a serious drag on the game after just a few play sessions, and will irritate players who like a good UI.My minor criticisms include a dull, drab setting (pumpkin sand forever in every direction), and ignoring a few accessibility features like color deficiency. Other than that, the AI is sub par, but again, whose isn't?Overall, I would recommend OTC because I enjoy the gameplay, but unfortunately I find it very difficult to describe the gameplay sufficiently. There's no substitute for trying it out.P.S.If you're a programmer or mathematition you would benefit from this additional information. OTC is like trying to constantly apply a linear optimization program to changing inputs. Or maybe solving a system of linear differential equations in real-time?";24 September, 2016;

Most negative reviews are based on players who expected something different than what this game is.Offworld Trading Company is not an economic sim. It's not a city builder. And it isn't a typical RTS simply reskinned with an econ theme, either. Don't expect slow build up, resource control, rock paper scissors, and turtle/boom/rush.The truth is there aren't any similar games on steam.It's a very fast paced tactical real time game that rewards swift adaptation to the resources on the map and opponents' strategies. It's tactical because, just as in business, market conditions will lead the intelligent player to pivot and shift tactics midway through the game.Every match deploys a discreet set of mechanics to ensure varying situational strategy.VARYING mechanics include:1. Black market tactics -- each map has only a portion of them available, and the particular combo is very important.2. Resources -- each map has a different mix of resources. Players choose a faction AFTER seeing them. For the most part players keep the resources they claim. This isn't war as such, or territory control.3. Market conditions set by player faction choice and by local colony demand -- respond BETTER and your faster capital accumulation will force him to pivot quickly.SET mechanics include:1. Patents -- these are techs that only the first player to buy has access to.2. Market manipulation -- artificially boost or lower prices.3. The commodity markets -- manipulate prices directly4. Stock buyouts -- buy your opponents stocks and make future buyouts easier. And protect yourself meantime.This game is about who knows how to use the tools better, and adapt their strategy earlier. The tools are at your fingertips, and the only limiting factors are your experience and your analysis.;4 November, 2017;
Offworld Trading Company;paeva;NOT INFORMED;125 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 30.9 hrs on record;"I really, really love this game. But nearly every single game, I get frustrated about the market mechanics. Bear in mind that this review is written based on beta as of Sept 2015.The game bills itself as a market simulation, and yet the price mechanics of pretty much everything just seem wonky. As far as I can tell, resource prices are probably influenced by what the other players are buying/selling, but in both cases, they're not using a supply/demand system, but instead some formula that bumps the price up and down with every sale/purchase. The net result is that prices fluctuate dramatically over the course of the game (which is not bad, and could be actually good), but that you never really feel like you understand why.The second part of this -- and the far more frustrating part -- is around the (current, as of Sept 2015) mechanics around winning, or ""buying out"" your opponents. Firstly, the concept of being ""bought out"" at twice your share price -- and thus ""losing"" -- is kind of weird, but in some circumstances it's incoherent. In a recent game, I owned 70% of my own company's stock, in addition to 60% of my opponent's stock. In real company terms, this would give me unilateral control over both companies. But no, instead, my opponent has a warning counter that starts at 50% and slowly ticks up to 100%, indicating that they have that percentage of the amount of money needed to ""buy me out"" and thus win. But at the same time, I'm saving up a hoard of cash to try and buy them out. But that doesn't seem to matter. My hoard of cash that's 50% of the value needed to ""buy them out"", my 70% stake in my own company, and my 60% stake in my opponent, all don't seem to matter. The stock prices seem to be ""faked"" much the same as commodities are, and they bear little connection to the actual value of the companies.That all said, I do recommend this game, as it's fun, and I love economic sims and there really should be more like this (I was really hoping for something more like Capitalism Plus, but alas). I hope and wish that the game's developers might put some energy into making the systems make sense, though.Update: Here's a screenshot demonstrating the phenomenon above. In this game, I took over two of four opponents and then just hoarded money and resources for a while. The remaining opponent eventually bought me out when their company had less cash on hand than I did, suggesting that the company stock prices are drastically undervalued. https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkosmyvvwd90hjk/Screenshot%202015-10-01%2011.50.43.png";6 September, 2015;

The story of De Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie. In English: ""The United East-India Company"". The game's mechanics perfectly translate the concepts underlying the VOC's heyday to a future space travel setting, with trading monopolies, seemingly absentee governments that grow dependent and friendly to your business, and cities being bought and owned as corporate entities through Monopoly Charters.When playing this game I encourage all players to consider their actions in that context, and imagine the relationship that you, the CEO, have with the locals, the other companies, the black markets and privateers, and the goldmine that is shipping these precious resources back home.

Meanwhile, the strategy space is increasingly filled with bloated epics that take eons to complete and require relatively little player input. Offworld Trading Company is the perfect counterpoint to both trends, providing endless varied games of meaningful complexity in a timeframe that makes losing palatable. it's compact enough to make you want to challenge yourself, and complex enough to actually let you.Offworld Trading Company is not a 4X game, but it manages to capture the consequence-driven excitement of the first 50-100 or so turns of something like a good game of Civ while chopping out everything that has the potential to become tedious or irrelevant. You have to determine priorities and bootstrap your way up the growth curve by pulling resources from a very limited number of tiles. payback horizons are short, and everything you do every matters immediately in obvious ways. Your ability to recognize and exploit marginal effects will dramatically affect your ability to put your grand strategy into effect.OTC not only gets this sense into a completely different format but actually manages to expand on the number of critical decisions without muddying or obscuring their consequence. choice of faction and choice of where to settle now feed back into decisions about when to settle and what to exploit. These decisions are in turn directly affected by opponent decisions via the game's stock market. even a sound strategy fitted to the map is not certain to succeed because awareness of opponent play has become part of its execution. The brilliance of, say, a Sid Meier design is generally the feedback between a number of subsystems and a larger game that incorporates them. this is as true of the fencing mini-game in Pirates!™ as it is of worker placement and city management in the Civ series: your degree of success in one area feeds into your performance in others, directly or otherwise.

I revisited it just recently, almost a decade later, and this game is still almost the exact same as it was. There's no goals, no points of interest, no reason to progress, just empty space. There's nothing to discover and it's still poorly optimized. But you know what there is? 14 new DLC packs that are mostly cosmetic, $5-10 each. For a game that was originally in early access and had so much room to grow, this is unacceptable. There's so much potential for this game and I really wanted to like it, but I cannot recommend it.; 8 June;

So, I find my satchel full of health drinks cause i rarely need them. I would suggest adding a second satchel JUST for stuff like the firebombs, and one JUST for health, or add an upgrade for said additional satchel?Well, those were my only tidbits, Complaints and or suggestions. I want to say here at the end, that this game is INCREDIBLE and i cannot recommend it enough. If you're looking for a great souls like VR game and can look past the things i mentioned, then this game IS for you. Again to the developers, I hope you see this and consider my suggestions As i adore this game and really would like to see improvement in those areas and to see this game thrive. I will be recommending this game to everyone i know that loves souls like games and VR. Keep up the great work!;28 June, 2023;

Grimlord;Mr.;NOT INFORMED;33 people found this review helpful; Recommended 1.7 hrs on record;This game is very much in an early access state, but it has potential.Pros:- It's an actual game with a campaign, and not just a sandbox- The world feels immersive and expansive and invites you to explore it, as a Soulslike should- The crafting system is very unique and cool to use- The devs are clearly commited to recreating Dark Souls in VR- The devs seem to be very open to much needed feedback from the communityCons:(I really have only one gripe with the game, but it's a big one, so switching to paragraph form)- The combat has potential, and is vaguely reminiscent of Dark Souls combat. But rather than capturing the engaging challenge of Dark Souls, it feels tedious. It's very easy to defeat enemies so far, but it takes many many hits to do so. Combat essentially consists of completing overly easily parries ad then hitting the enemy with your sword ad naseum. There is little to no feedback when you hit the enemy. Eventually they will fall over and look dead. After a while they will get back up, unless you hit them repeatedly while they lie on the ground, not knowing whether or not they are dead (a finishing move would make this much more engaging). It's hard to tell how much damage you are dealing, so it's just a tedious battle of attrition. The dodge feels clunky and there is no incentive to use it. Enemies tend to clump up due to overly aggressive aggro and too much clustering of spawn points, leaving to very long, drawn out fights. To beat the first boss I just stood right in front of him and kept hitting him in the face until he died. It wasn't challenging in the slightest, it just took a long time.If I could leave a mixed review I would. I love where the devs are going with this, and I'm excited to see the end result. As it stands right now, the clunky combat takes away most of the enjoyment for me. I wouldn't recommend buying it at its current state unless it's on a steep sale. But I decided to leave a positive review, because this is one of the few VR sword fighting games that actually offers a fully fledged campaign, and not just a sandbox experience.; 9 January E;

This game is fun in a lot of ways and really frustrating in others and not for the reason you think. Enemies don't have collision with each other and most of their attacks advance them towards you so they just kind of end up in a big pile you have to poke at until it's dead and a lot of the fighting gets interrupted by the wonky physics which catch on the enemies arms and legs a lot. The main reason it feels so off is because the enemies don't adhere to the physics like you do. They can swing through walls, each other, etc. which causes combat to feel very cluttered and messy. If you enjoy things that are unfinished this is a solid start and worth the investment to see what it becomes, but if you get easily frustrated with messy physics implementation and poor enemy balance you're gonna have some roadblocks. Nothing this game has thrown at me has been too frustrating to deal with outside of the engine issues which is how I know with time it will be more than worth the 25 they are currently asking (at time of this review).;1 November, 2023;

However, this game is in Early Access, to those issues are to be expected. I do hope combat is improved to make it more Souls-like. I would say the melee combat is a notch below Hellsplit Arena. Combat seems to be too reactive. I would like to see arms or legs being chopped off. It seems only decapitations work.

But I cannot in good faith recommend this game. To start with some very basic problems, the servers are ???????. All the time now I disconnect mid fight and its so frustrating considering the sometimes long queue times. On top of this they have done a terrible job balancing heroes in my opinion. the lawbringer rework is horrible and made him worse in my opinion (I used to be rep 70 on him) while other characters like hitokiri and shugoki are grossly overtuned with an unreactable bash, hyper armour, variable timed heavies, and insane I frames on goki's headbut. This shines especially in duels which makes the game incredibly frustrating unless you're also playing an S tier hero. 4v4 is also not great, though I have less complaints. the only balanced gamemode (Dominion) certainly has some fun to it and team fights are cool and fun, however it is ruined by the unbalenced heroes mentioned earlier as well as many uninteractive unfun feats. It is honestly difficult to think of a single feat in this game that is both fun to use and fun to play against. Take javelin or glads trident for example. theres no interaction and if you're in a team fight and the enemy is off screen or even in a 1v1 they can press a button and you just tank 50 damage. its similar to shinobi's old ranged gb which is hilarious considering they removed it for being unbalanced. The same is true for almost any feat in the game, nail bomb just nukes your health and is an easy win for whoever uses it unless you have second wind, umbral shelter just makes your team unkillable for 15 seconds, kiai instantly puts someone out of stamina which is incredibly frustrating. the list goes on. it turns what would otherwise be a skill based and fun experience into a frustrating experience with little to no counterplay. This aside, the game completely lacks new content and ubisoft (of course) seems more focused on pumping out skins and battle passes rather than balancing. this patch was horrible and while nerfs to some OP heroes came, they're more like band aid solutions to the bigger problem. Hito can still heavy spam with little to no repercussions and characters like shaolin, ocelotl and shinobi received almost no changes. even with many of the feat nerfs, its still incredibly frustrating and thats because they're poorly designed to begin with. Nobushi still hasn't received any offence since the CCU if i remember correctly and its become more and more clear to me that ubisoft just doesnt give a ???? about this game anymore. They're not worth your money or your time. Take the money you would spend on For Honor, buy Elden Ring instead and thank me later; 13 June;

The rear is bouncy and steps out way too much on corner entry imo. It feels like I have MotoGP style engine brake in a bike from the 1980s.Very little has changed from Ride 4, apart from content that could've been brought in as DLCs like the newer models of the litre bikes, a few tracks, etc.The story mode, especially starting out with that narration (which I personally don't like, but oh well) had more potential. Why am I on a 1980s Endurance Racer just 5 'cups' into my career? How do I transport my bike on a trailer from wherever I live (assuming it's what you put in in the rider info - in my case Germany) to Suzuka, Japan when I'm just starting out racing? It feels very weirdly put together, without passion, without thought or regard how the ladder of motorcycling could or would work in the real world.Also, and this is a personal issue of mine, I feel like small bikes don't get the recognition they deserve in the Ride titles. We have SSP300 championships on a nationwide and international level virtually all over the globe, so why don't we get Ninja 400s, Kove 300s, etc. in these games anymore? I remember the days of Riding Spirits 2 for example that basically had all bikes your mind could think of and your heart desired. I understand it's about licensing, but man, I'd be fine trading in some of the very similar looking MV Augustas for some more variety immediately, don't even get me started on Bimotas or Vyrus models.Overall, this game is the biggest disappointment in gaming for me so far this year. I was really looking forward to it and now regret not having waited another week and reading the critiques before buying this 40gb of software. At least I didn't get the cash grab Season Pass that's going to flood this game with more of the same looking bikes and same old boring tracks we got in Ride 4...

RIDE 5;things;NOT INFORMED;110 people found this review helpful; Recommended 1,058.1 hrs on record;Ride 5 In Depth ReviewNew to the Ride games? The developer has created a game changing type of game. Ride 5 has a Career mode that can provide many hours of enjoyment in itself. You have a chance to collect over 200 bikes which have been painstakingly modeled in amazing detail. On top of that you can ride them on realistic near perfect models of some of the best circuits in the world. There are a few circuits I have ridden and I can say they it gives me goosebumps of how accurate they are. If you have a decent gaming pc, some of the gameplay is easily mistaken for videos of real racing. My advice is try out the Career mode and collect some bikes while getting to the point where the AI is easy to beat and you can finish 3 laps without crashing. When you have reached this level, you will be comfortable diving into Multiplayer, which is another world inside this game. I have met a ton of great people through the Ride games who are helpful and fun to ride with. For the cost of this game, I can go out to eat and get a movie (once). Think about it, the justification is simple. If you race bikes or want to do trackdays, this game can even be a tool to familiarize yourself with a circuit you have to ride on in the near future. Hope to see you online.Ride 4 players who are not sure if they want to switch Look at the dates of the reviews.

RIDE 5;Jo3f1sh;NOT INFORMED;85 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 168.5 hrs on record;"I've sunk 32 hours into this game so far, and it's given me enough time to really express how disappointed I am with Milestone's 5th attempt to iron out this series.I'll start this off with a list of bugs, glitches, and general gripes I have with this game:1. If you use rewind during an endurance race, you've pretty much broken it, and the race will never end.2. Replays after qualifying and after a race with a qualifying session don't work.3. When track lights turn on at dusk, the entire game stutters down to single digit frames before recovering. If you're in the middle of a turn when this happens, good luck.4. AI bikes are so loud, you can't hear yours if you're in a pack...which you will be for every career race since you always start 10th if there's no qualifying session. There's no option to change this in audio settings.5. ""Rival"" NPC's are obviously overpowered, and will perform 2-3 seconds faster than anyone else on track, including you on the same bike. Sometimes, if they group together, there will be a 6-7 second gap between the rivals group, and the rest of the pack.6. AI bikes still do not detect the player at all, and will ride through you. Even if you crash, the AI will keep turning into your riderless bike until it disappears, with no attempt to avoid it. This is exacerbated by the fact that you will always start 10th in career races that don't have a qualifying session.7. AI difficulty is wildly inconsistent. I'm a top 10 leaderboard rider in Ride 4. At Road Atlanta, I can barely keep up at 70% difficulty. At VIR, i'm 4 seconds ahead by turn 3 at 120%.8. Resolution scaling is broken. 50%-200% provides no change.9. Turning off motion blur still creates ghosting, just as it did in Ride 4.10. The ""warbling"" engine sound when in the mid-range of the powerband is still there from Ride 4.11. In order to obtain multiple liveries for a bike, you now must buy the bike in that livery. Bike affinity no longer grants this. If you're gifted a bike in a livery you don't like, too bad because...12. You still cannot get rid of gifted bikes. If you don't want multiples of the same bike in your garage, too bad.13. The rear brake is now useless at any lean angle. You can no longer use it to adjust your line in a corner. It only aids in straight line braking. Mash it to 100% at max lean, and the bike does nothing.14. The menu navigation has been changed for the worse. In career mode but just want to turn a few laps on your own? You have to back all the way out to the main menu, and then change the mode. Some menu selections also make no sense. Sometimes you press ""A"" to select something, sometimes you press ""Start"". Was that really necessary?15. The ""career"" mode locks your progress to a linear set of races. You cannot progress at your leisure like in Ride 4 by choosing what types of bikes you'd like to race. You must race the bikes it tells you to in order to progress to the next set of races. Want to race 600cc bikes? You'll have to race 1960's 500cc's first to unlock them. Don't want to race endurance races too early in your career? Too bad, you're racing them by your 5th set of races, and you're not going to race anything else until they're done.16. The ""career"" progression makes no sense. The game tries to paint this picture of an up and coming rider just starting out and trying to make a name for themselves, but you're globetrotting around the planet from the get go. Rather than starting off in your desired region, and then unlocking races in different regions like in Ride 4. It just makes no sense.17. The narration is abysmal and cannot be skipped. This includes ""rival"" introductions before some races. If you have to restart the race for any reason, you're getting the un-skippable intro every time.18. The track selections for some of the races make no sense. 1000cc bikes on a tiny twisty track is not really that enjoyable. The bikes are heavy, hard to change direction quickly, and you never get out of 2nd or 3rd gear.19. Finally, bike handling has changed dramatically. While in and of itself not a bad thing, there are some definite odditites that now exist. The bikes are defininitely more difficult to turn, and have too much grip, especially on corner exit. It is now VERY difficult to high side. You have to intentionally slam the throttle wide open in 1st or 2nd on a 1000cc bike in order to get any rear tire slippage. Braking is...ok, but seems somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes you can brake deep into a turn, sometimes you can't even breathe on the brake lever. The bikes also seem to headshake VERY easiily, and recovering from it is near impoissible unless you stand the bike up and ruin your race. Maybe steering dampers should be an adjustable setting?20. They've removed some enjoyable entry level bikes (KTM 390, Honda CBR300, etc.) for some reason. These would be great introductory bikes for those small twisty circuits early in your career. No idea why these were removed...Well, there you go. These are just mine and some of the reported issues with Ride 5. You may be able to over-look all of these things and have an enjoyable experience. If so, that's great and I'm glad you're having fun! But for me, having dumped so much into this franchise, I was expecting an improvement on what was probably Milestone's best attempt at a true motorcycle racing experience to date (Ride 4). But instead, they decided to remove some of the things that made that game good (open career progression, satisfactory bike handling, good UI), and introduced others that add no value (narration, rivals, etc. See list above).The game still looks pretty good, and runs well on my hardware, so I'll still keep playing it despite the list above. They've added some new tracks that are a worthwhile addition (Autopolis and Le Mans especially). The bikes still look amazing, and turning laps is still an fun way to burn some time. However, the races are simply rage inducing (again, see list above).In the end, there's still no alternative for what is basically the Gran Turismo of bikes. But at this point, 5 games later and with all these issues, I really wish there was. RIMS racing was close, but has since been abandoned. Shame.";31 August, 2023;
RIDE 5;Coldheart;NOT INFORMED;59 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 142.3 hrs on record;You can see my playtime, I've given this game a decent go and been through a few patches now. Here's why I can't recommend it:- The physics are really tame. Even with all assists off, it's quite hard to lose the rear wheel. There's almost no risk of an endo if you smash the front brake even at 160mph+- The bike selection might be 200+ bikes, but most of these are ten variations of the same model. Counting two different years of the same model with a tiny change, then the race modification and the endurance modification seems a bit cheap. There's a distinct lack of smaller CC bikes too- The graphics are a mixed bag. Bikes look great, but shadows of the bike on the track aren't quite connected to the bike and make it look like it's floating.The skybox looks like it's from a 2003 game, especially in overcast evening weather- It's nice having a day/night cycle, but bad that the game absolutely chugs and will make you crash when the track lights come on- Increasing the resolution slider does precisely nothing- FRUSTRATING endurance race bug, which supposedly has been patched but as of today is still occuring. Look forward to spending at least 20 minutes racing before crossing the line and the race doesn't end. I did manage to find a workaround but this no longer works since the patch- The career mode gets really stale really quick. There's some tracks in the game that just don't get used (no exagerration, some tracks haven't been in a single race in the career) and others that are seriously overused (and it ALWAYS rains!)- The AI can set god like qualifying times. Sometimes they will be at least 20 seconds faster than your best effort in the dry, when qualifying is in the wet!- AI still tries to kill you, regardless of the new behaviour settings- The majority of career races stop you from using race tyres, but permit the AI to use slicks. They'll be on soft tyres in the rain while you're on stocks and they lose no pace whatsoever from this- During autopilot (leading into a race, time attack or in and out of the pits), there's a good chance the AI will straight up crash you into a wall or slip across the grass/sandThere's more than that but you get the point.Really disappointed.;10 September, 2023;

Ride 4 has shockingly poor physics, good on release then nerfed.In Ride 5 you can actually lose traction and crash, imagine that! I'd like to see the level of grip reduced even further for pro mode. The ability to just boot it out of corners is too unrealistic. Which would be my main concern. For those of us who really play the Ride games we asked for Ride 4 as it was meant to be. There was a great game hidden away behind the fails. Which is essentially what Ride 5 is. There are issues, same as every game.;25 August, 2023;

Attacks are telegraphed enough to know what you have to do to avoid them, but still quick enough to test your skills.- Challenging: opponents can get pretty challenging by the end (in a good way). The AI is not dumb and every opponent has something different to offer.- Audio: music and voice acting is pretty good as well overall.- I encountered no bugs while playing it. :)**Cons:**- A bit short! I wanted to keep fighting!!- I hope the main menu can get its own background song (it has an audio track, but since I liked the songs during the fights I wish the main menu had its own catchy song as well) xDOverall it's a pretty good game, reminded me of old boxing games but with a WAY better presentation, and it feels very good to throw punches and make combos.

Thunder Ray;Vergil;NOT INFORMED;9 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 1.6 hrs on record;"I want to play Punch-Out, but it's not quite Punch-Out. Attacks are confusing to parse, especially when in many cases a right swing can either be a ""dodge into it"", a ""dodge away from it"", or even a ""block it"". Had no clue you were supposed to block a certain attack until I saw the trailer. Since the punches are all functionally similar and counterpunches do not offer much of a reward, it ends up feeling like you have one actual punch. Charged punches take too long and aren't worth the DPS, and I can't really get a hang of my options.A shame, since it's a very attractive game, but it needs some more intuitive mechanics. If these sorts of things can somehow be modified, I'd gladly recommend it.";16 November, 2023;

There is no choice in creating paths, very few locations to build towers, and little variety among the towers available. Over the course of the game, you do not ""level up"" in any way. You do not unlock new towers or improve your towers. You simply play on new maps with the same towers. Lastly, the towers always seem to target the enemy closest to them, rather than the enemy furthest ahead, so they often do a little damage to several enemies without killing any of them. There is no way to adjust the towers' targeting behavior. Other than the soundtrack, there is very little that is distinctive or excellent about the game, and there are plenty of other games that do the same thing better.";4 July, 2016;

Yeah, you have to defend a hard rock stage and your towers are actually different types of sound amplifiers and speakers.I found everything brilliant, really.. never thought about such an idea xDAnd the game is funny, graphics and mechanics are very simple of course (the game costs less than 1€, so of course it's an indie issue) but very enjoyable, with a good difficulty curve and an awesome array of amplifiers/towers to upgrade and defend your rock festival xDI've been to thousands of concerts so maybe this influenced me a bit ahah :)You also have many of the most important features in tower defense games: special skills, speed up button, call enemy wave early and so on.So for being an indie game it's really entertaining and new for its idea!I saw lots of negative reviews that to me have little valid points. It's a game made by a single developer, so of course it has its flaws.. but for 1€ it offers a great tower defense experience.Obviously, mainly if you're not used to this genre, the game can be repetitive.. even the best tower defense games if you want to 3-star every level get repetitive.. this game hasn't that variety but hey, fixed spots in which you can place towers are a feature of more than a half of the tower defense category and it's not a bad thing to me. Just look at the Kingdom Rush games, or even Cursed Treasure which has fixed spots for mana recharging and such, Idk, it's not a bad thing to me. Highly customizable tower defense series like Gemcraft can be boring for other aspects maybe, but I mean, again, it's a one-guy game here.A negative thing that I could point out is that actually the music is quite boring and you may expect something way more entertaining for a game based on music on its premises, but I play most of the games muted and listening to other things so yeah I couldn't enjoy the soundtrack, it's a downside but who cares in the end.I'd really recommend this game, of course it comes after dozens of other ones in this awesome genre but still it's a positive addition for us :);10 December, 2017;
Rock 'N' Roll Defense;Knuffybaer[GER];NOT INFORMED;20 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 14.5 hrs on record;Information Rock 'N' Roll Defense is a tower defense developed by NukGames. Gameplay As in all good TD games, the core gameplay is extremely addictive. As in any TD game, you have to build your towers to fight off the monster waves. In this game, music fans are your opponents and music devices serve as buildings. Different towers can be removed so that they become stronger, this is also important in the later course, otherwise you have no chance against the crowd of fans. Grafic / Sounds The designs and graphic style of the towers are great and the enemies are unique. The music reflects the atmosphere of the game and has been well integrated. Pro + addictive gameplay+ interesting story+ new upgrade options+ good soundtrack+ no microtransactions+ Achievements and trading cards Kontra - Levels are sometimes too easy Fazit Rock 'N' Roll Defense is one of the best tower defense games in this genre.

Luck be a Landlord;Kit;NOT INFORMED;74 people found this review helpful; Recommended 349.9 hrs on record;The negative comments on this game talk about how the balance is very unfavorable to the player and in order to win, you have to be very lucky. These complaints are valid. But they leave out an important piece of context: This game is being very actively worked on!The developer is constantly tweaking with the game balance. If you look over patch notes, you'll see tons of changes to how individual items behave, new items being added, and entire new game systems being included. Over the months, these changes have been very favorable to the player. It used to be that you'd have to play many rounds before you had one where winning was even a possibility, but now most games are winnable as long as you have a decent strategy in mind.And I think it speaks volumes that the dev is working on the game so hard. They communicate the changes they're working on very clearly. Patch notes go into precise detail about every change with each update. They also tell you what to expect in upcoming updates and how long they will take to be released. The game itself has a countdown timer until the next update on the main menu! And after a major release, the dev usually pushes hotfixes very quickly to address crashes. Which sounds sloppy, but I've never run into a crash myself - it's simply that the dev doesn't want to leave any loose threads.This game is a labor of love, and it shows. It's a blast to play. And it only keeps getting more fun and more balanced.;17 July, 2021;
Luck be a Landlord;jacojerb;544 products in account;57 people found this review helpful; Recommended 87.5 hrs on record;"This is an interesting game. It's basically like a distilled rogue-like, in a way. The gameplay is very simple. Each round, you spin the ""slot machine"", get some money and choose a new symbol to add to the slot machine. You get given a choice between 3 different symbols each spin. After a certain number of spins, you need to ""pay your rent"". If you can not pay your rent, you lose. If you can pay your rent, you get given a new symbol to add to the slot machine, as well as a new item. Items generally have passive effectsVery few items affect this core gameplay. Two I've gotten so far that expand the gameplay includes one that allows you to switch the positions of two symbols, and one that allows you to reroll your choices of symbols given after every spin (for some money, of course). Considering that I've only gotten each of these items once in my 7 hours of gameplay, I think it's fair to say that the core gameplay doesn't change muchSo considering the limited interactions you generally have (choosing symbols and items), what is the point?Unlike normal slot machines, you're not trying to line up multiples of the same symbols (although some items do give you small bonuses for doing this). Instead, you want to get symbols and items that synergize with each other. For example, one of the symbols is a dwarf. If a dwarf is next to an alcoholic beverage, they will consume it and give you a big cash influx. Not all synergies rely on consuming symbols. An example of this is the chef, who doubles the value of all adjacent food items. Some items also give passive bonuses to certain symbols. For example, there's an item that makes all gemstones give +1 their usual amount of moneyFinally, there are items that change some symbols entirely. For example, there are some symbols that are just urns. They don't synergize with anything (as far as I'm aware), however if you have a specific item, urns have a chance to break, turning them into spirits (which give a lot of money)So this is where it gets tricky. Almost all symbols really need certain specific other symbols to be effective. Considering that the symbols you get offered after every spin are random, it's impossible to predict what will actually be good. Some runs, I've had all but one of the ingredients for a big combo, but lost because I just could not get the last piece I needed...So, with that, I consider this game unfair. Unlike most other roguelikes, you can not win every game of Luck be a Landlord, even with a theoretical ""perfect strategy""... And that's okay. It is a slot machine roguelike. Your goal is to make the most of the symbols and items you get given. Often times, that won't be enough, and I really think that that's fine. I think, if you're a fan of risk/reward systems in roguelike games, you'll probably enjoy this.";25 January, 2021;

Worms W.M.D;Brandongl;NOT INFORMED;96 people found this review helpful19 people found this review funny; Recommended 22.1 hrs on record;"Possibly a review of Worms as a franchise rather than just WMD specifically.I've enjoyed Worms for a long time, not just for the MP, but mostly the Single Player. Worms is a strategy game that's both simple, and also has absolutely no RPG elements. There's no grinding a unit or worry about how terrible that level up was for Lyn or farming for equipment and hoarding for later missions. Every mission in Worms, is a carefully crafted area to give you a fair but hard trouble (At least, later in the game. They start off jokingly easy of course). The later missions will outnumber you 4 to 12 worms with twice the health, and it's you'll feel great when you outsmart their dumb-but-superaccurate AI.Worms MP is probably the most popular though, and many people play it as a joke for stupid fun. It's the type of game where when you make a mistake, it's pretty funny how it stacks up. It also has goofy weapons such as a super sheep and even a Grandma. Despite the stupid fun, I equate this game to Smash Bros in terms of ""You play it for stupid fun, but then you'll end up playing it as an esports"". This game has the possibility to be a legit competetive game with the proper ruleset, and Team17 is definitely acknowledging this with their ESL support in WMD.Worms WMD as an entry in the franchise is great. It goes back to cute 2D graphics with 60fps animations, rather than stupid ugly 3D graphics in a 2D game with 30fps animations. The rope is back to being unrealistic (can rope straight up, fast, hard and not wiggly), large variety of weapons, full length campaign and extra challenges, fully-featured multiplayer.The surprise is what they added, crafting. At first, ""oh my god why does everything have crafting"", then I realize the genius. This diminishes the RNG of crate drops by being able to craft what you want, but the real improvement? You have something to do on someone elses turn. No more waiting boringly. Speaking of which, this game switches turns fast (I recall an earlier Worms, there's a 10 second wait from when a turn ends and when a turn starts)Highly recommend this Worms in particular, and the franchise in general.That's right, I wrote a legit review for stupid Steam summer sticker books.Edit: Oh crap, the quest was to vote if a review was helpful or not... not write a review.

Worms W.M.D;PeterTheZoo;54 products in account;96 people found this review helpful26 people found this review funny; Recommended 237.1 hrs on record;I recommend this game, as it is lots of fun, but at the same time there are reasons I would not recommend it. Let me explain.As a single player it offers a variety of missions and challenges, which can keep you occupied for a while. But competing against A.I. gets boring quickly, because of how predictable (and bad) your computer opponents are, and then you really want to play against other humans. If you’re in a household with other family members or have real life friends to play with, it should be ok. However, if you’re a single guy living alone, like me, you have to venture into the online world to find people to play with.For many years, I have avoided playing online games on Steam, and here I was once again reminded why I made that conscious decision back then. Now, let me first say that I did meet a bunch of nice people to play with, but, unfortunately, as always, there are a few bad apples that tend to stick out. I was barely 100 online games in, and was already confronted with the most foul language you can imagine, rage quitters, people kicking me from games, just because I won the previous one and certain “top players”, who think they are God’s gift to humanity, just because they are skilled in an online game and don’t shy away from reminding you every 2 minutes of it. These people can really ruin your online experience. If you’re a parent and you allow your child to play this game online, you may want to bear this in mind. I don’t know if these are kids or adults who never grew up emotionally, but I have ZERO TOLERANCE for this kind of behavior, especially the foul language (which goes as far as rape and death threats). I don’t care what your mental disability is, I WILL report you.Other than that, finding people to play a game with can take a while. At times the lobby is pretty much empty. Of course, this game is already 4 years old, so naturally most people have moved on. But when you do have a game with a bunch of good people, it sure is a lot of fun. Being able to use vehicles, mounted guns, hide in buildings and craft tons of insane weapons is awesome!;10 August, 2020;

Have they made enough Worms games yet? More than 20 games exist in the main Worms series, and there's still games like Worms Blast and Worms Crazy Golf that take the physics of the Worms games and apply them to other mechanics.What improvements were made from, say, Worms 2 (1997) to Worms: Reloaded (2010)? Umm... Worms: Reloaded did have hats. Don't get me wrong, aside from the period where things went off the rails and the Worms games went full 3D, many of the newer installments have been quite good, but they just haven't really added or changed anything worthwhile. I would be perfectly happy playing one of the original games.Worms W.M.D is literally a game-changer. W.M.D takes the classic 2D Worms formula, and adeptly outfits it with enough new shiny mechanics and enhancements that it's a wonder it wasn't done before.This installment of Worms adds vehicles: tanks, helicopters, and mechs, etc. Each vehicle has a set of disadvantages and advantages, and they all look and sound amazing. The drillboat is capable of traversing land OR water, which can be extremely useful in certain situations. While you can cause some major destruction inside of these vehicles, don't get caught in a bad spot. it's going to hurt when one of them explodes with you inside. Additionally, the game adds machine guns, flamethrowers, and other stationary weapons around the map for you to use as you crawl around the map. Nothing in this game feels superfluous, and it all has a reason behind it. I've found myself realizing game after game about the sometimes not-so-obvious merits and side effects of the new map elements.Over the years, I've bought new Worms games and enjoyed them, but frequently found myself disappointed when some of the great classic weapons were removed. I'm proud to report that W.M.D brings back ALL of the best weapons from the series, as far as I'm concerned. Banana Bomb, Concrete Donkey, Super Sheep, Holy Hand Grenade, Sentry Gun, Carpet Bomb - they're all here... and they can be upgraded. In Worms W.M.D, a new crate drop has resources that you can use to craft weapon upgrades, as well as new weapons. This means that you can upgrade your Concrete Donkey to an Angry Concrete Donkey, which falls through the earth covered in FLAMES. The Shotgun can be upgraded into a Training Shotgun, which has laser sights on it. And if you are having a hard time finding the classic Ming Vase, the Dynamite upgrades into it, which makes sense, as having them be separate item slots would be redundant. The Ninja Rope is back again, and the physics are actually shockingly similar to the classic Worms games, which will be a relief for roping veterans.Maps now will usually have buildings on them if they are enabled. When inside a building, your worms can crawl through their tunnels and seek strategic vantage points. If you don't have any worms inside a building, you can't see any enemies that may be inside. It's very well done, and adds an extra stealth element to the game.While the game still very much shines as a multiplayer/party game, the single player modes are engaging and exciting. There are many challenges of different sorts for you to complete, and as you complete them you will unlock various goodies, such as new speech banks (accents) for your worms.The sound effects, particle effects/explosions, and environments are all fantastic and set a new standard for the series, too. Excellent.Having played MANY of the Worms games in my lifetime, I can confidently say that Worms W.M.D is the best game in the series. It honors the wisdom of the original games by retaining their strengths while innovating in just the right ways. If you have ever found this series even remotely interesting, you need to buy this one.;21 March, 2020;

You start a farm, you gradually build up to bigger and faster equipment, adding more and more land as you expand. Then you get bored. Then you start a new map. Then you run out of stock maps and decide to give mods a try. At this point you are irredeemable. The next thing you know, you're like me. Sitting on 1,350 hours and 5 completed farms and you're lonely. So you think, ah I know. I'll involve my friends. So you throw together a mod pack, get everyone on the same page and generally enjoy your time. Everyone finds their own little niche and does well working together. Then one by one they fade away, because they're not addicted like you are, and they find doing the same thing over and over a bore and repetitive because they don't have a second monitor to watch videos on the side or listen to their perfectly crafted motivational farming music playlist like you. So now you have 6 or 7 farms that you're the sole caretaker of, and you're always browsing the mods and watching farming simulator videos on YouTube to see if there's any new maps that catch your eye. Oh, and of course, you'll pre-order the new one as soon as it's announced, because who knows what new lands you'll tame? I don't regret a single hour I spent playing and would gladly do it again.;28 August, 2020;

Car Mechanic Simulator was a fun gimmick, but Farming Simulator? That just sounds ridiculous... and it is.This game is ridiculously relaxing, rewarding, and enjoyable. There's a lot more than just ""farming"" too. There's the aspect of building a farm, laying out where buildings will go, organizing tractors, trucks, and tools. There's the whole financial strategy part too. do i buy this tractor, lease it, or continue to use the old basic piece of junk for another harvest or two, and should i plant corn and turn it into silage, or plant soybeans for profit, maybe plant oat and bale the straw afterwards? It's just crazy how much honestly goes on in a simple simulator. And with mods, this game can even become a farm manager game as you send workers out to plow, cultivate, harvest, transport crop, etc.I love it though. I can work all day, getting stressed and frustrated, but then come home and relax as I just let the tractor drive lines up and down a field planting, or use a harvester to collect crops, and it's just so damn easy to get lost in.I know a lot of people look at Farming Sim and laugh, but this is honestly one of the best games I've put my time into.

Good job Giants :DAlmost every single aspect of the game has been improved from FS17 in some way. Most notably:- item handling: Moving things by hand is no longer frustrating! Things no longer fly out of your hand whenever you touch anything, no Herculean strength to flip tractors with a piece of wood and able to rotate items in-hand. Looking forward to conventional balers at this point.- vehicle handling: greatly improved, steering feels much more realistic (using keyboard), you can feel you're driving a several ton piece of machinery, suspension and ground response better than ever- vehicle maintenance: vehicles no longer have daily maintenance fee, instead they have wear and tear that you have to fix for a small fee (similar to what Seasons mod did in FS17), resulting in massive decrease in passive running cost for the farm (idle vehicles don't cost you)- land management: you no longer own entire map except the fields, land/field expansion feels more natural with having to buy the land. Buy a forest, cut down the trees and turn it into farmland!- buildings: finally able to build up your own farm other than just adding a couple sheds, although placing stuff on anything but a very flat ground can cause issues. Upcoming terraforming feature will fix that, potentially. Also choice of buildings in base game is limited, but I'm sure modding community fill flood the game with dozens of new items soon.- field management: new lime and weeds mechanics, greatly expanding on the ""fertilize 3 times"" approach from FS17, more stuff to do between sowing and harvesting phases- new stuff: cotton, horses, sugarcane (for those without FS17 platinum). All with their own mechanics/machinery. More variety of stuff to do, even if cotton is pretty bad profit compared to other crops.- contracts: complete overhaul of missions, much less clunky although somewhat buggy at the moment (weeds will overtake NPC fields permanently)- animals: chickens are finally not useless, as eggs will spawn in boxes without having to collect them manually. Placeable animal pens require higher initial investment in livestock, similar to buying fields for arable farms. - shop: better separation of vehicles and implements into categories, full 3D preview of machinery and its configuration (""Does this tractor look silly with narrow tires and painted pink? Did that trailer have a hitch on the back or not? I'll just look and see!"")- graphics: not a massive leap forward but pretty good upgrade overall, game feels to be running smoother than FS17 too. Big improvements in lighting and atmospheric visuals, you can easily see the difference in the overall image and feel of the game. Beautiful sunsets and night lights :)- audio: a lot of good enviromental sounds, engine sounds stand out much more than in FS17- interface: new interface look, much cleaner, more readable and compactStuff that did not improve (or marginally):- AI Workers: Almost as derpy as always :D, seem to miss less parts of a field on angled edges though- Logging: while the new chainsaw animation is good, it seems 'aiming' the cuts is less intuitive, pieces of wood can still get glitched after cutting (weird collision box and mass) and still missing any sound when a massive tree falls down. Need that satisfying 'creeeeeak-THUD'While the game sure has some issues currently, none are too serious or game-breaking (as far as I've encoutered).";28 November, 2018;

There were 4 of us in the tank, the commander was very communicative and informative. I opened my driver hatch and looked out as the landing craft carrying our Sherman approached the beachhead. The ramp was opening and I closed my hatch to shield myself from the oncoming MG fire from the Germans. We move forward and stop near some Belgian gates to provide cover for the infantry moving up the beachhead. We slowly proceed up to the village and provided fire support for the infantry. Soon, they took the village overlooking Utah Beach and advanced towards the town further inland. We drove forward and stumbled upon an enemy HQ and our gunner blew a bunch of Germans to kingdom come. But they kept on spawning and we ended up wiping out an entire company. It felt like that scene in Band of Brothers when Easy Company ambushed a company of German soldiers and someone shouted: ''Its a whole other company!'' We moved further inland with the infantry (note: we were the only tank the entire team had until the beachhead was secured). But after destroying more Germans, a sneaky kraut with a panzerfaust blew up our tank. It felt like a war story, a story of a Sherman driver and his crew who survived the beaches of Utah and went on to the support the infantry inland but their lives were met short when a mere single German soldier fired his panzerfaust, ending their story right there. So yes, I recommend this game. With enough imagination you can create your own stories by just being a regular grunt or an NCO. I also met some strangers along the way and we added each other as friends! It was a great experience for a free weekend!;24 April, 2020;

Here in Post Scriptum. German Tiger-1 and PzKpfw V. Panthers face off against early Churchills and M4A2 Shermans, sometimes Sherman Fireflys. But not against IS-4's and M48 Patton or M26- Super-Pershings as in mediocre, arcady ww2 shooters.You can play as an Ally (France, Brits, Americans, depending on the scenario) or as German in historical battles like the battle of Market Garden with the equipment and vehicles that were available to the specific faction by that time.Teams(Platoons) are divided in Sections: Infantry, Logistics, Lader and Armored. You can play as an Infantry player and fulfill different roles from a front line medic able to fully heal fallen teammated to MG-Support capable of providing cover fire from a protected location. As a Logistics player, you can drive around the map and construct repair stations, ammunition boxed, fortifications as well as defensive structures and even stationary mortars. As a player of the Armored section, you will dedicate yourself and your squadmates to drive a single tank. Yes, one tank, 4 players. A gunner, A driver, A commander and one who operates the turret/Main Gun. No matter what section or role, in this game, communication is key. You are a soldier, you communicate with your squad to fulfill your tasks.A round of gameplay takes max. 1h, but mostly between 40-50 minutes. During that time, you either try to attack and capture a set amount of bases, or you try to defend them.As Infantry, you die from 2 shots pistol, 1 shot rifle, headshot kills you 100% regardless the weapon, everything else that hits you directly be it a tank shell, a grenade or a mortar round, kills you immediately. You die quick and you kill quick. Just as it would have been in real life. This is not a ""you eat 9 rounds and the enemy eats 10 rounds so you win and survive"" shooter. This is pretty much see first, shoot first.Now to the technical part of the game:You will play with up to 84 players in one lobby,Gun Sounds are freaking awesome!The Graphics are okay but you will struggle seeing anything beyond 600m an let's be honest, this is more than enough in most cases.This game will make you literally ???? your pants when suddenly your location is being bombarded by Ju87 Stuka Attacks or mortar strikes, Realism is a really huge topic in this game.To Wrap it all up: You get an epic, yet pretty hardcore and historically accurate WW2 shooter with combined arms, teamplay, lots of communication. This game offers Great fights, good balancing and is action-packed to the fullest.This game is something for you if:- You like History and are interested in WW2- You like epic realistic battles- You value teamplay- You own a headset/MicrophoneThis game is nothing for you if: - You prefer to play on your own- You don't own a headset- You value your own fun over that of others.- You prefer Arcady shooters like CoD or Battlefield.";26 March, 2020;

I'd suggest reading them and thinking critically about them before a purchase but there are some things that will go a long way to making your first time experience in PS a good one.First, be aware of what you're buying/playing. If you want something very fast paced, and arcadey like BFV or CoD this is likely not the game for you. What PS attempts to do is build a more authentic and tactical war game experience set in WW2 and it succeeds in spades. If you like more thoughtful tactical hardcore shooters like Arma 3 and Squad, then the first time you're pinned down in a trench by mg42 fire while a stuka strafes the nearby road and grenades are going off around your ears as you're trying to understand orders from your squad leader or the platoon commander in fully spatially simulated high-def audio, you'll be hooked. The experience is really unlike any other FPS out there and that's hard to achieve considering how heavily the game is influenced by 'Squad' and it's systems. In the negative reviews you're going to see a smattering of specific things: ""man this game is so good but it's dead"" and probably ""this game sucks, the movement is slow and the maps are too big and its hard to see people and get kills"" and also most likely: ""these devs suck theyre too inconsistent with releases and content and they haven't delivered on everything this game could be."" Personally, I think the game is in a very solid place (especially for this 40% off sale) with more content in the works. The gameplay is _supposed_ to be slower, move slower etc that is by design and finally FWIW: I'm an NA player and I haven't had any trouble finding multiple filled servers any day in the last two weeks.Let's get into what's good and what's bad:Good";7 June, 2019;

What gaming experience you're looking for will determine what game suits you, even though all these milsims seem similar.PS is a good game so far. Nowadays, there are more players so finding a server isn't an issue anymore. I play on English speaking servers so I'm not sure about the other languages. A good WWII mil-sim that doesn't take too long to get into the action. I bought Hell Let Loose (HLL) and can say Post Scriptum (PS) is a more enjoyable and rewarding mil-sim. HLL has more players since it is a more casual game that requires less tactics and communication. HLL is a tad more arcadey in that sense, which brings in more players to HLL than PS because of that arcadey gameplay mentioned. I see HLL as a form of Rising Storm 2: Vietnam sometimes.When compared to Squad, PS has more defined front lines since gamemodes are often Offensive rather than AAS or RAAS. Map design also contributes to the prominence of front lines, where bridges and rivers are more prominent and have objectives on or near them. Mobile Spawn Points in PS increase the pace of the game. In Offensive, the defending team always has a spawn point close to the objective. More importantly, FOBs seem to have an unlimited amount of supplies, which means you can build as much fortifications and emplacements as you wish without having to worry about the MGs or mortars running out of ammo and without having to do frequent logistic truck runs between the FOB and Main Base. This again also increases the pace and puts squads into the action quicker. In PS, your soldier has a canteen to regenerate stamina much quicker. This isn't in Squad either.In the sound department, PS and Squad have an advantage over HLL. In both PS and Squad, firefights are properly loud and have good range and oomph to them. The sound design greatly adds to the realism, especially with good earphones or a decent speaker setup. The sfx in HLL are not quiet, they just don't give that same effect of power and strength, making HLL sound relatively flat. In HLL, tanks and planes sound great with lots of oomph. In PS, everything has oomph.Overall, PS is a highly enjoyable WWII milsim which requires more tactics and communication than HLL. But because of this higher level of dedication required, PS leads itself to more rewarding experiences. The sound design in PS also achieves greater realism and power. As compared to Squad, PS puts players into the fight quicker with less worries of aspects like ammo (supplies), stamina, and spawning far away from the objective (it's less of a walking sim than Squad).Thx for the read gang brother;16 January, 2020;

Easy Red 2;MaximumCapacity;18 products in account;119 people found this review helpful; Recommended 158.7 hrs on record;1 year later updated review (Mar 18 2023): Okay. To most fps gamers, this game seems like trash. But if you observe, this game not only has huge potential, but is really realistic too. I'm going to ignore the fact that this game is all created by one person (with a little help from others), and treat it like a full dev team game.Starting off, the graphics aren't AAA. They are between good and low poly. Helps your game run smoothly tho. There are some good effects here and there, but overall nothing special. The game's gunplay is... Good trash. What I mean by this is there is a lot of recoil, and a **** TON of suppression and sway. For people coming from, say, Battlefield and COD, the gunplay can be very annoying at first.But once you have gotten used to the gunplay, it is very satisfying. In fact, the gunplay in ER2 is very comparable to games like Squad, Hell Let Loose, and other realistic shooters, in the fact that it encourages patient and careful shots. Next, the movement. The movement is an area very similar to basically all FPS games. Theres an infinite sprint, crouching, going prone, etc. Nothing unique. The characters move at a relatively fast speed while sprinting, but you won't feel like Master Chief from Halo.Music in ER2 is not the best. It is pretty calm and is meant to represent the environment the player is fighting in. which is fine, but it can be better. Thankfully, music for a game like ER2 isn't as important as it is for more cinematic games like the Battlefield games and just basically any AAA combat game.Ground Vehicles. This is one area I really feel like ER2 has NO RIGHT TO BE THIS GOOD AT. There are a ton of vehicles, including logistical trucks, jeeps, apcs, tanks, tank destroyers, and even SPGs. As of March 2023, there are over 30 drivable ground vehicles in game, with several others confirmed for the Normandy DLC. I personally am a really big tank fan, and the tank combat in ER2 feels good enough for a game focused mostly around infantry. With that being said, AI bots aren't the best at driving tanks, so that's something to work on for the future.Air Vehicles: This portion isn't as impressive as ground vehicles. Planes mostly feel the same, just with different weapons and loadouts. There are also only around 10 airplanes in game, not counting paratrooper planes and gliders.Again, I want to remind anyone reading this that I am reviewing ER2 like it is made by a dedicated dev team.Maps. Maps in this game are well balanced and are realistic. You can make your own maps (onto that later). The balance between infantry, vehicles, and planes is very good. The variety in the maps is also pretty good. although I think an official Africa map/campaign is needed.Map Editor. Yes, you can make your own maps in this game. It takes time to make a map like all map editors, but compared to those of like Ravenfield this editor is really insane. There are so many props, terrain choices, you can make missions, everything is easy to learn and use. I wont say much more tho, just play the game.Multiplayer. This game is dead. Occasionally I would see an organized event, but the most people I have ever been with on a server is like 20.I mentioned squads. Yes, you serve as the leader or member of a squad of usually 5 people, each with their own inventories and weapons. Like Enlisted.Game modes: Literally like battlefield operations and conquest game modes. That's it.Community and development: The game gets frequent updates, with small content drops here and there. The game's 1.5 devs are very enthusiastic and definitely care about the game. Marco, the man responsible for 99% of the game, is a really passionate guy who listens to the community.The community itself is also very passionate about the game and actively support it. You will find very few toxic people here. I have seen few communities more friendly and caring than this one.Wifi: You don't need wifi to play singleplayer!Overall, Easy Red 2 is an Easy 9.5/10. It is really fun and I rarely get bored. It may look uninspiring and cheap on the surface, but I really think it's a hidden gem among WWII shooters.;18 March, 2022;

Read on.Or do you get offended by anyone even mentioning this travesty and you consider multiplayer against humans 'the only way'. Don't bother going on... Right, so once we have that off our chest lets dig deeper: Who is this game aimed for? There is a huge glut of WW2 games out there, This one is made by one guy, a real indie game but topic is something that has been done SO many times before. Well it's the bots you see, and customization options and workshop extending that make the game. And quite impressive bots they are. Again 'human only' proponents will sneer and find issues right away but in my eyes i have not seen this good bots in a long time if ever. Bots in this game use smoke to blind defender on assault maps, use alternate routes and try to act as group to outflank you. They call artillery on your position to blow up that house you are camping in so that you fall through the floor, grenade you when they get close and come up with all kinds of nastiness when you pop up your badly gunfire suppressed head trying to shoot back at them. The feeling of despair is there when things get tight. Quite a feat in my opinion considering it's bots you are fighting. Day of Defeat games with their simple bots, Battlefield 1942, Vietnam and as game as old as Battlefield 2 left a real gap in my library no game has really been there to fill since then: A game that you can fire up when you want and have a quick custom or workshop modded match against bots. Now here is one that will fill the WW2 niche nicely for quite some time. Not bad for a small indie developer.;28 November, 2022;

NFS Heat had some frustrating aspects to it but overall it was an enjoyable experience. This sequel gets rid of everything that was good about Heat and amplifies everything that was bad.Let's start with tethering: what a joke of a system. I play games to relax, have fun and enjoy the story. The whole purpose of being able to choose your difficulty in a game is to be able to play how you want to play. Not in NFS Unbound. No sir. It doesn't matter if you choose the lowest difficulty setting because the game tethers you to the AI at all times. It doesn't matter how big your lead is. One mistake and you're done.This conveniently leads to my next point: restart limitations. Are you kidding me? So the game is made to be as punishing as possible and we don't even have the option to restart as much as we want anymore? No thank you.Point #3: Your car is tissue paper in every sense of the word. Hit a cop? Nothing happens to him. Hit a racer? Nothing happens to him. Get hit by a cop or a racer? You go flying off the road or spin out of control.Speaking of control: driving at high speed in this game is an absolute joke. The slightest corner makes you lose all control of your car and one of three things usually happens: you hit a wall, you go off the road, you hit a car.What is enjoyable about this game? Really? I am struggling to find a single thing. You get punished for wanting to play casually. You get punished for driving too fast. You get punished for battling with other racers and cops. You get punished for being unlucky and landing on top of a car off of a jump and other random events. Then you get punished for restarting. I don't play games to be punished. I play games to have fun. And this is the most unfun experience I have ever had playing a game. So much so that this is my first time ever returning a game on here.Keep up the great work EA. You're doing a fantastic job.;4 July, 2023;

Yes, since the stages are short and intense there is no sense of loss in progression or waste of time in death, and each time you die you get rewarded with gold used to buy permanent upgrades. So really, no matter what you do and how well (or not) you do it, it feels great to play this game. Highly recommend! :); 13 June;

(Looking at you Stardew!)Pros: Cozy mode is a huge plus. Sincerely, as someone who plays a LOT of survival games and is a bit tired of edgy rugged gameplay, THANK YOU. Works well on older video cards FYI, I'm still rocking a GTX 680 (I know, I know - Christmas maybe) and it plays fine on 60 FPS! Very bright and chill aesthetic. The only 'enemies' are weeds and bugs that can turn into weeds. You craft bug spray to get rid of them, which is kinda genius lolCons: Some clunkiness with the controls - I'm using mouse and keyboard, I think controller support is to come later? - but nothing that would softlock or ruin the overall game experience. Some of the progression pathing isn't obvious (you HAVE to fish in order to unlock some early necessities) but its not hard to figure out & once you get far enough along you're pretty spoiled for resources. One awkward moment where a robot proclaimed her love for me, but she was okay with me letting her down gently. The automation is almost non-existent at this stage (I built the robot but it got stuck almost immediately), so I would love to see more of that/more improvements as the game develops.General Feedback: Would love to see more character customization options because they're quite lacking - hair colours, more styles, skin tones, maybe a different gender?? I feel like the story is following him as a character and not a self-insert like many survival games afford you, but I don't see a reason why he can't be more customizeable or more self-insert, or a she even. Wish I could scrap more things and had more places to go/more places I could explore and interact with, as it feels very limited right now. Would love more world lore about the moon and the main character and their involvement/what happened to them. Would also love to see more accessibility features for my friends that need them, such as controller support, one-handed mode, colourblindness modes, and the ability to disable flashing effects (I don't recall seeing any but just as a note for future). Would also love a weather cycle, a rain collector, solar panels, a way to customize or improve on the sleeping area, and capacitors/batteries would be cool too. Robots that could garden and cook for me would also be swell!Looking forward to seeing what more this game has to offer ?;20 November, 2023;

collectorfull disclosure. i havent finished the game yetobviously the star of the show are the monsters (or monsties if theyre friendly. and im going to use that term going forwards)monsties have base stats, as well as some variance dictated when theyre born (IVs if likening to pokemon)each monstie has a 3x3 gene grid (youll likely have to use consumables to open up the full grid), genes provide passive or active skills (unlike the original. monsties no longer have their own innate movepools. everything they can use is determined completely by genes), they also have an element (or non element) and type (or are typeless. ill get into types when talking about the combat later)... if you match 3 of either element(/non elemental) or type you receive a 'bingo' bonus that provides a damage boost to that respective element or attack type (unlike the previous game you can stack multiple of the same bingo... and unlike the previous game a non elemental bingo increase the damage of non elemental attacks rather than increasing speed)each monstie is hatched with some base genes, theres guaranteed genes but theres also a pool of non guaranteed genes with various rarities that a specific species can hatch with (so dont go hunting kula ya kus for non elemental boost L in the first area because they cant hatch with it)you can move a gene from one monstie to another (the donor gets eaten or runs away or goes to live on a farm... whatever you want thematically. but functionally it gets deleted) using the 'rite of channeling' (this is a feature unlocked in the second village)... if you played the original then theres two key differences. you can move gene locations (previously if a gene was top left on the donor it would only go in the top left slot of the receiver) and you can level up genes by stacking them (up to 3 times. increasing effectiveness)you can trigger an aesthetic change by messing around with genes. you can shift a monsties element if you stack enough to overide its base stats. its colour pallette will shift to reflect the element it was shifted to... functionally however i doubt this will be worth doing, in the original it was only worth doing for non elemental monsties... but with the bingo changes (specifically non elemental bingo) its essentially gimping them for aesthetics (but the option is there if you want it i guess)not every monster in the game is a rideable monstie, theres small monsters like velociprey that arent (because theyre smaller minions of possible monsties. ex velocidrome)... but theres also some 'big' monsters that arent possible monsties (like tetsucabra)... as far as i can tell the whole roster (sans dlc) from the first game made it across to this one, the new additions are mostly monsters that debuted in MH World. the ones that arent are either the fated 4 from generations or variations on the previous roster like bloodbath diablos or dreadqueen rathian). the total count of monsties is supposedly 81 if the monstiepedia is to be believedCombatso theres 4 types of attacksspeed beats powerpower beats technicaltechnical beats speedand then theres typeless attacks that dont interact with that system at allthis rock paper scissors forms a contentious point. and was often used to detract from the first game... which i disagreed with then because monsters (note the terminology. im not talking about monsties) had their own patterns (for example. p.rathian used to have something like 2 speed 1 power 2 speed 1 power pattern. and if you figured that out you could win 100% of head to heads)... monster hunter stories 2 has sort of dumbed that down (atleast as so far as ive gotten)... monsters have a base type (say technical), when they enrage they change their attack type (say to speed)... and rarely monsters have a third change. say inflate into a beach ball (zamtrios) or get charged with electricity where they change to the third type... its a bit simplisticyou have complete control over the protagonist. your monstie on the other hand does what it wants to do... you can wrangle them into using a learned skill on a select target but this will cost some kinship. which is an in battle resource generated through various actions (and when full can be consumed to jump on top of your monstie. which enables powerful kinship attacks). realistically if you know what you're doing then youll essentially have full control at all times thoughfor equipment the player character has a talisman slot (which if you're familiar with mainline monster hunter games. just provides passives), an armour slot (just one. the whole set. which provides defenses as well as more passives... in the first game if your equipment matched your monstie then you received a kinship cost reduction. i havent verified if thats still the case in this one though) and 3 weapon slots (which you can swap to at will in combat)in monster hunter fashion. your equipment is scavenged from the corpses of your enemies (except not really because somehow you can beat a bulldrome. takes its skull... it still gets up and retreats to its den... where you can take its skull again)each weapon is either slashing (greatsword, sword and shield), piercing (bow, gunlance) or blunt (hammer, hunting horn). some monsters/parts are weak/resistant to certain types of weapons... this only extends to riders though and each specific weapon has its own moveset meaning they play a little bit differently. for example hammer and horn are both blunt weapons but where the hammer has skills that benefit from specific ailments on the target or just deal damage. hunting horn has songs in its skills. which provide buffs, debuffs or unique effects (if you're familiar with the mainline monster hunter games the same 'this horn plays these songs' applies) (if you're familiar with the original. hunting horn had a massive rework in that you dont need to 'play' the notes by losing head to heads. you can just play the song outright for kinship cost)you can break monster parts for big monsters. depending on the monster and the part this will have various effects. opening them up for damage, preventing them from using a move, tripping them... but sadly theres no visual indicator of this. if you break pukei pukeis tail it doesnt fall off line in the mainline games. theres no difference in the model. itll just stop it from using a specific attackVisualcharming aesthetic, but graphically lacking, im sure it looks fine on switch but for pc the textures are a bit low quality (some in particular) and theres a very low grass LoDStoryeh, theres some small inconsistencies across the games... also no one seems to bat an eye at the fact that 4 years before this game there was a legendary rider that saved the world from a 'blight' with a rathalos called 'ratha' (MHS1)... but also the MHS2 protags grandfather (called 'Red', which almost seems like a pokemon callout) had a rathalos ALSO called 'ratha' who become a guardian of the starting island (chronologically way before the MHS1 'ratha' but still no connection)... oh and we arent done. for some reason the razewing rathalos the protagonist hatches is also by default called 'ratha'... youd think that one of the multiple characters (including the annoying cat) that spanned both games would atleast mention this... literally no one does (atleast as far as i am in the game)... its not even a placeholder name that you can change. it has to be 'Ratha'... its weird and i cant wrap my head around it... aside from that its a meh story. its not good, its not particularily bad... but its also not why i play these gamesAudiovoice acting is lacklustre at best. it also doesnt help that the english VA doesnt match mouth movements. i switched to japanese VA before eventually turning sound off altogether so i cant really comment on the score other than it wasnt gripping me;11 July, 2021;

Riders and Monsties choose their attacks and opponents. If two participants target each other directly, a Head-to-Head battle is triggered. The winner of the type match-up takes less damage, deals more damage, and negates the opponent's attack. Ties result in both attacks going through normally. Although learning a new monster’s patterns is always engaging, the system can be annoying due to some dumb Monstie and partner AI.You also participate as a Rider, using traditional Hunter weapons to help fight against enemies. There are six types to choose from, each with clear uses. Large monsters have targetable body parts with varying resistances to your weapons. Breaking these parts gives you bonus rewards and may affect the monster’s combat potential.;16 July, 2021;

Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin;Ezplorer;NOT INFORMED;60 people found this review helpful; Recommended 111.7 hrs on record;Some years ago I wanted to play a Monster Hunter game on pc so bad, but I knew that my pc was a potato and it couldn't run Monster Hunter World. So I looked for alternatives, and I found that there was a MH game adapted to Android called Monster Hunter Stories. At first glance the anime style it had kinda put me off, it was very different from the aesthetic of the other MH games that I knew, and it was a turn based game, very different. Nonetheless I gave it chance and it blew my mind, the game was pretty good. I had more fun with that game than I had with any other game of that same style. So I completed it and some time later Monster Hunter Stories 2 was announced. It greatly surprised me that the developers decided to make another game, because I knew that the first one wasn't exactly the greatest hit in terms of sales, although it had a solid fan base. Now that I had the opportunity to play this game I appreciate the developers even more, they improved upon the first game in many ways and added many quality of life features. I really hope that this game sold well enough to see a third part in the future.A quick tip for anyone who wants to play this game: Put the voices in japanese with english subtitles. In my opinion Navirou's voice sounds way better in japanese, also Reverto's voice sounds more badass.Btw, I noticed that the most voted reviews are the ones that complain about a bug the game had, but that bug was patched a long time ago.;24 December, 2023;

The game in it's current state is great but not perfect. Pros: - Relaxing and Cozy- 2-Player Co-op- Cute Art Style- Smooth Performance (I do however own a 3080ti)- Gameplay loop is fun, just like Stardew Valley- Shop and Tourist system is great fun :)- Farming-Sim gamers will love this game- Overall a good game to play with your significant other :) Cons: - No drag and drop system with the inventory system. Very awkward to use. It's not a deal breaker for me but it may be for others.- NPC shops only last from 9am - 12pm in-game. It's too short, in my opinion.- Map UI could use work. I find myself confused sometimes trying to look for buildings since they are not marked on the map only NPCs are. It'd be nice to have icons of every house including the cave, the pier, and the positions of the tourists. - No Auto-Save, from what I know of. You need to sleep in your bed in order to save.- No Widescreen Support.- Using a Controller is very confusing and awkward to use. When I navigate the UI using a controller, I don't even know what I am selecting. Definitely needs work. However, devs have stated that they are working on it. Overall: Spirit of the Island for an early access, in my opinion is in a good state. It is at the very least playable with a good gameplay loop to keep players playing. However, despite all the positives I've mentioned it does struggle in the user interface department as Inventory management is awkward without a drag and drop and the map needs alot of work. At the time of this review, I haven't dug deeper into the mines or deeper into NPC relationships so I will update this review when I reach that phase in-game.

Spirit of the Island;Munchlaxje;NOT INFORMED;41 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 5.2 hrs on record;I've played Spirit of the Islands with my boyfriend for a few hours, and at the beginning we did like the game. There is a lot to explore and art is very cutesty and cozy. The reason I'm not recommending this game is because it is definetly not finished and it feels like it was made in a rush.Firstly I encountered a bug where a tutorial pop-up got stuck on my screen, but managed to resolve it by disabling it. Additionally, there is no inventory space available, except for one player who can obtain extra space early on. Despite playing for five hours, we couldn't find or craft a backpack, which severely limits our ability to collect items.Furthermore, the day and night cycle lacks a smooth transition. Instead of gradually transitioning from day to night like in most games, it abruptly turns dark. This inconsistency disrupts the immersionThe game also lacks clear instructions on obtaining certain items. Even the spirit wiki, doesn't know. Building relationships with villagers doesn't offer any benefits either. Overall, the story and the villagers' interactions are lacking, contributing to the overall sense of the game being hastily put together.I'm disappointed because I thought to have finally found a fun new multiplayer farming game, but unfortunately, Spirit of the Islands falls short of expectations.Edit: forgot to mention, but even if you are hosting, if the person you are playing with leaves the game, you also get kicked out! So be sure to save beforehand!;18 May, 2023;

Spirit of the Island;Misco;502 products in account;28 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 12.9 hrs on record;Ok, so! I play a stupid amount of farming sims. It's my favorite genre. I was really hesitant to get this after reading some of the discussions and comments. I'm glad I decided to go for it. A lot of the things people complain about here and there don't seem to exist as issues anymore.I don't really understand how anyone struggles with inventory management...? Just make chests! You get two full bars of inventory space to start which is more than some games I've played and chests are very cheap/easy to craft. You can put them wherever you want too. If you're familiar with farming sims at all you really shouldn't struggle with anything here. Apparently you can get bigger bags later but I haven't really bothered trying to find anything like that yet. You can save whenever you want and sleep for only a couple of hours or more which is nice for fast forwarding crafting. The graphics are adorable, it feels good on controller, and it runs great on the Steamdeck. I don't know if people are just being nitpicky or if they've patched in some fixes but everything seems good so far.---After playing a few more hours I am absolutely loving this game. Great job devs! I love how the shop works already and I just barely got the first little stand. Here are some things that other games in this genre could learn from you:- Chests can be moved even when they have stuff in them. Crafting stations can also pull from chests which I always love to see. - When turning chests they have a lid animation so you can easily tell what way they're facing. Great attention to detail on this one very thoughtful. - Fishing doesn't make me want to unalive myself- No rush or time gating. The stamina/sleep system is really chill and I'd love to see more devs implement something similar. This set a new standard for me for sleep mechanics in this genre tbh. - Eating/drinking exists but it doesn't feel bad or like a constant chore- It doesn't spend hours drip feeding tools and dragging you through tedious cutscenes. You're given a pretty full kit right up front and the freedom to play with it- Veggies etc rotting doesn't feel great at first but you learn to be careful with what you grow and not to pick things until you're ready to use or sell them. You also get tons of free crop seeds just for smacking grass around so it doesn't feel like a huge loss if you accidentally let something spoil. - If there must be a stamina system, this is a good one. It's forgiving and very easy to manage. I think people were being dramatic or they updated it because town doesn't seem that terribly far and sprinting feels pretty fast.;2 June, 2023;

Darksiders III;Midnight;NOT INFORMED;632 people found this review helpful20 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 3.6 hrs on record;As a fan of the previous two games, I'm really, really, really disappointed.Look, it's no secret that the Darksiders games aren't terribly original when it comes to mechanics. They're pretty derivative of whatever's popular in 3rd-person hack n' slash gaming at a particular moment. But this one is shameless. It doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's a blatant ripoff of Dark Souls: you have a rechargeable health restoration item, the souls currency from other games is now lost upon player death and potentially retrievable upon getting back to where you died, checkpoints are sparse and never near the boss encounter, enemies all respawn upon player death, leveling up grants you attribute points, random low-level mooks can easily kill you.And it's that last one that really drives me crazy. Fury is preposterously weak in this game. 2-3 hits from a random mob guy and you're dead. The big, scary horseman of the apocalypse is knocked down by a random baddie with no effort. War and Death could be taken down if you weren't careful, sure, but you had to be sloppy. You had to really let the fight get out of hand, or be in a uniquely difficult fight. But because the devs were dead-set on trying to be Dark Souls, a series that has nothing in common with this franchise, they've decided that you need to be ground down into the pavement at the first suggestion of an injury. It's completely out of step with Darksiders I and II.And the only real way to mitigate these butt-whoopings is with a perfectly timed dodge. That's the central mechanic of all combats, and something you should review in advance if possible when deciding if this game is for you. There's no block, you have no health, and spamming dodge will get you killed more often than not. The whole game rests upon you dodging at EXACTLY the right moment and then countering. That's it. Which could've worked, perhaps, if the game had been built around that idea, but it's not. It's so at odds with the rest of the gameplay that it's frankly kind of startling, like they really did just piece mechanics together without considering the whole. You fight multiple mobs in spaces that are usually confined, hanging over precipices, and/or littered with obstacles, making the all-important dodge mechanic awkward at best and frequently hazardous. On top of that, the game is also inexplicably built around one-on-one targeting like a classic Zelda game. it's the only way to (a) see an enemy's health and (b) deliver the counterattack that goes with the aforementioned dodge. So you spend fights trying to target individual enemies out of large crowds, meaning that enemies you can't see are beating you over the head and killing you within moments. Your attacks don't interrupt or stun enemies often enough for effective crowd control, and you can't tell how you're doing against any of them unless you start individually targeting to see one (1) enemy's health.This game is a mess. Dark Souls is a terrible, terrible source of inspiration for this series. the sensibilities of the former simply don't fit the latter. The result is an awkward, frustrating mishmash of solo fighting and mob fighting that enables the worst of both.;6 March, 2019;

Darksiders 3 feels like a combination of Darksiders 1 and Dark Souls, it brings out a bit of a more serious combat, and the boss fights (On Apocalyptic) can get a bit intense, but once you learn the patterns of enemies and bosses, you'll manage to make your way forward.The game doesn't hold your hand so you will have to navigate on your own and find the way to go. You'll end up exploring more and finding future portals which you have to return to later in the game. The game has more of the same weapon feel as the first game where as you have a set of weapons that you can switch between and upgrade with materials you find in the wilderness. You can also make them better by putting on enchantments. The graphics are good and they manage to keep the same art style as from the earlier games.;2 December, 2018;

Darksiders III;KRAUSER-SAMA;785 products in account;495 people found this review helpful16 people found this review funny; Recommended 18.1 hrs on record;The Short of it Pros:+A game for Darksiders fans+Incredibly fluid, fair combat+Beautiful environments adhering to the DS style+Well optimizedCons:-Poor navigation in a fairly linear world More In-depth +Story (Minimal Spoiler): 6, 6 long years since the sequel of Darksiders was released, and today we finally get to meet the third horseman, Fury. I’ll keep the main plot short as I’m sure most of those reading are aware, but with balance in disarray your task is to defeat the seven deadly sins who are on the loose on Earth. However, this section is not meant to reiterate information, the main question I want to answer is, “Do I need to have played the earlier games to play this one?” The answer, strictly speaking is no, but I would highly recommend at least knowing what occurred in the first two entries of the series (especially considering the ending of the game). While playing 3 on its own is certainly possible, you will definitely derive the most enjoyment understanding exactly what is going on in the world. With that said, I’m sure fellow fans of the franchise who know what’s going can be excited to see their long awaited continuation.For those more curious on the story itself, it is serviceable to say the least, it’s not really until you reach towards the end of the game where you’ll have a few “whoa” moments.+Gameplay (Controller used):I’m just addressing this now, this is NOT a simple hack and slash game where all you need to do is mash attack (unless maybe on the easiest setting, but even then there is some dodging involved). This is an action RPG, like that of Dark Souls, in terms of its combat. If all you do is attack, you will die, not your kind of game? I suggest that this may not be the game for you then. The game plays very closely to others of its genre, focusing mostly on hitting and dodging anything that so much as breathes the wrong way. Darksiders 3 is the kind of game that’s “more of the same”. Truthfully, while the game is enjoyable, it also doesn’t do anything in particular to stand out from other titles. You have your attacks, dodging, and assortment of special abilities you obtain throughout the game that really only serve the main purpose of traversing new platforming challenges or obstacles meant to wall you off early, fairly standard.I’ll also be making a point that this entry is much closer to the first Darksiders rather than the second, since depending on which side you lie you may not like the third game. I say this in the sense of how progression occurs because in Darksiders 2 there was an added in-depth loot system as well as shops to buy and equip different armors and weapons. That is no longer the case with the third entry, this could either mean something to you, or nothing, the decision is yours on what it means.+Graphics/Visuals:One of the things I’ve always liked about Darksiders is the way it looks. From the combat to the characters to the world itself, everything looks fantastic. Of course, with this being the third game, you’re looking at a significant upgrade from the second game. The only thing others could complain about in my mind is that maybe the game could’ve aimed higher aesthetically, but I would only agree to this if it is not at the expense of the game’s unique art style. Case and point, game looks and feels great.+Optimization:With some games these days releasing as less than well optimized, I’m proud to say that Darksiders 3 does very well in maintaining its FPS. Since this was over the Thanksgiving weekend I didn’t have my 1080 setup on me and played the game using a 970m laptop. While I did experience a few frame drops, I was playing at a very consistent high 40s - 50s frame rate on medium high settings. So even if you don’t have the greatest computer in the world, Darksiders 3 ought to be one you can enjoy without worry.-Navigation:The only real complaint is how the world, while beautiful, is laid out, and how you’re supposed to navigate through it. Let’s start with the fact that there is no map… yes, no map. I’m personally not too sure why this of all things would be changed when both previous entries used a map. In Darksiders 3 you only have a compass that will point you in the direction of the closest sin. This makes it very easy to look in the wrong places.This coupled with the fact that the game is fairly linear makes for a somewhat frustrating combination to say the least. While the compass can lay out more than one sin to you, the natural paths you end up taking (one reason being because the other paths are closed off to you at that point in the game) almost naturally make it so that you beat specific ones at certain times (specific sins will award you with a new ability). Now I can hear you, “if it’s linear on a natural path then how are you complaining about navigation”? I found myself at multiple points held up thinking, maybe I simply don’t have the ability necessary to reach that location. But upon several backtracks it’s because I missed a very simple, though easy to miss, turn or room (that I otherwise believed had already been checked out). This is how the compass misled me, it will point “directly” at the sin, but with a general map I could see a tunnel or passage that I may have missed without having to look throughout an entire floor more than once. In addition to that point on sins, you can hypothetically intentionally skip a certain sin or two (it’s pretty obvious by the area that they are close by, or sometimes dialogue occurs) after about 4 hours as that's when you begin to have more freedom to explore, but that’s more trouble than it’s worth.Plus, it’s not always a “natural path” as I stated earlier, you’re in a fairly vast environment, and me being the explorer that I am, end up going routes that aren’t even likely to take me to my destination. Adding a minor point with that, vast majority of other places you can go to are often just for resources meant to upgrade your arsenal (damage buffs and such). Very few “secrets” are really out there in the world. Conclusion If you’re a starving Darksiders fan, then this is the Darksiders game you’ve been waiting for. However, others who aren’t exactly diehards for the franchise may feel differently, and understandably so based on the information I’ve provided. If you’re, for example, only interested in the genre itself, there are many other titles to consider for less, and have their own little twists to it on gameplay. Or you could consider some of the earlier entries of the series to see if the lore, combat, or art are game changers for you. In the end, despite the game’s poor sense of direction and rather linear story, the game remains incredibly enjoyable with its fast-paced combat and continuation of the Darksiders saga.This product was reviewed with a key provided by the Publisher(s).Follow our curator page, OCG-Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.;27 November, 2018;

I understand why some people are upset about the game, since it differs from the previous games in some areas and utilizes some mechanics that are known for being ""Souls-like"". But I think people are being too harsh on the game beucase it still emphasizes on exploration, combat and metroidvania-like level design. The story and the writing is as good as ever and the environments look beautiful.People should realize that this game was made after the original company went bankrupt, and THQ Nordic is not that big of a company right now, they're in the process so they shouldn't expect a top quality title with AAA features.The combat is more focused on 1-1 fights and as soon as you are fighting with multiple enemies, you're in grave danger (I've played the game on the Apocalyptic diffiulty). Dodging is very important and I didn't really have problems with the dodge window, contrary to what people complain about.Later in the game, I've experienced frame dips and stutters but nothing that made me want to stop playing.In the end, I've highly enjoyed my time with Darksiders III, even more so than I did with the first one.

Darksiders III;mark;NOT INFORMED;59 people found this review helpful; Recommended 14.1 hrs on record;If you’ve played Darksiders III then you most likely have played the first and second one as well. Like the second one Darksiders III opts to do things a little differently and in my opinion it succeeds, but not on all fronts.While the first one was a great Zelda clone and the second one even bigger with an entire open world and a loot system, this third one scales things back a little, this time choosing to be a little more like a Dark Souls game instead. You can tell that Darksiders didn’t do as well as a franchise and therefore the funding seems to have been decreased this time in comparison to the previous titles, but I commend them for trying something different with the obviously smaller budget they had.Calling it a Dark Souls clone would do it injustice - and it would be disrespectful - because it is its own game, set in the Darksiders universe, complete with unlockable moves, hidden loot and well known traditional visual style (this time playing as Fury). It all feels like an actual Darksiders game, except with harder, sometimes even frustrating, combat. But gone are the dungeons of old, as is your mount from the second game and some other small stuff.Traveling through the world feels responsive and all of the areas seem to be well connected, with a boss fight at the end of each area and plenty of items to be found. There’s a bit of (optional) backtracking involved so it still has a little bit of a Metroidvania blueprint in it.Better equipment can be found and unlocked and you have a whip at your disposal when you first start the game. There’s nothing that helps you block damage, instead you have to rely on dodging and trying to finish the fights as quickly as possible (but it isn’t necessary if you don’t want to). Enemies will drop souls that help you level and power up and if you die there’s one more try to retrieve them. die again and they’re forever lost.The boss fights can be difficult, but never as hard as Dark Souls’. With controls that can be changed (one of the first patches gave this option, because sometimes the original movement and layout didn’t quite work as good) and plenty of items that can help in combat it might take you a few tries to take one down, but generally speaking it shouldn’t take you over 5 tries or so.Finishing the game should take you anywhere between 12 and 15 hours I’d say.The visuals of the game aren’t brilliant, but they fit the style of the Darksiders games for sure. Fury seems be nicely animated.The voice acting is also solid, with a few enemies here and there speaking in an over-the-top manner, but also making it seem more like a spectacle than it actually is in the process, which is a positive.I didn’t really have any issues, except for a few issues where the camera didn’t do what it was told. And the controls which were a little weirder in comparison to 1 and 2, but that issue was quickly solved with a patch.The big question is: would I recommend this third Darksiders game? Yes. The combat may be hard(er), but it’s also quite enjoyable once you get into the flow of the game. It’s a smaller, tighter game in comparison to the previous titles, but that doesn’t make it any worse. In fact, it was kind of refreshing to play something a little more direct, a little more linear, after all of these open world games the past couple of months and years.If you enjoyed this review please consider following me: curator page;12 September, 2021;

Last Epoch;Yeetloaf;105 products in account;481 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 232.7 hrs on record;"So I bought this for myself last week as an avid ARPG enthusiast with well over 2000 hours on Path of Exile and god knows how long on D2 back in the day, I blink, and 50 hours have passed. This game shows phenomenal promise, the devs are super active and pumping out content and fixes at a rapid rate and have been faithfully following the roadmap plan.Last Epoch is far easier to get into than PoE, with a much more approachable passive and active skill system. Every weapon type can be used by every class which allows for some juicy build diversity, there's plenty of synergy between skills and passives and all upgrade points feel rewarding with a satisfying bump in power. Let's go over some pro's:- Tons and tons of character customisation, got all the basic equipment, rings, belts, amulets and idols, a neat item that provide powerful buffs to stats. A 4x4 grid is provided to arrange idols in whatever way you want, with smaller idols providing smaller or more generic buffs such as flat health or a small % increase to fire damage, and larger idols providing big specific buffs such as % lightning damage but the value is doubled if you have over 300 max mana. These idols allow for a lot of extra customisation. - Enjoyable story campaign with good voice acting on top, granted the story isn't fully completed yet but I had fun! Time travel, cosmic horror, many biomes and environments, immortal emperors and imperious gods! What's not to like?- Telegraphed enemy attacks!!! Words cannot describe how gratifying it is to see where the massive void bomb thrown at you is actually going to land, allowing you to dodge or time your defensive abilities accordingly. And if/when you do die, there's a death screen showing you what attack you died to and what damage type/s that attack dealt.- An approachable deterministic crafting system is something PoE has been crying out for, and thankfully LE provides. Yes it does still require some luck, but basically how it works is thus. you find affix shards all over the place as a lootable ground item which provide a single use ""craft"" to forge onto an item or to improve an existing roll. Every possible affix can drop as a shard, or you can shatter an item with an affix you want to apply to another item and get a random amount of shards back from all the affixes on the shattered item. It's easy to play around with, and shards fly out of mobs and barrels so there's plenty to experiment with! The highest tier rolls (T7) are drop only, with item forging allowing a maximum affix tier of 5 so you can't fully power a basic roll therefore keeping loot valuable late-game. Fracturing an item prevents it from being modified anymore, and can even lower your affix tiers so it's basically a game of chicken if you want to upgrade your item more and more.- The Monolith of Fate is a solid endgame grind, allowing you to unlock permanent character upgrades upon completing the mini quest lines contained with each Monolith stage. Endless Arena keys can drop from the Monolith loot chest allowing you to challenge the appropriately named Endless Arena against waves of mobs providing a good chunk of xp.- Advanced affix descriptions provide a description of an affix, for example ""chance to inflict shock"" is a possible item affix, and if you hold ""alt"" while hovering over the item it will tell you exactly what shock does. All the defensive mechanics show the maths behind them. Basically the game is exceptionally well explained! - Level setting, backgrounds and atmosphere are top-notch and the End of Time ""town"" has a freaking black hole in the background which is cool as ????.Consequentially there are some cons:- Gold isn't particularly useful yet, and items aren't worth picking up to sell as you get plenty from it dropping from mobs and breakables. However I imagine when the bazaar is introduced and allows player trading it will become much more useful!- You can't modify uniques or set items which can be annoying if you get one with low rolls or implicits.- While the game does run well generally, some skills and enemy attacks do slow the framerate down particularly the big screen size ones that can be used repeatedly. - No random terrain generation, as in if you run ""shining cove"" multiple times, the zone layout is the same every time. Personally I don't mind this but it could get a bit same-y doing the same layout over again.Overall, Last Epoch has incredible potential and is already a super fun ARPG with a good story, great itemisation, satisfying character upgrades through levelling and item upgrades and a great dev team who deserve your support. Give it a shot, as if Last Epoch is kept true to form and continually supported I can see it challenging Grim Dawn, Torchlight, Diablo and hell even Path of Exile!";2 March, 2021;

Really enjoyed the journey and was extremely satisfied with my time spent in The Last Faith. There are a ton of really sick weapons depending on how you want to play, but after I found my big greatsword I stuck with that! The firearms are cool and the custom executions were awesome as well. The world feels huge and with there not being a linear path, you can end up in areas that you are not supposed to be in yet. Being able to mark on your map where items/doors/locations are that you need to backtrack to is a great quality of life feature. There is a nice variety of magic spells to play with as well. If you enjoy creepy NPCs with their own questlines, plenty of hidden areas to uncover, and an awesome art style. then you’ll love exploring this game. I’m a big fan of the dark atmosphere this game has, kind of reminds me of Bloodborne/Castlevania. Once you get your character to the right level and keep your weapon leveled, the bosses aren’t as big of a challenge. With that said, I loved the design of every boss, especially the hidden ones. There are achievements that you can get locked out of if you progress the story too far without meeting questline requirements but a lot of the cheevos come naturally. In the future, an NG+ feature would be a great addition to wrap up any missed achievements that you miss.

The Last Faith;Im;NOT INFORMED;88 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 47.8 hrs on record;I'm very surprised at how high quality this game is compared to the reception behind it. I've been seeing reviews with the oddest complaints.Similar to Blasphemous? Not really. In Blasphemous you have one character that has a pretty linear leveling path.Last Faith has a wide variety of builds and tons of different weapons with a variety of different scaling options to suit your play style. I immediately booted the game up again upon beating it to try a whole new play style. My first run was a Dex/Mind spell blade who meshes awesome spells in with melee. Now I'm playing a Str/Instinct hybrid and trying other weapons and strategies.Then there's the gfx looking similar. Yes, when you have a game that is going for a certain style it will look like another. No one says anything when it comes to 3D assets in games always looking similar but for some reason people get more fussy when it's pixels. It's a style, and it doesn't belong to Blasphemous.People complaining about clunky combat... What? Are we playing the same game? I was doing all sorts of attack cancels, rolls, weaving spells into my combos and all manners of wild and cool stuff between spells, guns, and weapons. Are people just maxing strength, swinging the big sword and then saying combat is boring? Obviously it's going to be boring when you approach it that way.The game is also nonlinear. I managed tool explore a whole part of the game while missing out on an entirely different spot only to find it later. The game does reward exploration and there's plenty of it.The music is very good, the save room theme haunts me in my sleep... In a good way. The set pieces that accompany the locales in this game also set the mood perfectly alongside the variety of areas to explore. Some idiot on IGN said everything is a house or a city? That guy is an idiot and probably only played for 2 hours.Theres a swamp, icy caverns, moody churches, a mansion of mirrors, a sprawling Gothic city and more. This game is very pleasant to the eye and a joy to explore.Wanna know what my complaints are? Enemy variety. Not even a huge deal, should've had a few more pallete swap enemies though (here's a enemy design philosophy you could've stole from Blasphemous lol). It was annoying to always see those homeless dudes with the knife charging at me in like every area past the ice cavern. Maybe have like elemental versions of this enemy, have different elements and colors form more enemies. Def can be implemented just use the hue slider in photo shop to change their colors and add some elements to their attacks.But the enemies and bosses especially are all well designed and fun to fight, just wish there was a bit more variety sometimes with some specific fodder types.Other complaint, please put a mark on the map for lost exp. It wasn't hard for me to mark the spot myself, but this is a standard QoL feature that should be here too.Other than that, this game kicks ass.It's not Blasphemous, it's The Last Faith... Amen. PS: I love Blasphemous too, but stop acting like this isn't a gem too just because they both exist in the same space.;20 November, 2023;
The Last Faith;Danmit;2,180 products in account;122 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 28.2 hrs on record;Great art, below average gameplay.Blasphemous (1) is the most obvious point of comparison - clunkier Symphony of the Night-style combat and platforming in a grimdark setting with some light soulslike influences like committing to attack animations and losing your held cash/xp on dying twice in a row. The combat and platforming both feel slightly subpar for the genre - there is significant input delay or turn delay that often prevents quickly turning around and attacking from targeting the right direction, animations do not transition into each other (e.g. charged attacks do not combo into standard attacks), and ledge grabs are finnicky. The movement/exploration upgrades I've found so far have been the most boring of bog-standard metroidvania standbys- things like the ability to push boxes, walljump from specific and rare wall textures, or grapple to specific and rare hooks. In the best metroidvanias, the movement upgrades that gate area progression are all applicable to multiple scenarios: enabling previously impossible progression, improving speed/ease of general platforming while backtracking, and shaking up combat either by providing more ways to positionally respond to enemy actions or by having damaging/debuffing effects. So far, these upgrades have no possible use in either general platforming or combat. Like Blasphemous, there are creative and satisfying execution animations, which seem to be unique for every enemy. Also like Blasphemous, unfortunately, whether these can be triggered seems to be strictly down to an RNG call when an enemy is at low HP rather than as a reward for good play, and having too much damage can render them impossible to trigger for an enemy type, which is a huge shame. Weapon special attacks and spells are both cool, but the mana costs are often too prohibitive to fully incorporate them into combat because there's no mechanic for mana recovery apart from from resting at a checkpoint or using consumable items.The game isn't a soulslike metroidvania (e.g. Salt & Sanctuary, Grime, Unworthy, Death's Gambit), but it does take a bit more influence than Blasphemous. For example, you can level to dump points into various stats - HP, mana, str/dex, etc. Unfortunately, not all the influences it takes are good things, even for fans of both genres. The game starts with a class selection that determines your initial stats, but oddly classes don't come with a set of class-essential equipment, like a weapon scaling with your primary stat, a spell for mage classes, or a gun for the marksman class. Cribbing the Dark Souls model for weapon upgrades makes weapon variety illusory, as you'll be locked into whichever weapon you first start upgrading both in the short-term by the fact that newly-discovered weapons would require a significant cash/xp investment to perform well enough to be worth genuinely trying and long-term by the fact that the materials required for weapon upgrades are highly limited. As in soulslikes, rolling gives i-frames - sort of. Most projectiles and certain melee attacks ignore i-frames, and this isn't tied to another system (e.g. the way that some attacks are unblockable or unrollable in Sekiro or Lies of P) or even visually communicated to the player. You'll just be occasionally shocked that your roll did nothing for you and have to memorize that particular enemy attack animation ignores the system. Worst of all, it doesn't take the Dark Souls approach to healing (making a fixed, usually upgradable amount of healing available after every checkpoint use) or influence from the smart approaches of some modern metroidvanias, like the way Hollow Knight and its followers tie the availability of healing to combat performance or others make healing freely available when out of combat. Even old-school metroidvanias like SotN handled healing better by ensuring that (respawning!) healing power-ups were adequately available throughout the levels themselves. Instead, healing in The Last Faith comes in the form of consumable items, a la Demon's Souls/Bloodborne, which can be found as one-time drops in levels, on rare occasions as random drops from enemies, or purchased from some vendors. This means that if you run low, viable exploration range will suddenly and massively drop and bosses will become unbalanced, and rote grinding is the only way to fix it. The bosses I've seen haven't been particularly hard, but that's a concerning problem to see in a genre where learning difficult boss patterns across multiple attempts is a core philosophy. The same is true of bullets, if your build/playstyle incorporates a ranged weapon.Like Blasphemous, this game is carried by its strong visuals and strong art direction, and it's not bad so far, but it's mechanically weak enough that I can't give it a general recommendation in this state. If the art really appeals to you, you'll be able to get past the frustrations and price-point and have a good enough time, but it doesn't seem stand out as either a unique or a well-executed example of the genre from what I've seen.;16 November, 2023;

Worth it on sale if you're curious but I wouldn't pay full priceGood Stuff=======================- The pixel art is really beautiful and it is at least on par with it's main competitor Blasphemous- The visual themes of the different sections of the game are similarly lovely to look at and the designers have done a wonderful job of making it feel like a living, breathing world.-You certainly get a lot of bang for your buck, I couldn't stomach more then 11 hours but I'm betting it would be 15-20 for 100% I just stopped caring.Bad Stuff===================- Ok so the biggest sin: Your character controls like complete trash. You are slow, your dodges almost seem like rolling the dice, you turn like a 16 wheeler, and none of that becomes evident until the mid game bosses where staying mobile is the best way to approach large encounters. The worst part is that you get a transformation later on that makes movement and combat more dynamic and fun but it only lasts for a few seconds in combat.- The enemies are perhaps, the most frustrating I've encountered in a game recently. They have large health pools that just continue to grow through the game, making it so that you'll never really feel like you've made progress leveling or improving your weapon. They will almost all have homing projectiles or ways to hit you without risking themselves or they have tracking to be able to completely 180 mid swing and the worst part? So many of them deal damage on death by exploding, lighting themselves on fire, shooting icicles etc. combat becomes: Engage group of enemies, kill one, back away to let it explode, repeat. Makes the flow of combat in the mid to late game awful.- Ledges are really more of a dice roll, sometimes you'll grab them, sometimes you won't. Especially fun over instant death pits.- While the sprite work is fantastic, it is criminally overused, you will be fighting the same enemies the entire game with larger and larger health and damage pools. Sometimes you'll get palette swap characters and new areas do have 1 or 2 new enemies but it gets old quickly.- The fast travel system has a ?????? UI, please just let me move my cursor around the map freely to pick the point I want to go to as opposed to locking me in place.- The sidequests are just bad. Usually you'll have to find an item for an NPC, they'll thank you and vanish. No aftermath and sometimes not even an item, it's weird and makes the whole process forgettable.- The late game areas put little traps everywhere. Icicles that explode when you hit them, powder kegs that explode too, stalactites that fall from the ceiling. Couple this with the exploding enemy deaths I mentioned before and it just feels awful- Even at very high level your character is incredibly fragile because there is no hit stun. Basically there's no period of immunity so things like this happen:Engage bomb throwing enemy and melee enemy. Kill bomb thrower with 2 swings, he drops 3 bomb on the spot where he dies and one bomb in front and behind himMelee enemy hits me during this, I fall backwards into a dropped bomb that explodesI am thrown forward by the explosion and into the spot where the bomber died3 bomb explosions do most of my healthMelee enemy kills me with a follow upLike a 1 second immunity would be so helpful here to make the process more manageable.- Really the game isn't bad/hard but the above choices make it so ?????????? tedious, I was ready to be done by the end of it."; 27 March;

Loved playing it with friends. Had the perfect balance of difficulty, fun and well, balance.Now, the game has been bastardized and everything about it changed for the worst. Not only that, the dev himself on Discord treats anybody who doesn't like something he put into the game like they are the scum of the Earth. He acts like his game is perfection and anybody who doesn't agree is an idiot. He's been shoving DLC down our throats with no improvement to the overall quality of the game. With every DLC and update, the game gets worse. It continuously drifts further away from what it used to be. The dev truly took something awesome. Something great. Took it and threw it in a dumpster inferno and just disrespected it and everybody else. Steam is where the majority of the dev's sales comes from. He vehemently refuses to work on a mobile port for the game because it doesn't sell as well as the steam version, meaning his threw all of his eggs into a single basket because he thinks it's the only place worthy of his game existing. All he cares about is money.His 2.0 update was met with overwhelmingly negative feedback all over the internet and he says everybody is wrong and that 2.0 is an upgrade and improvement to the game. The only people he treats nicely are the blind white knights that valiantly defend him and praise his updates. People lost hundreds of hours of progress. Saves completely wiped out. Everybody had to start from scratch. I used to play this game in offline mode on the go with my laptop, Steam doesn't count those hours, at least, they used to never do that 10 years ago. I had a couple hundred hours myself, uploaded my save to the cloud from that time. It's completely gone. All of my progress. All of my unlocks. Everything. And I'm expected to start over from scratch with a severely inferior version of the game. You have to repurchase all of the DLCs and all of the unlocks in the game to have access to everything again at the detriment of having to play the not so new and ""improved"" version of the game.The community has fought tooth and nail with the dev on how to improve the game and he disregards the feedback, insults people, acts childish, or turns on his blinders. Or all of the above. You can see how he acts in the Steam Discussion Board. Remember all those other studios and developers that actively speak out against their community? How they got burned so hard that they effectively killed their games? Yeah, that's what's happening here. The cycle repeats itself and the dev is experiencing it first hand and doesn't even see it because he only wants to see what he wants and not the truth. Now, he claims he's been planning on bringing the old game back as a ""game mode"" of all things instead of just calling it ""Hero Siege Classic"" or something and retaining everything the old game originally was. This sounds great for everybody on paper, but, considering the history of the dev's actions, let's just say, I don't have hope for this whatsoever. His track record so far from what I've witnessed over the years of lurking is the farthest thing from trustworthy. All he had to do was do NOTHING with the game. Everything he's done with the game should have been listed as a sequel title instead of transforming and disfiguring the entirety of the game. The dev essentially did the same thing that happened with Infinity Wars. Instead of just making a second game, they completely destroyed their original game. Not understanding just how bad of an idea that was and just how much support they lost and how hard they burned everybody. Never to get back the game's rightful glory.Also, apparently, the dev has been treating this game as if it's a live service. It's advertised as a single player game that can be played offline and offers local coop. The epitome of a ""do whatever the f you want with the game"". Yet, people who want to edit some kind of value in the game or use Cheat Engine to skip a lot of the absurdity this game has involved with it"; 14 June;

Alot of improvements came with the upgrade and Unstable Branch, has a much smoother feel overall. I will list the positives and negatives and my personal thoughts. *** POSITIVES ***1. Very Relaxing and chill game.2. The animals are thought out well, you actually have to care for them in order for them to become healthy.3. Alot of fun and different ways to make money. 4. Graphics with the Unreal 5 update are awesome. 5. Crops are very thought out as well, takes time, and care to get the best healthy yield. 6. Very stressfree, no hard or painful puzzles or quests. 7. Allows you to actually run your own Ranch and interact on a personal level with the animals and land. 8. Much better and more personal than farming simulator in my opinion.9. Different Stores and Sell Points depending on the items you want or the items you are trying to sell. *** NEGATIVES ***1. Vehicle Handling is absolutely horrible, every vehicle almost feels it is on ice skates. 2. Small Trailer slides from side to side like its literally on ice and that causes you to loose control and wreck sometimes. 3. All trailers have similar issues. 4. Wild Animals act as though they have severe ADHD. Very predictable and spawn in generally the same areas. 5. Map is very small6. Tree cutting animations are very simplistic. 7. Economy is mildly broken and fixed.8. Limited amount of Vehicles and Trailers. 9. Hunting Rifle which I assume since it shares the same Caliber as the Revolver is a Henry 357 Lever Action has a very weird First Person animation.10. Some of the movement seems buggy at times. For example when you are trying to pick up eggs or clean up chicken poo your character sometimes does a shuffle dance when your trying to focus in on the object. *** MY SUGGESTIONS ***1. Re-work Vehicle handling metas2. Re-work Trailer handling metas3. Add additional Vehicles/ Trailers 4. Smooth out Player Movements5. Fix the very dark lighting inside some of the stores6. Total Overhaul and re-work of economy. Prices should fluctuate off of simulated supply and demand.;30 October, 2023;

It had high hopes and loads of potential. However, it is STILL as janky as day one. Everything negative about it is true. Vehicles don't have the drag on the road they should, they swerve violently for no reason. Gods forbid you hit a rock or bump. You get launched into space. It feels like an early 90's racing game, and not the good ones. Exiting vehicles will eject you across the map like you're team Rocket, for some reason. Chickens get stuck on a single piece of poop, and die from dehydration, or worse have an obsession with standing on the water trough, and THEN die of dehydration... Moving them manually can help, except they route right back to some state of stuck. There's no late game content, so you will be bored. You have cheese making, but you can't add anything besides an egg or a meatball to it(WTF????). No yogurt, no butter, no pasteurization. No selling it to a bottling plant under contract. You have gardening, but you can't do anything with it. I think you can feed lettuce to the pigs, but not the chickens... You sell everything directly to a fast food restaurant, not a grocer, not at a weekend farmer's market, but a one-off Burger King looking place. A lot of the mechanics feel like they were shoe-horned into the game without considering purpose or scope. Things need to have a purpose and make sense, not just existing because filler. Getting KO'd by a bear is fine, BUT not by the hardware store. Hunting is a filler also. It needs overhauled, you either kill it or it kills you. Except the deer blocking the road and holding up traffic for in-game hours. And WHY is the town so spread out? And as a ranch sim, there isn't a lot of RANCH animals to choose from. No sheep, no poultry besides chicken, no deer farming, no bison, no rabbits. Just pigs, cows, and goats. And no varieties that have different functions, except the cows. There's no annual fair to take your animals to for showing/judging. There's a lot that should be overhauled with this game as QoL updates. There's also a lot of systems that just still feel unfinished, and broken even. So as much as I want to recommend this game, I cannot.

It has hunting of deer, bears and coyotes. It is relaxing and grindy. You have to hunt to make money to take care of what you have. It is not perfect. There are a ton of bugs we've found, but it is in Early Access so that is to be expected. Some of the bugs: - Auto feeders do not work on the barn- Auto feeder in deluxe coop is not there like it says in the building menu- Truck went missing for a day and then returned randomly- Lights in the house will not stay on- The well says I can build it even though its already there because my husband built itThings I would love to see put in the game:- Fishing- More hunting animals- Some sort of color blind mode (seeing the animals and poop are nearly impossible)- Meters showing food, water and levels of milk in barrels- Better driving mechanics and about a million less rocks and invisible walls- More explanation (like what are the records I keep finding for?)- Outdoor Lights- House decoration- Farming Overall, the game is relaxing and enjoyable to play with someone. Grinding the money to keep expanding is enjoyable to me. The hunting is fairly simple (although stacking the meat is a pain). Caring for animals is fun.

Ranch Simulator: Farm, Build, Hunt;Meese;NOT INFORMED;70 people found this review helpful; Recommended 155.6 hrs on record;As I'm writing this, the game is in Early Access Version s0.613s.People should keep that in mind and it's not necessarily a bad thing: Early Access by a small team, and despite that it's already remarkable what they managed to create.I have had this game for a week now and have been playing it almost every day with a friend and solo. A big plus right from the start was the character creator, it's always fun to play with an individual character. The Ranch itself gives you all the freedom to build whatever and wherever you want on your property!So far the Game has chickens, cows, pigs and horses. Again, you have the opportunity to create the Ranch you desire, no forcing you to take care of animals you don't wish to have. You can sell so many products, from eggs, sausages and variations of cheese and more. I appreciate how much detail went into this, it doesn't get boring and is very rewarding to manage the Ranch.The animals look very good, honestly, I have seen much worse models used in bigger games. They move realistically and roam around. For instance, some of our chickens always walk around in the pen, others have their preferred spots to sit inside the coop. pretty cute. I'm impressed with how nice the horses move and manoeuvre. Overall, there are many lovely details that make this such a delight to play. You can tell that it's Early Access, of course, but you can also see that the team put a lot of thought and work into it!Not dragging you along a storyline and forcing you to buy/build things you might want to different is refreshing. You can choose how busy you want to be in this game, and I'm really looking forward to what's planned for this as of now. Variety, creativity and freedom to play your way in a pretty environment with game mechanics that are nothing but supportive is just chef's kiss.Negative aspects for me personally are: The driving controls are quite wonky, you can get almost used to it. Still, not that annoying because even when you crash you can just flip the car, and you never lose the things you're transporting. Also, the stones in the ground make you crash hard, there is no driving across them.Hunting is a nice change of pace, but the aiming needs some more love. It feels random where you land your shots, but already you have different predators and prey to hunt.There are NPC missions to complete, I only wish there was more variety and maybe NPCs roaming the map someday.As far as glitches go, I lost chickens in the beginning due to something not being able to recreate, but no animal deaths since then. Sometimes while leaving the car I fall down from the sky a few hundred meters away, once I fell through the map. All of those have never been game-breaking.TLDR: You can have tons of fun if you don't get your feathers ruffled by a few minor (yet) unpolished aspects;10 April, 2022;
Ranch Simulator: Farm, Build, Hunt;StarFusion617;NOT INFORMED;68 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 25.8 hrs on record;Overall, especially considering the game is still in early access, Ranch Sim is a great game. It allows the player to build freely on their property, including blueprints for things like walls and windows in case you'd prefer to design your own buildings. You also have free range of the world to hunt and cut down trees for extra wood. The layout of the buildings in relation to the ranch is a bit confusing at first but grows on you over time, and eventually those hairpin turns become quirks of the trip instead of annoying directional distractions. The actual ranching aspect of the game is also nice. You can buy chickens, pigs, cows, and goats to raise and either slaughter or use to get produce. At stores you can buy products to help you along, such as meat grinders and milk buckets. The graphics are very nice, even if you have a slower computer and need to put them down (like me). The first and third person view options are also useful for driving in reverse versus doing things on the ranch. Now to get into some of the specifics:Pros:- beautiful graphics, even on low settings- variety of animals to raise- multiple ways to play (ranching, hunting, farming, etc.)- free range on your ranch to build and design it how you like- free car at the beginning, negating any unnecessary walking before grinding for a car- good control mechanics, using mainly left click and E as interact buttons and WASD for movement (including driving)- variety of products to buy from the stores to make your job easier as you get enough money to buy them- gas is not ridiculously expensive like it often is in these types of gamesCons:- sometimes the controls in first person mode can be difficult because the character sways from side to side as you move the mouse, often causing you to misclick items- there are few directions on how to actually utilize the products from the stores and how to get your ranch going after the tutorial- driving controls are very sensitive and sometimes cause you to run into trees- metal is extremely expensive- you cannot rebuild the arch at the entrance to your ranch if you remove it for any reason- you cannot rebuild the garage if you remove it for any reason- bears sometimes appear in store areas- deer will literally change directions to make you run into them- animals eat a lot of food compared to how expensive it is to buy it- you cannot sell some items back to the storesTo go into a little more depth on the cons:When you go into the build menu, which is very nicely put together by the way, there is no explanation on any of the builds. While this might seem unnecessary for stuff like houses, things like preserving bins would be nice if they had a little more detail in the descriptions (for raw or salami or cooked meat, etc.). It would also be nice if you could change your view to be wider once you have a blueprint selected, since a lot of the time you can't see the area around what you're placing (important for things like connecting fences).Another serious problem I've found is the price of food. $30 a bag doesn't seem like much when you start with over a thousand dollars, but after you buy animals you'll quickly realize they eat a lot. Chickens' eggs sell for very little, and with hens only laying once a day, they're not a great method of making money. Pigs, being the next animal up in price, are much better. They can be bought and fed until they're big enough to be slaughtered for profit meat. The problem here comes with the feeding part. Two pigs (a male and a female) eat about one bag of food a day. If the female becomes pregnant and has 4ish babies, you're suddenly going through three bags a day. Add chickens into that (eggs increase the selling price of meat), and you're using up bags as quickly as you can buy them. Eventually you'll run out of money, be unable to buy more food, and lose half or more of your animals to starvation before they're ready to be slaughtered for profit. Either the price of food needs to be decreased, or animals need to eat less, because right now it's incredibly hard to get your ranch off the ground.Speaking of that, there's no directions as to what to do after you complete the tutorial. Nowhere in the game can you easily get information like how eggs increase meat profit, boiling sausages on a stove increases profit, there's a drying room in a ranch house, animals die immediately once their food bar runs out (which can be within a day), you can't sell back concrete or metal, etc. It would be nice if you could complete some sort of notebook within the game that has these things written down so that not everything is so hard to learn.The barn design is another thing that bothers me. The stall doors only open/close from the outside, so getting an animal to stay inside while you close the door is really hard. You cannot make the floor anything but grass, so eggs get lost and water piles up from the rain (even though you have a roof). The windows cannot be closed. Side doors only open in two separate pieces--you can't latch them together like in real barns and make it a single piece door, so opening and closing it can be a chore. The barn is peeling in paint and old-looking as soon as it's built, which would be fine except everything else the player builds looks brand new. It'd be nice if the barn reflected that too. Some animals are a little big for the barn stalls, so it'd be nice if you could expand the barn more than three times (which is already a small barn to begin with) and have bigger stalls.Notes for the developers:- make food less expensive or make animals eat less- make it possible to sell back things like concrete and metal- make it possible to sell unprocessed wood for quick cash- make the barn stall doors able to be closed/opened from the inside- make it possible to close the barn windows to prevent rain from coming inside- add a flashlight (it gets pitch-black at night and you only have mounted lights and your car's headlights)- make it take longer for animals to starve (like maybe more than a single day please?)- make eggs more profitable or make chickens produce more so that they're actually worth having around- add instructions on how the rest of the game works beyond the basic tutorial- make the barn have an actual floor (and maybe add buyable bags of shavings for the animals)- make the side barn doors able to be one piece instead of two- fix the field of view in first person mode so that holding items (like bags of wheat, for example) and viewing blueprints doesn't block the view of what's in front of you/where you're trying to place it- fix the weird swaying motion that makes it hard to click on things in first person mode- PLEASE make built items moveable! I should be able to pick up and move a small table, like come on- half of what you got from building something when you break it should be more like three quarters, especially if they're immovable once placed down- I've also experience a lot of having to click items three or four times before it registers (which isn't my mouse or computer because I've never had that problem before) so maybe see about looking into thatOverall, I would recommend this game, especially in early access, because I think it has a lot of potential and is fun to play right now. You can easily sink six straight hours into this game. But be warned that there are a lot of little frustrating things that can be improved (and hopefully will be) as the game progresses in development.Happy ranching!;6 December, 2022;
Ranch Simulator: Farm, Build, Hunt;haven't;NOT INFORMED;111 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 68.6 hrs on record;****IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME READ THIS POST FIRST PLEASE! ****I wanted to spend a decent amount of time playing this game before posting my review. I was looking for a game where I could cut down trees, hunt, build and farm. No people to kill or zombies (just dangerous animals)...there is shooting.....driving cars.....Jump Button...No fall damage...No eating....No Drinking....No harm from elements...From the looks of it, that was this game, and why I decided to purchase it and give it a try. I only read a few comments before purchasing, and I do not regret spending the money on this game by any means. In the beginning, it definitely does start out slow, so just go in with that mindset and expect to GRIND. It took me a little bit to figure out what I could sell at the stores, and where to put my goods when I want to sell them. Part of that was just because I was rushing and not really looking around. If you need any assistance with selling items or item prices - you can find info on trusty old Google. Also, I thought it was horrible at the beginning because I didn't realize there was a flashlight ( press 'L') :D Nights were horrible once it was pitch black for a little bit...but the sun does always rise :)BUILDING/CRAFTING ::The building system is pretty easy to get the hang of. I like that you can setup the blueprint first and then build using the wood. This way you can see the idea before wasting the time and using wood. When removing, you only remove the blueprint then. Comes in handy when you have to cut and then use the wood saw, over and over and over and over and over again. Items usually snap (somewhat) and then you can rotate them.....I will agree with the post I read....it is extremely annoying that I cannot make perfect square fences, so I decided to go for rounded fences....so far it's doing all right :) Besides not fully snapping, there could be more items to craft...HUNTING ::Hunting is pretty easy and bullets are low enough cost to be able to purchase quickly in the beginning. Selling meat is one of the quicker ways to make money. My biggest issue is that I can't find predators easily....are they hiding from me!?!? lolIt sucks when you get killed by a predator and haven't saved recently..... HINT:: buy a camping blow up bed from the hardware store and keep it in your car so you can save frequently without having to go back to the ranch. I think they should add fishing .)FARMING::;19 July, 2023;

FIA European Truck Racing Championship;ManuBAD;NOT INFORMED;88 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 27.5 hrs on record;You have a limited reserve of water for each race, and when your brakes become too hot after reducing your speed (represented by a circular meter surrounding the water gauge) you’ll need to spray them with water to reduce their temperature. Let them heat up too much and your brake pads will begin to deteriorate, which will reduce their performance and make taking bends and chicanes a nightmare. Inject too much and the pads will grow cold, making them too stiff to accurately gauge your stopping distance.If you’re new to racers in general, dont worry, you can toggle the brake cooling mechanics OFF.FIA European Truck Racing Championship is a surprisingly good racer, though it’s not going to appeal to all due to the fact that it’s about racing big heavy trucks rather than the latest sports cars. Still, for those seeking something a little bit different, it’s definitely worth investigating. I wouldn’t say it does anything spectacularly well, but when there’s nothing else quite like it available, it doesn’t matter all that much. The official FIA ETRC game is a completely new option for all fans of racing sims.? 45 trucks with their official livery, including top manufacturers like Volvo, Man, Freightliner and Western Star? 20 teams and the championship's best drivers? 14 circuits including official ETRC ones, as well as Laguna Seca, Circuit of The Americas and Fuji Speedway? 5 single-player modes and 3 multiplayer modes#cioflix | iPLAY4FUN | myArtwork;26 April, 2020;

FIA European Truck Racing Championship;of;NOT INFORMED;70 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 21.8 hrs on record;Well, this is something truly different and in my opinion well worth picking up. With the usual slow summer for game releases, the FIA Truck Racing game intrigued me. The game launched today and after a quick single lap tutorial that covers the basics of truck control, I was quickly into a race.https://youtu.be/bMr_j75364cFirst impressions, the good stuff:+++ Size and weight. Immediately and in real contrast to the usual car racing games the size and weight of these trucks is transmitted superbly, they feel big, slow to react and momentum is key. This is much better than the Mercedes Truck in Forza 7 which feels like an on stilts version of the Forza cars. Even the Automobilista trucks rev and drive like cars in comparison to the way the FIA Truck Racing trucks feel. These trucks handle differently to anything I've tried before.+++ Water-cooled brakes, managing the brake temperatures with water cooling is a real challenge. If the brakes get too hot the trucks spin easily. Having only a limited amount of water for the race adds to the strategy. I've never seen this before in a game and it is enjoyable.;18 July, 2019;

Anyone that is a fan of racing, or a fan of trucks, or both, this is a very enjoyable racing sim. Yes I called it a sim, because the physics are pretty damn good and the sounds and truck details are amazing.First thing I did when I launched the game was go into video settings get everything maxed out (the game looks good), then into controls to make sure everything was mapped. It automatically mapped the G27 correctly from what I could tell, but I still went through the buttons to make sure and have my own preferences. Paired with adjusting some of the feedback settings in game, and manual shifting and clutch, it feels good and is really fun. I can see myself coming back and doing the career races and things for fun, when I'm feeling like hooning some big rigs around a track. They can drift quite nicely too. :)Took some getting used to, a completely different driving style to say, a GTLM car or something,;13 February, 2021;
FIA European Truck Racing Championship;Homicidal_Milk;NOT INFORMED;7 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Not Recommended 1.4 hrs on record;The game visually looks good. The tracks look beautiful, the trucks have good models and it all seems fine in the screenshots, but there are some major flaws. The tutorial is way too long. You can't skip dialog and it feels like they're holding your hand through the first hour over every little thing. Also the licence tests are not fun. In Gran Turismo they are fun little challenges that gives you rewards but in this game you have to do all 15 of the most boring tests imaginable. They aren't even challenging since one of them I beat with 5 seconds to spare, and the challenge was to take a single corner.Once you start racing the game it gets even worse with the easiest ai ever. I was barely even trying in my very first race and I won by over 10 seconds. It doesn't better with harder difficulty because they feel the exact same. Also the ai drivers keep spinning and crashing for no reason. On one track the trucks just kept braking in the middle of the straight for no reason. Later in that race a truck was just parked in the middle of the track.It's a real shame. I wanted to like this game but it feels like they didn't even play test this game. They aren't going to fix any of this since the last update was a year ago so sadly, I do not recommend this game.;1 November, 2020;
FIA European Truck Racing Championship;V.I.C.;NOT INFORMED;8 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 7.3 hrs on record;As a big fan of Formula Truck by Reiza Studios, this FIA ETRC inmediately caught my attention. Comparing the two games is not fair, since the former is an pro simulator with accurate truck physics, but that doesn't mean the latter can't deliver. Indeed, the game offers many exciting moments, but there are also plenty of small inconvenients that need patching to elevate it to its full potential.The good:-Trucks are fun to drive, they feel hefty and are prone to oversteer if you floor it. It's NOT sim handling, but offers a fair balance of accesibility that anyone can enjoy.-Decent amount of tracks and trucks. -Graphics are nice, although not impressive.-ETRC GP rules are accurate.-Good sound, although a bit lackbusterThe bad:-AI has many issues. They're pretty slow and rubberband-y, even at the expert difficulty. They also have the tendency to brake randomly at certain full-speed segments. You can easily go from back to front of pack in a few laps. This makes full-length events a boring experience, since you can lead 80% of the race without anything interesting going on.-Graphics are not fully optimized. Some tracks induce some serious framerate drops that go as low as 40 FPS. The recommended card in the official system specs list the GTX 960, so in theory it should run silky smooth in any modern system. It seems the issue is related to the environments, since any other zone where the background isn't visible makes the framerate return to normal. Hope there's a fix.-Needs more opponents on track. A real ETRC GP has 18 trucks on average, while the game only allows 12 maximum.- The pit crew girl repeats the warnings about overheating brakes EVERY CORNER. Her ocasional comments are nice but she gets extremely repetitive after a while.In a nutshell: Truck racing games are rare, so this is a breath of fresh air in motorsport gaming. Unfortunately, it currently offers less than the sum of its parts and its in urgent need of patch fixes. If you can get it at $20 (which I did), and you don't mind waiting for improvements, it's a good (if average) title for the motorsport gaming enthusiast.;20 July, 2019;

Its rare reporting a bug actually results in said bug being fixed, These games haven't typically been given many updates, Usually just a few shortly after release and then we'll hear nothing from the devs until a dlc comes out or the next game. Saving the game should become a habit, as there are glitches that'll force you to have to close down and restart your game, So its always good to have saved your progress so you can go back to just before you experienced the issue. The pricing of this game (I've always stood by this) makes no sense, This game is a recycled copy of the last edition managed by devs who dont care for us much. Its design is pretty old and its buggy for 'almost' everyone who has it, even brand new releases like the 2022 edition. There are games that cost more than triple what this one did being sold for around the same price and cheaper, Altogether with dlc you're looking at £60+ I don't see how this game is worth that much or how eversim justify those figures given the fact the product sold is faulty from birthNot sure I like the idea of each yearly update being sold as a brand new game, Feels like it should be an update because not a single game in the series has been finished, Not really they're all riddled with bugs (Still)This game isn't ultra realistic, Its realistic in certain areas and aspects but ultrarealistic seems like an exaggeration and I feel like the bugs are partly to blame for that.This game has so much potential to be so much but eversim just do not care about you, this game, this series or their reputation, They just want your money so they'll do this each year and ignore you all until they finally realise that this'll only work for so long, Someone better than them will eventually make a game just like this just not as garbage and poof eversims history. Even if that doesn't happen, Sales aren't rising for eversim and its unlikely they're going to, Eventually we'll all realise that you'll never improve and 1 by 1 people will just stop paying for the new copies you release and again, poof just like that eversim becomes a forgotten memory. Radical change internally is needed, Or eversim need to sell this game to a developer who has more than 1 hour to whip up a game that looks like it was coded in the early 2000s because frankly for the price each and every one of us has paid this is not good enough. Oh and did I mention the devs made a unique system for this game? So If you get a new hard drive, or switch pcs sometimes the game will lock you out with an error code and the only way to resolve it, Is to contact eversim and wait ages for them to get back to you so they can unlock your game. (True story)Pros:This game is by far one of the best geosims out there and the idea behind it is quite unique. Personally despite all of its flaws I find myself buying each and every version, Ever since 2018 edition got released. This is one of the only games where you can govern multiple nations, Go to war, Manage the international community, Commit to trade and create, remove and change laws in so many different sectors while being able to observe local and global statistics that coincide with the things you do as ruler of your nations. You can do all this, The bugs dont prevent the game from operating entirely but you do need to get used to the bugs, learn to live with them and adjust your gameplay to it. You'll also need to overlook a few broken stats and systems but overall you CAN get decent hours of gameplay from this game.So far I have 11, Only 2 hours of that has actually been properly playing the game. The gamble on whether to buy this game or not falls down to you ultimately and your tolerance to buggy games.;10 May, 2022;
Power & Revolution 2022 Edition;Kitty;NOT INFORMED;61 people found this review helpful10 people found this review funny; Recommended 297.0 hrs on record;After 14 years of playing every iteration of this game, it is finally almost ready to leave beta quality stage. I am actually enjoying longer game sessions instead of playing for a couple of hours then saying yep, we're not there yet! Let's say between 2008-2021, all iterations of GPS/power&revolution/rulerOfNations etc... left me feeling like my pocket got picked.They've caught some of the most annoying bugs and many of the weird interface quirks. Just enough to make the game entertaining. The best way to enjoy this is to take a small country and try to make it a superpower. The game will still go completely nuts if there are too many wars (wars will randomly start and end and restart), or too much internal turmoil then you keep getting the annoying (it's time to choose message). So the rule is don't change the laws too fast. Don't be involved in more than 1 war. Industrial espionage is a great way to go. I just hate how if you do political espionage and get ministers as moles, every day you have to answer a question about whether you want the minister to kill the president of their country. What idiot at Eversim came up with this? political espionage isn't about assassinations. I should only be getting secrets like they're helping terrorists or starting a nuclear program or cheating on their wife, assassinations should work the other way around, I should be the one contacting the secret police to ask the mole if they would do it. As it is if you have 15 moles in 15 countries, every single day you have to answer a question about whether they should kill their president! It slows the whole game down. Many of these yes/no questions don't have the remember my decision checkbox, and Even the ones that do, don't actually remember the decision, it still keeps coming up with the dialog with the question but removes the options, so it's kinda pointless. Then there is the construction tabs where for some purchases you get an empty picklist for where you want to do the purchase, and when you click on it, it only has the country name, so why are you making me click on it? if a picklist has 1 option it should be pre-selected. Interface design 101!!! Oh and another one in the same screen is that for some buildings, they don't have the distribute in all region option, and if you want to build the building in all regions, you have to build each one separately which gets exhausting if you have a healthy budget and you want to do all of them. The other really annoying one is when you are trying to get the general to approve chemical weapons. (my soldierly honor bla bla bla). Soldiers have no honor in an ultimate dictatorship, I should not be getting that response if I am king, parliament has no power, there is a 1 party system, justice is completely in state control, schools are indoctrinated, all media is public, internet is censored, strikes are outlawed, unions are all banned, and this 1 general is the only one who gets to say no to me about anything? Where is the (off with his head) option?Oh scratch that, if you try to ban all religions, when you go to ban the last one, the minister of homeland security refuses to do it! Off with his head :)The other one that gets annoying although it's kinda realistic so more forgivable, is when you annex a country, it will automatically change your star allocations for the different budget. so if I had 10 stars for the president's security budget, and I annex Lithuania then suddenly find the 10 stars changed to 6 and I have to pass another law to set it back. I feel it should change the numeric amount to increase it on annexation rather than reduce the stars or at least right when you decide to annex, ask you if you want to keep all budget allocations the same and explain that this would increase the cost by X amount and the budget will be a deficit or surplus by Y percent.Also, in a dictatorship, if I dissolve parliament, when parliament has no real power, it should remain dissolved and not have any further impact. Rather the game forces a new parliament to be elected automatically. Even if Parliament has no real power, I declare war on 1 country and next thing I find parliament had an extraordinary session to depose me. The same parliament that is dissolved and has no power!Bottom line, it is much better than it used to be, maybe by 2030 it will be release quality :D;28 July, 2022;

There are about 15-25+ *new* bugs within this edition compared to 2021. The factor contributing to this immense amount of bugs is a rushed game. We can tell you rushed this edition, because it came out earlier than on average. I understand that you're a very small team, but a good developer would take the time to analyze code, fix bugs and errors, and configure game settings. A possible reason on why they released it early:Their last edition stop making enough sales to produce income for the developers, so in order to feed the developers wallets, they had to release the new version before they risked bankruptcy.

Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor;Darkwing;NOT INFORMED;88 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 31.3 hrs on record;It's a shame that this game isn't better. It is SO CLOSE to being a classic that I would put hundreds or thousands of hours into. Unfortunately, the solid core gameplay is betrayed by the boring and repetitive quests, the small scale of the world design, and the lack of any difficult longterm goals. It's doubly damning considering the core gameplay was more or less lifted straight from Captain Forever, but then put into a smaller world, taking away the joy of discovery and exploration that was a key part of Captain Forever. This should have been an open world game. Period. Planets should have been just one environment in a vast universe awaiting you if you fire your thrusters long enough. Instead, they tried to put Captain Forever into a really weak, watered down version of FTL, and the game really suffers for it.If you're really into building, the sandbox mode may make this game worth it for you, but don't expect to play the main game for very long.;30 April, 2021;

I wanted to like this game, but as a programmer I'm disappointed. My expectations for a ""space drone constructor"" are to be able to leverage clever program logic and engineering to prevail. Except... you can't. Competitive designs in this game revolve primarily around exploiting the glitches in Unity's wonky physics with a minimal amount of logic for navigation. To break down why this is so:- Drone components can only be attached to one other component. This makes it difficult to create stable structures intuitively since the stresses are always placed on the parent element, rather than distributed through multiple supports. This is incredibly frustrating from an engineering standpoint, as it is near impossible to build trusses.- The Unity physics engine isn't deterministic. While an element of randomness in play is fine, in a bleeding edge design this often results in advanced designs either exploding or performing amazingly, depending on your luck. There's even variance in different modes. sometimes a design that works fine in Test will explode in Tournament, and vice-versa.- Structural components aren't necessary in designs. Competitive tournament designs often consist of just engine and fuel pods lashed together in whichever configuration keeps them from sheering apart... most of the time.- Logic parts are mostly rudimentary gate logic, count against your ship's mass/part total, are vulnerable to being destroyed, and have a propagation delay that is too long to be relevant in competition designs. I'd love to see a simple scripting language implementation that you often see in games like this, but it's not here.Other issues: - The editor doesn't have an option to ""Exit without Saving"". Fixed in 1.1.1.- Survival Mode's threat levels punish experimentation with drones by increasing the ""threat"" level every time you deploy and charging you resources. This discourages tweaking designs, outside of Programmer mode, as you're penalized for pulling out of a mission early. This mode also penalizes you by charging you more resources for larger drones, discouraging more complicated, more fun designs.The game isn't terrible, as it's entertaining to test racing drone designs while working in another window, but I'd vastly prefer a game that encouraged learning engineering concepts and programming techniques than exploiting glitches. If the game's more glaring exploits were resolved, and survival mode re-balanced to be more friendly, the game would be good.That said, I uploaded a number of overpowered, glitch exploiting designs to the competitive pool to help encourage the problems to be fixed. :)";16 May, 2020;

Kind of like a DM that doesn't let his/her players push the boundaries with creativity.Ultimately, the part selection combined with the much-to-be-desired physics engine fall flat.

Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor;Shamus_Aran;NOT INFORMED;51 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 20.0 hrs on record;"You can listen to/watch my review here.I've got a lot of mixed feelings about this game in its current state. A lot of it good, a lot of it bad.Good:The ability to program automated functions with sensors and logic gates is a thing of beauty. I've never felt happier than the time I built a hovering platform that mass-produced fighter craft that followed my cursor and stopped to fire, or the time I figured out how to program a turret to scan and lock onto enemies with a handful of operations.The construction system is robust, and it's very easy to create a drone that fits what you want to do with minimal fuss. Even then, you'll spend a ton of time tweaking and perfecting a design, seeing what you can get away with and discovering new possibilities through experimentation and inspiration from the Workshop.I can see the ""sumo"" mode or other game modes that take away direct control getting a lot of mileage, even if I'm terrible at building them.Weapon variety is excellent from the jump, though any weapon besides rockets needs some research to get up to par.Bad:The camera is zoomed way too far in, especially for the minimum size of drone the developers seem to want you to make. To have a jack-of-all-trades drone that can at least attempt any mission type, you'll need a battery, a fuel tank, three resource tanks, a resource harvester, a weapon, thrusters for going forward and backward, thrusters for turning, and a magnet. Most of those parts are static 2x2 boxes, which means your drone will be eating up a lot of real estate on the screen. Add to that the fact that enemies can aggro and attack you from off screen, and certain missions become a matter of memorizing which enemies are where and blindly firing in their general direction.There are only three mission types I've encountered so far. One where you have to track down and destroy an enemy transmitter, one where you have to destroy eggs around the planet while avoiding a giant snake, and one where you have to use a magnet to pick up and transport barrels to your resource deposit station. The barrel missions are the worst by far, as enemies can blow the barrels up with only a shot or two, and often do since the barrels usually spawn right on top of them. I can't understand why metal barrels are so fragile, yet do so much damage when destroyed. If you're carrying a barrel and it takes a stray shot from an enemy turret, it can absolutely total your ship. Add to that the fact that enemies have a bit too much health and the best weapon (the rocket launcher) is hilariously inaccurate, and barrel missions end up taking way too long to complete. At one point I couldn't get to 2/3rds of the star chart because every single route was gated behind a barrel mission I had given up on and was trying to find a way around.The tech tree is an interesting idea hampered by some questionable design choices. Most of the upgrades require blue minerals to research, which I haven't seen any of in the 9 hours I've been playing. This means you're limited to boring stuff like damage upgrades, energy cost reduction, and digging power.Lingering questions:Why are there so few mission types?Why does every planet have to have a mission? Why can't I just go onto a planet for the sole purpose of mining resources?Why are barrels, resource crates, and mineable resource terrain destructible?Why do we only have a single shield part, and why is the shield it creates so fragile for its energy cost?The 3d printer part is amazing, but is it wise to give it, of all things, no energy cost?Why is air resistance so heavy on every single planet?Why does rubbing against a tiny outcropping of rock all but immobilize my drone?Why are downgrades in the tech tree at all? And why do I have to research them to unlock certain branches of the tree?What's the point of plasma and cryo weapons when killing an enemy is easier and faster with kinetic weapons? If there are special interactions I don't know about, can they be signposted better?Why would I ever use bio weapons?Suggestions:Let us zoom out the camera.Either take the blue resource cost out of some of the tech tree, or spawn it on earlier planets.Add more mission types -- hell, give us a mining expedition a la Deep Rock Galactic where the whole point is gathering things.Seriously, zoom out the camera. I can't see a damn thing.In conclusion, Nimbatus feels like a bare bones game tacked onto an excellent base of logic-based drone construction. If you like the idea of pushing a construction system to see what's possible within it, I'd say give it a shot. If you want to spend more time outside of the drone editor than in it, maybe wait on it.";7 October, 2018;

Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor;Gadgetguy;5,619 products in account;87 people found this review helpful11 people found this review funny; Recommended 15.3 hrs on record;Weapon parts are the most customizable of any parts.Weapon LabThe weapon lab is a feature found in the built in editor. Once selected, the player can create presets. Lasers and bullets can be created with one of four damage types: kinetic, heat, cold, and bio. Kinetic is the most basic type and doesn’t do anything special. Heat will warm up objects and enemies hit by the weapon and will cause them to overheat. Cold will also cease functions of enemies if an enemy doesn’t have a defense against it. Bio is the best damage type to mine planets. Once the player has created a preset, resources collected can be spent on improving the weapon. Increased damage, less energy consumption, and increased attack speed are just a few of the upgrades that can be used. Better weapons are important too, because the main mission type in the game has the player destroying enemies. Part placement is also important.Part ConnectionParts can’t all be connected to the drone core as it will cause the player’s drone to become unbalanced and difficult to control. Instead, parts must be connected to one another so that balance is maintained and the connection limit isn’t hit. This can be a tricky undertaking that is almost puzzle like in nature as a player tries to maintain the perfect balance. This is also one of the places that could use some quality of life tweaking the most. If parts are connected to a single part and I want to replace that single part, then I have to delete the entire section. This can become frustrating as large chains appear with complex drones. MissionsMission appear in two main varieties: Destruction and Sumo. Destruction missions require the player to build a drone that can survive enemies’ attacks and that can destroy these attacking enemies. It is also helpful if the player includes some resource collection utility on their drone as every planet has resources that can be used in the weapon lab. It is quite fun to build drones for these mission types as they require drones with two vastly different requirements. Sumo mission have the player creating a drone that the player can’t pilot. The drone must be made completely autonomous with sensor input. The drone must then push their opponent outside of an ever shrinking ring. ? Overall:?If someone enjoys building crazy vehicles with lots of customization options, then this is the game for them. It has one of the deepest editors for this kind of game, and since the game is in early access it can only get better from here.?? Story: ??There isn’t much story in the game. The plot summary appears to be that the player is a drone operator who does odd jobs from the safety of their private space ship. ?? Sound:??The sound design is average. The music is mainly made up synthesizer beats with a slow tempo. These do add a bit to the overall atmosphere, but I didn’t feel like any moment were made better thanks to the influence of the music. The sound effects for the weapons and thrusters are well recorded.?? Graphics: ?? The graphics in the game have a sleek artstyle that delves a bit into the abstract. The game does use a muted color palette which can make it displeasing to look at sometimes. The game becomes fully vibrant once the player begins shooting weaponry. Weapon colors contrast heavily with the backgrounds and drones. Where a planet might be a deep purple or a forest green, lasers are unapologetically neon red. A laser light show occurs that may only be rivaled by tittles like “Beat Hazard”. This makes every battle a spectacle to behold as weaponry from the player and their enemies help to brighten up the bleakness of space.

LOST PLANET® 3;Critical;NOT INFORMED;178 people found this review helpful; Recommended 48.0 hrs on record;Okay, so here is the deal. Yes, the gameplay is altered substantially from the previous two, yes the T-Energy mechanic doesn't come into play sadly. I had hoped the game might have had a section as a nod to the old games where Jim's suit gets damaged but alas it did not.Co-operative play is also not featured anywhere in the single player story.This said however, while the gameplay is somewhere inbetween extreme condition and the first dead space title, the controls most of the time feel fairly fluid.The characters, especially Jim Peyton himself are really likable and it kept me immersed in the story. Jim's wife is a very interesting character (as well as Jim himself)and the game has a lot of soul.Jim isn't a grizzled space marine who can kill an akrid from 300 metres, but he is also not out of his depth.With a temperament somewhere between a trucker and a cowboy he instantly became (for me) one of my favourite videogame protagonists of all timeWhen you're out there on your own, with just music you brought from planet earth (the game imports music from your computer files so you can creat your own soundtrack for the cold wastelands) you really feel like there's no-one else you can count on but yourself. You feel isolated and in danger at every second.This also works in reverse, that when you get a message from your in game wife you feel like you're at home, like you're making a difference and the characters really come to life. The same can be said when you return to coronis and upgrade your rig and weapons, greeting old friends.There's a fair bit of longevity in the upgrades to your rig. Certain upgrades allow you to get to new places you couldn't before, or allow you to scrounge for scrap metal in new places.The controls when fighting the akrid will feel a little alien at first due to the over the shoulder viewpoint of the camera, but you quickly get used to the contextual-only use of the grappling hook as well as dodging out of the way of enemies.Fans of the series will be pleased to know that this does actually provide an interesting and very unexplained part of the story of the franchise and while they do retcon one or two things, it really does feel like it's for the better. The plot makes sense and while isn't anything spectacular, it is coherent and well-written. The supporting cast for me, was what really pulled along the plot for me and kept me interested even while trying to hunt down those annoying albino akrid.The setpieces out in the ice and snow are quite fantastic and this is where the game excels, in the sheer scale of the areas outside. The opposite is unfortunately true in that on the occasional offchances you go into an enclosed space, combat and movement can feel clunky and out of place.It's a shame likely the repetitive sidequests will put anyone off buying this because the atmosphere is amazing.You really do feel like a lone contractor out in the middle of nowhere drilling for a precious substance. I imagine the feeling and atmosphere in this game is not all that disimilar from the feelings of isolation and longing that ice truckers deal with on a day to day bonus.Which brings us to the Rigs. The rig is not the vital suit (this is a prequel don't forget), it is an entirely different breed of machine, but this isn't a bad thing.Yes, there are a few mechs in this game and while at first you may lament the loss of having shoulder mounted rockets and gatling guns, you will immediately warm up to the defensive and offensive capabilities of Jim's machine. Admittedly the rig can feel quite slow at times and while this may have been an artistic choice by the devs at Spark it can bog down the pace at times until you access fast travel quite early in the game. The good news is that those who loved the sheer mayhem and carnage of slicing off a limb or two from the large akrid will be right at home. It is just as satisying, maybe moreso to time your grab just right as you hold the creature and helplessly drill into it's cores with the drill arm as their lifeblood (T-energy) spills out.I should point out that I was only ever interested in the game (and series) for the single player experience and therefore I did not touch multiplayer. My understanding is some of the maps from extreme condition make a reappearance and generally most reviewers say the online is where the strength of the game really lies.This game did poorly due to the mountain of scathing critiques and generally poor write-ups it received.I personally enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the series for the story.In terms of all the bad press and poor scores, I'd advise you to try it for yourself, it's not the most amazing game in terms of graphics or presentation but I sure had fun with it.;6 August, 2014;

WORK.-The strategy for killing the akrids (including the bosses) is always the exact same (dodge as they charge, shoot when they're stunned)-Fighting in the rig is beyond pointless (it's ALWAYS better to get out and fight in-person)-The boss fights are ridiculously stupid (the one in the rig is mind-bendingly atrocious)-Bosses are recycled all over the place (you kill the giant crab thing in 3 different boss fights alone)-The game straight-up lies about button prompts (""W/A/S/D to turn wheel"" really means ""tap f repeatedly"")-The audio logs are filled with SO MANY juicy, lip-smacky, mouth-poppy sounds that it sounds like the mic is being eaten-The base only has a few people you can actually interact with, so it feels lifeless-It is completely arbitrary where/when you can grapple/repel-There is no visual indicator of health (other than when you're near-death), and your ammo count vanishes and reappears whenever it feels like it (EDIT: I've been informed that your ammo count and the rest of your HUD disappear when you get too far from the mech)-And so many other little tiny annoyancesIf you're a more patient person than I am, you could probably put up with this game, and might even enjoy it. I, however, found it joyless, tedious, and boring. It is a paint-by-numbers, designed-by-committee, heartless blob of checklists, man-hours, and coding. Life is too short to slog through uninteresting crap, and this game didn't make the cut (for me). You may enjoy it, but please don't spend more than $5 on it.";15 March, 2015;
LOST PLANET® 3;AbedsBrother;1,472 products in account;50 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 52.8 hrs on record;Lost Planet 3 has a good story, decent action, and some great graphics (for its time). Unfortunately, it takes about fours hours of gameplay before things get interesting, which I think is why there are so many reviews stating the game is boring and slow. This delayed arrival of the “good stuff” means you won't be able to really judge the merits of the game without going past Steam's 2-hour refund limit. If being stuck on an ice-planet with a giant mech and aliens sounds like fun, go ahead and grab Lost Planet 3 when it's on sale.Total installation size on my hard-drive (with all DLC and HD cutscenes pack): 27 GB.Notes:- Multiplayer is dead. Don't plan on getting 100% of the game's achievements unless you can get some people together to help you out.- There is a technical issue with the mechanical claw of the Rig. Left mouse-button attaches it to an object. if that object needs to be rotated, the screen prompt is “tap WASD to turn the claw.” THIS IS WRONG. The correct way to turn the claw is to repeatedly tap the F key. This is a common enough issue that a quick forum search revealed the answer, but how the heck does that slip by the QA testing?- A more minor problem: there is no message if you do not yet have the attachment your rig needs for a specific action. I thought the game was broken at one point, but as it turns out the winch needed an upgrade to throw the grapple further and hit what I wanted it to. the game never flashed a message like, “rig upgrade required for this action.” Just be sure you've got the upgrades you need.;10 June, 2016;

LOST PLANET® 3;curator;page for more reviews!;32 people found this review helpful; Recommended 46.5 hrs on record;"Average ending to an average trilogy.Lost Planet 3 is a third-person shooter action-adventure video game developed by Spark Unlimited and published by Capcom.StoryLost Planet 3 is a prequel to previous two titles. Thanks to that weird decision, you don't have to play previous titles to understand the story.Game tells a story of Jim Peyton, who joins the expedition funded by NEVEC to mine the resources of E.D.N. III, allowing him to support his family on Earth. As he gets used to harsh planet conditions and wildlife, he discovers multiple secrets lying deep in the planet.GameplayLost Planet 3 brings back cold and ice covered E.D.N. III known from first title, with changes to the gameplay.Now Lost Planet 3 is a semi-open world title, featuring locations unlocking as you progress in the storyline, and hub location where you can improve your equipment, unlike previous two more linear titles with open level design.Your goal is to complete missions spread across the planet to progress further in the storyline. Game offers already mentioned main missions, and side tasks that help colonists of the planet.Just like previously game features on-foot plus vehicle exploration and combat.This time instead of multiple different machines, protagonist has his own Rig which is used throughout the game to travel, fight and progress. You can also upgrade it, and add new elements which will grant you access to new locations and areas.When you are close to Rig you have radar, but as you move out it slowly dissappers, and a locker where you can change your weapons loadout or refill ammo.During the combat against Akrid you have to get close and personal as this machine doesn't offer any ranged weapons. Majority of the combat is done by moving your arms around and QTEs.If you will recive a lot of damage, your machine with shut off for a moment and throw you away until it gets up back and running again.On-foot combat doesn't have any major changes. Jim can equip 2 different weapons plus grenades, and have a pistol as his sidearm. Akrids still have glowing red points which serve as a weakness you have to abuse, unless you want to waste a ton of ammo for one enemy.Akrids just like before come in different shapes and sizes, with occasional bigger monsters serving as a boss fight.Game added an option to take cover behind enviroment elements and to dodge attacks by jumping.This time Lost Planet features regenerative health system, after receiving damage you can find a safe spot or take cover and wait a moment to be fully healthy again.Completing missions and killing enemies grants you T-Energy which in this game serves as a currency! You can spend it on weapons and their upgrades, different types of more effective ammunition, or buy junk which serves as an material used to upgrade your rig. Junk can also be found throughout the world. Removal of T-Energy as a necessary survival material grants you more freedom in exploration.Besides T-ENG, you can collect audio and text long scattered around the world, which will expand the lore of events that took place in and before the game.Playtime, replayability and other modesStory takes up to 10 hours to complete, with additional 5 if you are interested in side-quests.Not much to replay here, it's a one-shot title.Besides Story, game features Multiplayer component where Snow Pirates and Nevec fight against each other, offering 3 game modes with different maps, scenarios and enemies.Unfortunately mode is inactive. In my ~50 hours of gameplay I have not found a single public Multiplayer game, only occasional one player just roaming around in a lobby.Pros and consThere is no denying that Lost Planet 3 features best story and characters out of trilogy. But that doesn't mean it's something superb either. It's enough to keep you interested to the end, and to remember characters after you are done with the game.New elements such as upgrade or cover mechanics are a nice addition, and collectibles adding interesting information about the world are appreciated.For balance the vehicle combat is much worse. Barely existing, focusing mainly on Quick-Time Events, not satisfying at all. Lack of it also makes entire gameplay a bit more repetitive, as now more than ever is is focused on fighting Akrid on foot, with rig being used as a transport.Level design is also something that could have been better, as most of the locations is just different landscape covered in ice and snow.Final words and conclusionIf you are going to get the game, don't bother with Complete Edition as it offers mainly additional content for Multiplayer, such as new maps and characters. A waste of money due to Multiplayer being inactive.If I could I would give it a mixed rating as game, like previous two titles, is ""okay"" at best. Lost Planet 3 offers better, more story-driven experience for weaker mech combat and repetitive gameplay. Check out";16 June, 2021;

LOST PLANET® 3;Alexavier;NOT INFORMED;23 people found this review helpful; Recommended 10.8 hrs on record;While I am quite aware that this review will more than likely not be read, I desire to share my own personal opinions upon this game.I'll happily admit that I have a bias towards liking this game as it's one of the first of its kind I ever played whilst growing up, one that I played on my Xbox 360 right alongside the typical classics of the time.With that statement out of the way, I think some things need to be stated. This game was not made as a PC game, it was made as a console game, then fitted with PC controls so naturally it may have its moments that don't make sense from a player experience perspective. Lost Planet 3 is certainly aged, and frankly it's aged not too terribly. Most of the negative reviews are from fans of LP 1 and 2 talking about how it doesn't line up with the older titles and frankly I can't say that they're wrong, however, as a game itself I personally find LP 3 to be an enjoyable experience. Boasting a story that ultimately is engaging enough to keep you interested and with fairly diverse areas to explore considering the setting itself. From caves to lava fields to everything in between, It's just hard for me to fault the game when it ultimately never did anything truly wrong except for dare to stand out in comparison to the games that came before.All in all, I personally recommend this game if you want to check out an interesting piece of gaming history that truly slipped under the radar. While it can be slow at times, and the graphics definitely aren't up to date - the game itself is an enjoyable experience. The only warning I can think to give is that if you don't like cover shooters, then you may dislike some of the on-foot sections which make heavy use of cover mechanics.;20 October, 2023;

Looking back at it now, this game might be why, but not only for bad reasons.

ELDEN RING;??M??NTIH;NOT INFORMED;2,713 people found this review helpful55 people found this review funny; Recommended 130.9 hrs on record;I'm a total noob when it comes to Souls-Games. Usually I play RPGs on easy mode to enjoy the story in peace.Obviously there is no proper easy mode in Elden Ring, but the game allows you to play it in your own pace.I literally spent the first 12-14 hours just riding around on my horse which I named Dolly, picked up flowers & only killed some easy enemies. The more I played the more I got confident & noticed that I'm able to kill some small dungeon bosses, because the game allows you to level up without going for the big bosses. When I felt strong enough I went for my first story boss & it was fun, not too easy, not too difficult. Like that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game. You can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world from the get go & just enjoy the view & smaller bosses.The game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere ingame. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on end until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now & do hundreds of other things instead.I would also like to mention that the open world is done really good! You're able to explore every single corner & the game even rewards you for being curious. There are no useless areas in which you waste your time. You're always getting some kind of reward everywhere you go.;13 April, 2022;

In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.Now, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.Imo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).Performance - I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt.

I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.In conclusion - The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).;23 June, 2023;

Soulmask;Bleddy;NOT INFORMED;367 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 26.2 hrs on record;"IMPORTANT FOREWORD: With respect, I genuinely don't understand how people who complain about the game's difficulty are able to write reviews saying as much, because there is absolutely no way that those people can read. Not only does the game prompt you to customize your difficulty when starting out, but it asks you if you want to change how hard it is EVERY TIME YOU LOAD INTO IT. Don't like decay? Okay... then don't play with it. Do you like decay but worried it might turn into a ""second job""? Then tell your AI tribe members to take care of it. Game is great so far, and it almost feels suspiciously cheap for the amount of content that is already in the game. Making your own custom mask, covering yourself in tattoos, and running through the bush to hunt down a target feels pretty good. I don't write many reviews but I'll try to list the general pros and cons. So far I have played on standard difficulty without changing anything, on a private session. TLDR: game almost too good for the price point, especially with release discount.PROS:- Gaining XP to progress is not tied to any one thing specifically, so you aren't ham-fisted into doing any one thing in particular for general progression. Want to be a civilization builder that has an expansive farmland and automated workers to facilitate that? Cool, every single action you take levels you up the same way as running around and constantly killing things.- Combat in the game starts out slow and simple, but it ramps up with the different build customizations. There are I think 8 weapons in current early access, and each has their own quirks and skills. The animations can be a bit stiff and jank sometimes, but visceral. Try countering with the one-handed blade and doing a punisher, it feels wonderful.- As a second but separate point to the combat, it feels like you are fighting for your life against just the AI tribe members, but in the best way possible. The AI post guards around their camps, and if one of them hears something they will investigate and alert others to the noise. When they find you, they have access to the same skills and weapons the player does (minus any mask related abilities). I had a fight outside of an AI tribal village with two guys pinning me down with arrow fire behind a rock, and a third flanking the rock with dual swords to push me in the open. I don't know if any of that is intended in the game, but when I finally won the fight I felt like a god.- There is quite a bit of customization this early in the EA phase. You can add ornaments and feathers to your mask, get new hairstyles and paint for your body, add modifiers and buffs to your armor and weapon sets, etc. The skill trees are expansive enough that you can set yourself apart from players easily, and your weapon/equipment loadouts appear on your character themselves.- The building is not as in-depth as Valheim (no structural integrity), but it has some similarities. There are a lot of little decorations and items to help make your little tribal hut look cool, and after a long expedition to investigate some ruins it feels pretty good to go home to your little tribe members running around and maintaining your base.- Once you figure out the AI work system for your tribe, it's nice to watch them run around and do a lot of the annoying collecting for you. You can set work zones for tribe members, and what each tribe member can do in those zones. Need a lot of wood for your bonfire so it doesn't decay? Tell your tribe member to go get it, they will collect it while you are offline and keep the fire going.CONS:- The animations are a bit jank and stiff. Sometimes it looks like the characters teleport between certain stances and actions. If these were smoothed out it would do wonders for immersion.- There are a LOT of recipes in the game. Your AI tribe members can do most (if not all) of them for you, but it may be a bit confusing at first to even figure out where to begin a recipe chain. The lack of an early mount system when you need clay or any other location specific resource means a long walk in multiple directions for either you or the AI tribe.- No crashes so far, but some minor bugs may be annoying. Want to loot the chest when there aren't any enemies around, but you get a warning saying there are enemies? One of the enemies might have spawned under the map, so you have to poke them with a stick through the floor until they die. Want to move a workbench that has an AI tribe member assigned to it? They may get confused and stand in a corner where the bench was, so you have to toggle their job assignments for them to regain sentience.CON THAT I WANT FIXED IMMEDIATELY:- If a worker breaks their tool, they will sit around the bonfire and cry about it. Let us create a work condition to let the AI workers repair their own stuff if under X% condition. The only time I feel any genuine annoyance is when I have to manually take someone's axe out of their inventory, duct tape it up right in front of them, and then hand it back to them. As of my current time in the game I have not seen anything to remedy this, and it puts a slightly annoying break in the otherwise nice automation chain.Side note: try equipping the dual blades and running back and forth between the trees as you sprint through the jungle. The camera is slightly slower than your character and it feels pretty cinematic, especially if you disable the UI. It's hard to describe what I mean, but the camera motion feels very good and that specific combination highlights it well."; 2 June Earl;
Soulmask;Heitri;NOT INFORMED;157 people found this review helpful; Recommended 31.9 hrs on record;Good game, very similar to conan exiles, crafting is a lot more complex and your captured tribesmen are actually useful for other than fighting, they can craft, patrol, transport and gather resources, anyone that complains that the amount of resources that they get is not enough is just not using the system properly.I do have one caveat, that is to say that you are not playing a character, you are playing as the mask, that is very important to consider and something the game does a poor job at explaining. Your mask allows you to take control of any tribesmen you capture and play as them.The thing is, you create your character, customize it, choose a name, all of that, but that character is going to be the worst character you will have, your initial body starts with a maximum proficiency of 50 (can increase it up to 70) on every single skill, meanwhile captured tribesmen can roll up to 125, they can also have class skills, and traits like self healing while standing still. Increasing your proficiency on weapons gives you more abilities to use with that weapon, and some passive perks that increase damage done, reduces stamina cost, things like that. Crafting proficiency makes crafting faster and gives you a higher chance of getting double the amount of crafts done.Obviously once you figure out all of that you realize that past a certain point you don't want to keep playing with your initial body, which is fine if you already know that going into it, but it feels weird if you find out about it in the middle of the game like me and my friends did.I do think this system is poorly explained, implemented and that they should change some aspects of it. I like the idea of playing as the mask and not just one character, but maybe they shouldn't make you create a character, customize it, name it, just to have it sit at the base for most of the game, You also have no way of getting rid of your initial body and it doesn't act as a normal tribesman, you can't make them craft, gather or do anything, they'll just sit there waiting for you to take control of their body again. Even if you could, they'll never be as good as a random outcast that you can find on the beach at level 1.I think they should just let you randomize the character and eventually permanently get rid of it, it would reinforce the idea that you are the mask and not that character, or just let you actually grow your main character into something useful, absorb other people's skills in some way, maybe build a temple to sacrifice other tribesmen and get their powers. I think a lot of people do want to mostly play as one character and giving the option to do that should be in the game as well.; 4 June Earl;

Having said that, this game offers a lot, and I mean A LOT of content. Some tweaks are needed here and there, but nothing that takes away from your experience. I'm just gonna rapid fire some of my favorite things about the game in hopes that persuades someone into supporting this game.Normal survival game functionalities ( needing to sleep, eat, drink) that don't feel like the grind is about to make you lose 5 years off your life.Yes you can have slaves.Boob jiggle physics turned up to 11.You can make pretty much any body type (thank you so much Devs <3).Breaking rocks scratches in itch in my brain I didn't know existed.The trees on the other hand just fall into an infinite void after chopping them down and it tickles my funny bone.TINY TURKEY.Building feels really, REALLY good. That's usually where some games lose me cause nothing is more frustrating then having to spend hours base building on janky mechanics.Haven't experienced anything in the way of bugs beside stumbling upon a dupe glitch on accident. Great day one EA launch and Devs put out a very promising road map. If you love survival games, Soulmask is definitely worth taking a deep dive on. Edit: It wasn't a dupe glitch. You have a chance of making more than what you set out to make. Tribesman pathing is a bit wonky. They constantly get stuck on each other even when you space out the area where they rest. But luckily there's a reset location option to band-aid the problem. Games still great and I'll die on that hill even though there's a percentage of gamers that can't read, have zero game awareness and probably not much survival game experience filling the review section with copium.; 31 May Earl;

I have a gun in hands and the advantage, but my entire current playthrough has been rather peaceful, so i opt for a non-violent solution. I duck behind the corner of a barrack and yell over direct chat that I don't want to kill him, and i circle around a stone wall trying to avoid line of sight. He answers, but it is intangible. I can't see him anywhere but I assume he went to the barracks. (1st person server btw) I try my best to not get in an awkward position and run up into the second floor of a house overlooking the military site. By the time I get there i can see that he has indeed closed the door in the prison building.The reason i was looting military sites was to find some AK74 mags. That was my entire reason for being there. I'd trade my M4 for a couple of those. I think about the chances of being killed versus the chance of him might having such a mag for trade. I know it's risky, but ???? it. I run up to the prison building and say I'm friendly and just wondered if we could do some trade.He accepts and tells me to come into the prison with my gun put away. This smells rotten eggs all the way to Rify, but I'm determined that my friendly intentions will serve me well.I enter, he is pointing at the door with an AUG. It's when i get closer to him that i see a second man with an AUG in the staircase. I explain what I'm trying to get and mid-sentence, a friend of theirs come in. He was likely watching the entrance. After a little meet&greet the say 'sorry, don't have any mags'. I say that's okay, and we agree that we wont go the same direction afterwards lest we run into each other again.I drop a black skull balaclava that i wasn't using as a token of gratitude for the friendly encounter and I'm on my way to Mishynko. Half way there, somewhere in the forest, I'm shot in the leg. Pants ruined, but legs not broken. I very briefly get some vietnam-level flashbacks to the time my roommate taught me the basics of ARMA and combat, and I jump behind a tree instead of just turning around. I count down from 10 and regain my breath. My M4 is equiped with an ACOG, and the shooter must have been about 100-150 meters away.I peek from the tree and see a man getting down on the ground by a bush. There's no peaceful solution to this conflict. My breath has gone down and I brace myself. peaking a second time with my rifle and shoot three rounds.One of them hit.I wait 4 seconds for him to likely have gotten behind a tree of his own to bandage. I start making a wide arch around him, moving as quickly and safely i can while preserving breath. I finally get to him and see he's unconscious.That's when i noticed it was the third guy from before, donning a black skull balaclava. I'm angry, but not disappointed. this is the nature of the game. While i still have him alive and able to hear me, all i can get myself to yell was ""I TRUSTED YOU"" before I shot him. Looting his body, I find 3 ak74 mags, an ammo box full of the right ammo, an LRS and some decent stores of food.

I heard some footsteps outside.The guy said ""hey"", and entered the house.I said ""hey"" back.He hit me with a hammer.This was the beginning of a beautiful tale... the tale... of the Shoe Gang.I ran out of the house and up the street as far and as fast as I could. I stopped and turned around to see if I was being followed by this crazy hammer man. I stood there, hungry and demoralised.Then there was a voice... ""Behind you, behind you""! Out of nowhere and in all his glory, another player... apparently much friendlier than my previous encounter.I told him what had happened in town. He charged off... ""Let's get this mother ??????"".Armed only with my ten fingers curled into balls, we ran at the Hammer Man, who after seeing our number had doubled, decided to take a more diplomatic approach.He apologised for hitting me with his hammer, and explained he simply wanted my shoes for his friend. Little did he know that I had just found the most pristine pair of shoes in the house where we first met.They were my shoes now.Agreeing to put our differences aside, the three of us teamed up in search of the finest shoes for the Hammer Man’s friend. We searched high and we searched low, but there were no shoes to be found. Finally, we met up with the shoeless man, whose shoes certainly were in a state of disrepair. Unable to tolerate the toes of the bare footed any longer, the four of us left town and made our way across the countryside.Sometime later, we encountered another survivor. He had a nice hat, but we weren't there for hats. He was clearly uncomfortable, and he was right to be, as the Hammer Man had been stashing a secret pistol this whole time. We were explaining our need for shoes when the Hammer Man went for the kill.Unknown to the survivor, the gun went to the back of his head. Hammer Man pulled the trigger. He completely missed the shot. Listening to the Hammer Man’s accent he appeared to be French, which for me, an Englishman, explained his inability to handle a firearm at 3 centimetres.The Hammer Man pulled out his primary hammer and bashed the survivor over the head. It was terrible to witness, and mentally scarring. Utterly traumatised, the rest of us piled in with our fists. We were careful not to hit his shoes, but it turned out that he too was wearing worn footwear. However, it was enough, and our friend fitted the loafers over his aching toes.The four of us marched on. The fields of Livonia seemed to stretch forever, and the rain began to fall. We found an old abandoned house, apparently half-shelled but yet still standing. One of the boys lit a fire in the fireplace.It was beautiful.We properly introduced ourselves. Bonds were formed. Shoes were discussed.It was a moment cut short. My saviour in town announced that his shoes were now unfit for purpose, and so our thirst for shoes was far from satiated.After much searching, my new friend had to go, leaving myself, the Hammer Man and his friend to fend for ourselves. We moved on... shoes won't wear themselves.The rain gave way and we pushed on, the scent of leather driving us through the forests. The three remaining members of The Shoe Gang took part in some fishing. We sat round a fire and cooked, and we discussed our shoe filled fantasies.We moved on and day began to turn into night. Darkness was our environment. Nature began to stir and the sound of wolves filled the air. It didn't take long. We were outnumbered. Our shoes were worn out, and they were upon us in the blink of an eye.Hammer Man was the first to fall, flailing his gavel relentlessly as the beasts took him. I attacked the alpha wolf with a big stick which only seemed to anger him. Soon everything began to fade, the blood loss was traumatic and I slipped into darkness. Many hours had passed with my new friends, and my last memories were of them dying.Darkness came. Silence followed. A loud ringing in my ears...The wolves killed us all.

They added microtransactions to increase their profit and claimed it was to extend the life of the game. While that might sound good, it was a flat out lie. They milked as much money as they could get and now have fired all the developers working on the game. They have killed off a fantastic game for the sole reason of greed. The investment firm never cared for the game or the fans. They only wanted to milk every cent they could and then shut things down.Anytime you hear Embracer group (or any other investment firm) have bought a studio, you can expect the same thing to happen. Don't buy microtransactions and support investment firms that will take your money and destroy the games you enjoy. Squad is now going down the same route. RIP NWI, you were an awesome studio. I hope the developers come together and form their own studio so we can continue to get great tactical shooters.;5 December, 2023;

Insurgency: Sandstorm;Farboud;NOT INFORMED;303 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 350.5 hrs on record;Ever since I played Insurgency 2014, I’ve never seen anything quite like it in terms of immersion, intense close quarters combat, and satisfying gunplay. So when I heard there was a sequel in the works, I was interested to see how it turns out. And after months of playing the Alpha and Beta phases, the game is now finally released.GameplayInsurgency: Sandstorm at its heart is a fast-paced tactical shooter. In order for the game to feel immersive, the HUD is minimalistic, and crosshairs are nowhere to be found. Firearms are a real threat and a couple of shots are enough to drop the enemies. For this reason, the gunplay is extremely satisfying. On top of that, an extensive arsenal of weapons is available to players to choose from. Currently, Sandstorm offers a Co-op mode vs bots and three PvP modes for small and large battles, with more content planned to be added after the launch. Other new additions include bigger maps, fire support, and vehicles.Visuals and SoundThe game looks very good, and weapons have been modeled with extreme attention to detail. Maps are now considerably bigger, and the added detail makes them more believable. There is a broad range of customizations available for the characters and seldom do they look similar. However, character models look lifeless, and their moving animations feel off.When it comes to sound design, Sandstorm truly shines. The Arabic accent of the Insurgents is superbly done. The explosions are deafening and powerful weapon sounds contribute to the enjoyment of gunplay. Further, gunshots sound different depending on the shooter’s position. Sandstorm is the kind of game that needs to be played with a good pair of headphones.PerformanceThe game’s performance has improved considerably since the start of the Beta phase, but it’s still nowhere as smooth as its predecessor. Overall, its optimization leaves a lot to be desired. While the game runs fine most of the time, occasional hiccups and frame drops are to be expected. Moreover, in my time with the game, I’ve witnessed all manners of bugs and glitches. Hopefully, given time, most of these issues will be patched.VerdictAs much as I enjoyed Insurgency: Sandstorm, It’s not a game for everyone. Playing it requires a bit of time, patience, teamwork and strategy and is aimed towards more mature players. As a long-time Insurgency fan, I was hyped for Sandstorm and the final product does not disappoint. I highly recommend checking the game out if you are interested in tactical shooters.;12 December, 2018;

Sifu;soapbubble;NOT INFORMED;93 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 9.8 hrs on record;"If I could describe Sifu in a single phrase, it would be ""Extremely challenging, extremely fun."" The most important thing you need to know is that you will die A LOT in this game, and each time you do, your character gets older. As each decade passes, your maximum health goes down and your damage goes up. If you die past age 70, it's game over. Chances are, you will be replaying levels so that you can finish one younger than you did before. This is because your youngest age at the end of the previous level is how old you are when you start the next one. To ensure that replaying isn't a slog, the game is designed so that after your first runthrough of a level, you will have access to shortcuts which skip large chunks of the level, if not nearly all of it. If you're someone like me who has played Sifu prior to its release on Steam, the main story will take you 2-3 hours. If you're new, well, the amount of time will vary significantly. Anywhere between 8-12 hours seems right. But if you're itching for more, Sloclap has you covered.After beating the main story, you have optional ""goals"" that you can do to unlock new outfits, many of which are references to iconic martial arts movies. There's also an arena mode which introduces a variety of new environments and levels to put your skills to the test.Overall, Sifu is an excellent beat-em-up game based on a martial art known as Pak Mei, which is similar to Wing Chun. For the layman who knows nothing about martial arts, basically Kung Fu. Its controls are simple but require good timing and general awareness of your ingame surroundings/opponents. If you want a relaxing or easy game, this isn't what you're looking for. But if you're up for a challenge and are a fan of martial arts movies, you've come to the right place.";8 April, 2023;

State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition;Khadgar;NOT INFORMED;288 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 22.4 hrs on record;Good game, but BUYER BE WARNED if you are looking for a co-op experience with a friend / friend group / significant other.Why it's bad:Short version: Only the host can progress in the game, the clients get virtually nothing relevant to long-term progression.Long version: To explain why this is bad, I will explain the basic gameplay loop.1) Explore around the map and look for items, resources, survivors, or complete quests.2) Return to your base with your loot / survivors.3) Upgrade your base / craft stuff / using your resourcesDuring step 1, you will get experience for your active survivor, leveling up their skills. You will get reputation, which is a currency which you can use to do lots of things, from upgrading stuctures, to recruiting survivors, to calling in airdrops of supplies. During step 3, you get to choose which buildings you want to build / upgrade, and you will chose based on which bonuses you want to give your settlement.For co-op clients in this game, you cannot acquire resources. You cannot acquire survivors. You cannot complete quests. You do get items such as guns and bandages, however. You do get experience, so your survivors can level up. However, if your survivor dies in co-op, they are dead no matter if you are the host or the client, but because you cannot recruit new survivors as a client... maybe you see where this is going. You can very quickly run out of survivors with no way to replenish them. Or, even if you don't have them die, you can't get new ones, so you're stuck with just whoever you had to start with, forever.As a client, you cannot upgrade the base. You cannot use most of the base facilities. You cannot take over outposts. You cannot use the outposts to learn new skills or receive any bonuses. You do not receive any bonuses from any of the base structures, such as passive health regeneration and so forth.What does this all mean? What it ends up meaning is that, if you are used to playing a game where 1 person hosts and everyone else joins, you will have a terrible f******g time playing this game. The host will have a normal experience, the clients will have a god-awful experience because they get basically nothing from playing. They will be using the same 3 starter people for the entire game and they will be p**s-poor at surviving because they don't get any of the passives from the base, they never rank up in standing with their own communities (so they don't get their powerful passives), and if they all die, that's it, your save file is deleted.The only way you can circumvent this is to either have the clients play the game solo on their own time, so they can actually make progress, or to rotate who is hosting, so you can take turns progressing.It's an absolutely bizarre game decision that only exists to solve the problem of having random public internet people join your game and mess with stuff, which is something I've never done, never wanted to do, and never had any desire to have happen, so the fact that all these 'protections' are put in place to prevent clients from interacting with the host's world is quite disappointing.Good solo game tho.;2 December, 2021;

State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition;Jill;NOT INFORMED;501 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 188.9 hrs on record;"This game has so much potential and I want to love it, but there's just so many things that make it incredibly frustrating.First off, the good: the early game is incredibly fun, searching for supplies, killing zombies, building your base. It has a very Walking Dead feel and the combat is incredibly satisfying, especially due to the great animations. The somewhat good, somewhat bad: character customization is lacking on the one hand (you can't create characters, just pick from randomly generated ones), but you can customize their outfits at least and leveling them and watching them become stronger by improving their skills is fun. Base building and exploration is fun for a while, until you realize how extremely limited it is. You get to unlock all these nice new buildings by completing the legacy arcs or recruiting survivors with the right skills, but then even the biggest base locations have so few spots, that you can only build a few of those. And you can also only recruit a small number of survivors (12), which leads me to the bad: endgame is SEVERELY lacking. Once you built your base and recruited the maximum number of survivors, there's really not much to do. You clear the map of plague hearts and finish your leader's story and that's it. Once you finish a leader's legacy arc, your game ends, you cannot keep playing your community and have to start over. There is not really an open-end sandbox mode, unless of course you ignore the main missions, but there's so little to do after a while, that it just get's repetitive. You basically just keep defending against random zombie attacks on your base, which usually takes between 1 and 2 minutes, clear the randomly popping up infestations (which takes about 1 minute) or do the same missions for random NPCs over and over (mostly driving them from A to B, giving them some resources or clearing a location for them). There is an achievement in the game for lasting 100 days in one of the 2 higher difficulty modes (they're not that difficult, ""normal"" is basically casual mode anyway), but after less than 10 days the repetition will probably already set in. So this achievement isn't difficult, but it's still hard to get, because the boredom will probably take over before you get even close to it.And then there's the bugs. Oh boy. I've lost track of the number of cars I've lost due to the buggy physics engine. Hit a small obstacle and if you're unlucky your car get's launched into the air, never to be seen again. Especially frustrating if you've got some good stuff in the trunk. And there's tons of other bugs, like missions being impossible to complete, because you have to kill all remaining zombies in an area, but then one or a few get stuck under the floor and you can't reach them, so you can't complete the mission. With mods I definitely had a somewhat fun time with the game, the early game is pretty cool, but what really makes this game a huge disappointment in the end, is the lack of proper endgame, balancing and more customization options (like bigger bases and communities).";20 June, 2020;

I'd recently ran out of gas, so I decided, what the heck, I'll just run to the nearest potential gas site... over half a kilometer away. This may not sound that far to you, but in the zombie apocalypse, half a kilometer on foot is like the journey your grandparents traveled to and from school back in their day: uphill both ways, in 5 feet of snow, with only a raw potato for lunch. But I'm no dummy. So before heading out, I grabbed a vial of plague cure, along with a bunch of stimulants, in case I happened to get into trouble...Flash forward about 45 minutes. My favorite character is sprinting back to base, having contracted blood plague for a SECOND time this trip, after using up the one vial of plague cure I brought along. The timer at the bottom left of the screen is counting down the seconds until my guy drops dead from the plague. Meanwhile, there are three. Count. THREE Ferals (cat-like zombies that run on all fours and hate you and everyone you know) sprinting after me. My dude is downing stimulants like they're fricken Tic Tacs, while hauling butt back to base. He's bobbing and weaving like he's the star of a new Rocky movie, as these ferals hurl past him every couple seconds trying to slice through him like warm butter. But my guy has quads of steel, glutes that could crack open a walnut, and enough stimulants in him to kill a small country, so he just keeps on trucking. I'm on the edge of my seat, actively shouting at the screen, squeezing my controller to death, and implementing any other proven tactics I can think of for increasing the speed of my character.Finally, I throw the door open to my base as my other community members gather to beat the ever-living heck out of these stupid ferals (it was a joyous moment). The timer has three seconds left on it as I down a vial of plague cure from my supply locker. My guy was safe. The relief I felt was better than having a scheduled phone call be canceled. Pure bliss.The next day, my favorite character ran into a bloater while driving, contracted blood plague, and was then beaten into the ground by a Juggernaut. Devastation... like going over to a friend's house for a sleepover and realizing you forgot to bring an extra controller.I will never forget you, favorite character, whose name has escaped me.Thank you, Undead Labs, for giving me this experience.

You can only move 450m from the host before you get teleported back to them. In an Open World Game, this already stifles enjoyment a lot. That alone would be fine if you had something to do while you wait, but you don't.The host is the only one who can expand the base and upgrade/use the different facilities. Exploring the map together is still enjoyable, but base management is an important part of this game, so it happens a lot. While the host is busy with that, you can explore maybe 5 locations near you, and once you've done that, you can only stand around. And the loot doesn't respawn or anything, so that way to pass the time only works the very first time you move to a new base.TL.DR: Fun game, multiplayer should be fun, but isn't";22 January, 2021;
State of Decay 2: Juggernaut Edition;a;NOT INFORMED;367 people found this review helpful67 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 788.7 hrs on record;Thumbs up or thumbs down? I only play SP, so it could have gone either way as SoD2 is a flawed gem. Why?Let's start with the BIGGIE - the gameplay 'loop'. There is a sort of iterative pattern players have to go through with most games (grinding, levelling, exploring, building, upgrading etc etc) each cycle through you get tougher, better gear, more options etc. That is true to a degree with gear in this game but the loop in SOD2 for everything is both very shallow and short (pick up some gear - help an enclave - get a person - get a bigger base - repeat). What is worse, do this 5-8 times and you are done, 'end game' - at this point you either start fresh (new game) or move to a new map with a couple of your survivors and....start fresh. In essence, there is no end game, no ultimate goal, you just grind and struggle so you are allowed to reset the grind and struggle (albeit with a leader bonus and 3 experienced characters to start the next map - which is actually a negative because being a small, weak, easily overwhelmed group when you start is the most exciting and fun part of the game. Now the quirky stuff:A tiny country village with a pre-apocalypse population of maybe 100 (going by the houses) has a zombie population of several times that - a zombie count that never decreases for any length of time no matter how many you kill. (this has had a patch to improve it but meh....still endless zombies re-spawning everywhere). A 4 door pick-up truck with a flat bed tray has 6 storage slots, each slot can be taken up by as little as 1 item - so your truck may be full if loaded down by 6 pieces of paper (which don't stack). A small backpack also has six slots ,also filled by 6 bits of unstackable paper, but it could also hold 6 fully automatic assault rifles if needed.Some of the roadside curbs in Spencer's Mill (a town on one of the maps) need you to jump to go from the road to the footpath.Wear and tear on equipment:A machete only 'works' for about 60 seconds of use, a kitchen knife driven repeatedly into human skulls works forever and ever and ever and ever.AI is broken, it's just broken, followers refuse to fight (you die) or they refuse to stop fighting and run with you from unwinnable fights (they die). Replacing people in this game is slow, boring, frustrating and just generally painful. Replacing a skilled specialist is...(hmm, I don't have a civilised word for that, insert your own adjective here)A fortified base designed in the apocalypse to protect survivors from zombie assault has 4 or 5 entry points, each 'blocked' by an unlockable, unreplacable and generally useless flimsy wire gate. Apparently 'fortification' and 'defensibility' are just long, meaningless, complicated words in this game world.The game has cars. Great !!!! One such car is a Pilato - arguably the best all-round vehicle in the game - it's a mid-sized SUV largely 'comparable' to say a Chevrolet Traverse. Chevrolet tells me the Traverse has a gas tank that holds around 20 gallons (90 litres) of fuel and on highways gets about 26 miles per gallon ( about 9.3 km per litre) so a Traverse has a maximum range of about 520 miles (830 km) per tank. The Pilato has range of about 6-7 km per tank...that's 4.4 miles in the 'old money'. This kinda makes 'Dieselgate' look like a storm in a teacup. Heartland DLC, 6 hours into a game on easiest setting, 3 people in my base, just completed first story-line mission and my base was assault by 3 Juggernauts, 2 ferals, 4 screamers, 4 bloaters and what I think was about 30+ regular Zs - WTF is insane difficulty like?My co-survivors CONSTANTLY complain about too many infestations - even when 90% of them are 2-3 km away on the other side of the map (they virtually reappear as quickly as you clear them) - who gives a s**t, we've got no food, no meds and 2 juggernauts patrolling our neighbourhood and you're worried about half a dozen Zeds setting up house in a ruined garage 3 km away ???!!! Go live somewhere else moron.Radio: 'Emergency, please help us...we're in trouble.' You get there and there's 3 guys kitted out with machetes and guns standing around in a garage, they ask you (and your companion if you brought one) to go to location X and get them some food. It's the apocalypse, I'm looking for food as well, why should the ONE or TWO of us go into the infested house when you THREE gun-toting dudes won't? Toughen up princesses !!! Call me for help when your base is being overrun by a horde of ferals because you only used wire gates to block the entry points - like we all did apparently.Missions flood in by radio. And I mean flood. Ignoring them loses you allies and/or damages morale. With your maximum 8 survivors you can only ever use 1 character (with optional companion) to do missions. It is literally impossible to help the whining, princess survivors all around you, clear infestations, deal with endlessly spawning hordes, repair and fuel vehicles, build the base, fix weapons and....so on. It's a shame, you feel like you are being constantly pushed into doing things you have no interest in doing when you really want to explore the map, hoard stuff, or whatever. Even taking the time to checkout the extensive wardrobe options for all the characters makes you feel like an ER doctor who just steps outside in the middle of an Earth-shattering crisis to update his/her Facebook page.Finally, there is the 'base building' - hmm...copy-paste limited is a good description. Each map has only 5-7 base locations, these are all abandoned houses or commercial properties, each with a set number built-in (and unchangeable) facilities and a number of empty 'plots' which can be used to place a facility of your choice. After a while you get your favourite base locations which you want to use and build the facilities that suit your game play style, end result.....this play through's base looks and actually is identical to the last play through. Both the appearance of the base (survivors never clean out the debris and detritus) and the one-click-to-build process are super unfulfilling.;19 March, 2020;

This game is an escape from the everyday stress and I can't recommend it enough. And it was developed by a one man army?! Like damn this man earned his flowers."; 6 March;

Euro Truck Simulator 2;SupremeSonic;354 products in account;718 people found this review helpful20 people found this review funny; Recommended 41.1 hrs on record;You know, it honestly feels like a joke at first. There’s thousands of games out there – some offer compelling storylines, others offer non-stop thrills, and pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life... And then there’s Euro Truck Simulator 2. Which, unsurprisingly, is a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of Europe. Okaaaay. To emphasise the absurdity of things, you only need to look at the basic gameplay loop that’s taking place here. you pick a job from a list of options in your area. You go and hitch up your cargo. Then you slowly trundle towards your destination, taking into account every road law and speed limit, and spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and never-ending strips of asphalt. After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 real-time minutes, you drop off the cargo – and do the whole thing again.Suffice to say, then, that this isn’t for everyone. there’s a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph. If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time, it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off... You’re instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming, allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your X-axis sensitivity for... Well, something. The tutorial then doesn’t help matters, basically stemming down to telling you “Just drive the truck”, and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place. Yet give it a chance to get things rolling and – amazingly and most crucially – it really works. There’s a bunch of reasons why this is the case, that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig. For one, there’s an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background, with the sat-nav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination. It’s surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping, and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing. Secondly, there's the option to turn on your own music while driving, or even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe. Set one of these up and hit the perfect moment, where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees, and it all just feels… Right. Heck, take my word for it when I say that having AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell” blasting out your speakers as you’re racing down the road at max speed is something that’s hard to beat. If you’re daring, you can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out... But just like real life, the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this. Still, it’s fun to try. In the game, that is. There’s also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well. Your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest, and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management, where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel. While it takes way too long if you’re not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt (so much so it actually gets a little frustrating), you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause. Suddenly you’re busy plotting out an empire, trucks roaming across all of Europe, and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account. You can even make the core game more complicated, if you’re that way inclined. An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice, but there’s nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually, or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy. The choice, as they say, is yours.It’s also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up – from the big changes to the little tweaks, there’s a lot you can bolt on to the base experience. Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos, or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles, there’s a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry. Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck – because there’s something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB-8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space. While not offered in the game or mods themselves (and I can't say I tried this myself), there’s also means out there to take things online, hitting the road with truckers all over the world. Chances are you’ll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere, but hey, whatever floats your boat. In the end, whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take what’s on offer, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience. with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road. It’s the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day, where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesn't appeal, and that's what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at.;27 April, 2017;

Unfortunately most fail, which has led to suspicion of ""cashing in"" when new titles arrive on the market.Green Hell has attempted a slightly different and much more realistic take on the genre, where micro-management is key to your success. And it's not bad, really!You see, most survival games balance their challenge with food, water and odd dangers, such as mutant babies or zombies. They scale your consumption to ridiculous levels (gallons of fluids and kilos of food every day) to supposedly balance their gameplay. By doing so, they reduce the realism of the players adventure and inject frustration in how much of a need there is to gather nourishment over all else. It seems to be the 'go to' formula for the generic survival game... Not so in Green Hell. There's pretty much everything you could want here. A large, sprawling rain forest that's been lovingly crafted in stunning detail (imagine Crysis on steroids). There's danger everywhere, from small parasites and insects to dangerous animals. The locals are also not happy you are in their territory, so inevitably they want to disrupt your progress (in small ways) and will even attempt to engage you in combat. Not enough to make it an irritation, but enough to have you on your toes and to raise your pulse. Even simple sounds can have you imagining the worst and set you on edge.Sustenance is very well integrated, with not just water or food, but a complex mixture of hydration, protein, fats and carbohydrates that all need attention if you don't want to suffer exhaustion, starvation, or even go mad and start hearing voices. Eating some foods can directly affect your sanity, such as eating human flesh or creepy crawlies. Cooking homely foods can soothe your woes and restore your sanity. All of this adds a complex and rewarding mini-game in itself. Although it can make the early days very demanding, it is a refreshing take on human needs in this genre of game.Crafting is also a real treat here. It's complex and hard work. There's no cutting down trees for 500 wood and spamming walls and items everywhere. Gathering is its own challenge, with weight issues and item availability being a core element to expansion of your home base should you decide to make one.The list of craftables starts small, meaning you ideally need to explore to discover how to make something. You can, however, experiment with smaller recipes and stumble into their various schematics (which unlock once crafted). So common sense is also your friend here! A nice little touch (similar to Minecraft) that makes the game feel more like a simulator than a game.Illness, injuries, parasites and other disabilities are also micro managed, with a knowledge of local herbs and plants essential to a speedy recovery. You need to consider your own hygiene. Being dirty makes a difference when eating or applying medicine. The consequence of which can be gross.TLDR:I'm still discovering many things as I play and am amazed at the love that's been put into the development of this game. It's truly a fantastic experience for anyone that's looking for a serious survival adventure that pushes your abilities of thought and reason. It's not for the feint of heart or the impatient. I'm not even sure it can be classed as a game. Simulator is a far more accurate description, but there is a story included (EA Tutorial, with the main story being added in v1.0 Official Release), which adds purpose.Extremely well executed and highly recommended!";17 August, 2019;

In the last few years we've seen a miriad of survival games come up on steam, fueled by the apparent appetite for building/survival games that became obvious through the countless free-to-play mobile games dedicated to the genre. The problem is that, on the PC ecosystem, developers always seemed to think that survival/building mechanics by itself wouldn't be enough to set them apart from competition, so they always came with a twist to the gameplay. Either focusing too much on building and nothing in survival, or too much on survival and with little to build. Massive place-holders for your constructions - like Space Engineers. Dedicate your life or start over every day - like Rust. Ultra-grind like Conan Exiles. Dabling into super-natural horror like The Forest. Going unfinished for years on early access - like The Long Dark. Others are just so easy that in 2 hours you figured out how to do everything. Others so incomplete that you lack either parts, blocks, or working mechanics to be able to go all in. Some with crappy dishonest developers, like Ark. I played many of them. But for all I've played i couldn't find one that would get the fundamentals right. Strip them all down to the basics, the building and survival mechanics, and;10 September, 2019;
Green Hell;articfire77;NOT INFORMED;611 people found this review helpful87 people found this review funny; Recommended 64.7 hrs on record;Start with nothing and no idea how to survive. Die a few times, and figure out the basics: you can eat this, you can't drink that. Die a few more times from parasites or disease, and discover which plants have medicinal properties (and pay for that knowledge with poisoning or death a few times). Survive longer, build weapons, defend yourself from enemies and predators. Eventually, you know every food and water source, can crush every enemy, can build anything you need. You are more than a match for anything this inhospitable world might throw at you. Nature regards you with awe: you are the King of the Jungle.Then step on a scorpion far from your camp. Your bandages with antivenom herbs are back at camp. Stumble around looking for the herb you need. Your fever rises. Pass out on the forest floor. Wake up: parasitic worms hiding in the muddy ground have made a home under your skin. Use a bone fragment as a needle and dig them out. Pass out from the pain.You wake up dangerously dehydrated, and your makeshift coconut canteen already drained. Making it home is your only hope. You start in the right direction, but the combination of the fever, the now infected scorpion sting, and the open sores from your impromptu worm surgery have weakened you so that you can only make it a few hundred yards in between passing out. Your periodic unconsciousness gives more worms the opportunity to claim a new home. The fever rises. Dehydration worsens. Hunger racks your body. You hope the growl you heard was just a mouse, and not a jaguar hunting you. Irrelevant, as you pass out again. You can make it, less than a mile to go. Medicine, food, water, fire, and rest all await you. Just a little further.You stumble one last time, and fall to the ground. This time, you don't rise again. Throat parched, delirious with fever, body covered in wounds and sores. Your vision fades to black.Scavengers consume your body, and the sun bleaches your bones.

Green Hell;bansource;NOT INFORMED;356 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 79.5 hrs on record;For those wondering how different this game is from the forest, here's a perspective from someone who owns both games.The main difference is that green hell isn't a power fantasy like the forest. In the forest you can blow up mutants and cannibals with molotovs and bombs. Or use fire arrows or flares to light enemies on fire. You can also upgrade you weapons with stuff like human teeth and bird feathers to give them a stat buff. Green hell is less combat focused. You get different tiers of tools and weapons, with stone being basic tier and metal being the best tier. That's about it, you can't blow up jaguars or natives with bombs or light them up with flares.Green hell does have tribal native people, but they are much less of a nuisance. They don't spawn often and even if they do, they won't send waves of tribals near your location. They spawn, and if they spot you and you kill them all, it won't escalate any further like things do in the forest. There are only two main types of tribal people, archers and spearmen, no Virginia mutants or cave mutants. Again, it's less focused on combat.Enemies in the forest are all human based. In green hell, there's more variety, you get jaguars, mountain lions, caiman and other hostile animals. And these animals don't ???? around and an unprepared encounter can easily spell death. A leaf bandage will do fine against scratches but it won't do anything against a deep jaguar laceration. It depends on if you have the knowledge to treat the laceration, better yet, kill any animals before they can even harm you. That said, it takes knowledge and skill, since you all you have are spears and bow/arrows, no molotovs or bombs.Food and water is also much deeper in green hell. You have different nutrients such as proteins, fats and carbohydrates, so eating a piece of meat won't replenish your carbohydrates, it's less like the forest where you can likely survive off a single food source. And this mechanic isn't here just for the sake of variety, failing to satisfy any one of these nutrients can lead to reduced health and stamina, which can further affect your ability to survive.This is a good segue into stamina. Stamina in green hell is also very important, it doesn't just affect your movement and combat. If your stamina and energy fall too low, you'll pass out on the spot. This will then lead to parasitic worms living underneath your skin, rapidly draining your sanity, which if left untreated can spell another death. So to stop yourself from passing out and getting worms, you need to sleep regularly on a bed. Stamina also dictates if you can light a fire, unlike the forest, you don't have a Bic lighter with infinite fuel, you need to start a fire with a drill firestarter, which uses a substantial amount of stamina and energy. If you don't have a fire, you can't purify and boil water, or cook any raw meat you have. Foods in green hell expire quickly if you don't cook or eat them.Next is the sound design. Green hell's sound design doesn't just sound good, it is also very very crucial to survival. In the jungle, there's an overgrowth of bushes and trees, so it's very easy to miss any threats that are around you, such as rattlesnakes, giant ass spiders, tribal people and Jaguars. The only reliable way to identify these threats is by the distinct sound in which they make. Hear a snake rattling? Stop moving any closer and go around the source of the sound. Hear the low growl of a jaguar inching closer? Get ready for an encounter. Hear the singing of tribal people? Crouch down and avoid alerting them. Because more times than not, you won't be able to see these threats. In the forest, you can turn off sound completely and still stay alive, but in green hell, turning off sound will get yourself killed by various threats.Lastly, I want to talk about difficulty. So far I've built up green hell to be this hardcore survival game, whether it is 100% realistic or not is still debatable with sometimes questionable AI patterns, but in its core, green hell is a hardcore survival game. That said, it's actually very customizable in its difficulty. Don't want to get bit by snakes and spiders? You can actually turn it off, don't want to deal with tribal people? You can turn it off as well. Don't want to deal with sanity, there's another option for that as well. It's much more customizable than the forest. You can go in blind and get killed over and over again. But like any hardcore game, it can be very rewarding. If you want to challenge yourself or just want to play like an Amazonian tourist, you can customize the difficulty to your own liking.;15 May, 2023;

I wanted to have plenty of time put into it with it being an early access title. I've played mainly solo, most games like this I do, just a personal preference until I have beat the game. This game is an early access, the only bug I have ran into is an item tooltip describing what the item is. The game feels completed even though it is not. You can’t say that for a lot of early access games now a days.Let's start off with the Building aspect this game offers. The terraforming can take a little to get used to. You can’t just dig with a pickaxe underneath the layer above, you must take it all the way down. With you not being able to dig a cave, you must dig the whole area out and build in the area if you wanted to build an underground dungeon for example. You unlock building items as you progress through the game, I like this aspect, I suggest waiting until the final tier if you plan to build fancy. While building you must add support, just like in the real world, cool concept. You must be within a certain distance of a workbench, forge, or stonecutter while building. Certain building aspects require a different crafting table.Now let’s talk about combat. Combat in this game can be very challenging if you are under geared. You can’t go from the tier 1 zone and expect to survive in combat in the tier 3 zone. There are creatures that can 1 shot you if you are not prepared. Eat the right food for more health and have the right gear for the zone on! The boss fights I enjoyed in this game. What more can you ask, fighting a deer with chains hanging off his antlers while metal music starts playing? Mobs from one biome will fight others from another! It seems skeletons will fight any mob even if they are from the same biome. It can be a sight to roll up on some greydwarves trying to fight the skeletons It can take time to acquire the materials to craft gear sense you can’t use a teleport with ore. This means you either walk, or travel by boat.Traveling by boat can bring a lot of great views. Watching a storm while in the middle of the ocean, a lightning bolt dancing across the sky. Shortly after being able to watch the clouds dissipating, the stars shining with a purple hue in the sky can be mesmerizing. Some people may not enjoy the graphics of the game, say it looks too old. It’s the perfect art style for this game in my opinion. The physics in this game are amazing. You chop a tree down and it factors in slop, chopping direction and wind into its fall direction. There’s rain and snow fall in the game, which can cause you to become “wet” and “freezing.” Crafting in this game is well done for the most part. In my opinion there is a few recipes that need to be tweaked. You shouldn’t need 20 of iron bars but only a small amount of wood to craft a bow for example. Drop rates for crafting mats seem well placed except of ancient wood, my opinion, it needs to be lowered to same levels as the other “special woods.” You can plant a garden, plant trees, tame animals to have quick access to furs and meat.After many hours of crafting, combat, building, and exploring, a game that is 1gb (Yes 1gb!) has brought me a ton of fun. Reminds me of the first times playing Minecraft or Terraria. I’ve been looking for a game to bring that feeling back.All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these style of games as I do! Please if you enjoyed reading this or found it inciteful upgrade this review!I’ll see you in Valheim!I just want to say thanks for all the awesome feedback of my review.. sorry I live in Texas and have been without power for 3 1/2 days.

From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.I truly appreciate that they didn't make an ""open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them"". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.";19 February, 2021;

I would highly recommend this game to anyone reading this review. to play alone or with up to 9 friends. I have not encountered a single bug and, while this is an early access game, this is a full experience. Some key features that drew me in and resulted in my slight addiction are below:Soundtrack and graphics - The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and chill af. There were times i found myself working on my laptop with valheim running in the background, just so i could listen to the calming melodies of the soundtrack and the soft crackle of the fireplace in my base. The lighting and atmosphere are really top notch. The low resolution style was almost a turn-off for me when researching this game and watching videos. However, once inside the Valheim world, i saw it is truly beautiful and worth experiencing. Discovery - The second thing that really drew me into Valheim was this feature where once you pick up a new inventory item for the first time, you will then discover crafting recipes associated to that item. This, as opposed to being awarded items for leveling up, felt very enticing. It made me want to explore to find new items, and to push into more unforgiving lands for the rewards the items there may have. This left me feeling like there was always something more out there to discover. There are items in the game which currently have no function, leaving some excitement to see what they are used for once that becomes available. Even after defeating the 5 current bosses and thinking i had complete the game, there were 2 biomes i had never even seen and more items to discover. Development - The Devs have a roadmap that is widely accessible and clear on their plans for the future of the game. Personally, I have no social media accounts, but even through steam they post development blogs to keep the community in the loop with their plans.;20 December, 2021;

I have just under 2000 hours but have been playing this game for well over 10 years.. To be exact March 8th 2009. (as my badge says)I may be a no one in the community, but I have been supporting this game since I first played. The game I would always come back to and call ""home"".I, over the years have made friends, enemies, servers.. Learnt different modes, meta, styles, languages.. I have been through multiple events like, The Sniper vs. Spy Update, Classless Update, the big 119th updates update (no joke..) Solider vs Demoman, Scream Fortresses, Christmas updates! You get the point..There is no sparkle to this game anymore, I cannot jump on a 118 ping New York server, late at night waiting for the Americans to get back online in the evening, me and Banksy taking on 2Fort as Demoman to kill all soliders so that the Demoman could have his own weapon? (Spolier: Solider won, welcome to the Gunboats..) Then finding out TF2 came onto Mac and people that had it, got the ear buds, that sold well.. To be fair, I could go on and tell my war stories, but that feeling when the family gets a new puppy and you get shut out as no one is interested in you anymore? This is exactly whats happening with TF2 (dev side).. I always check steam stats and there is always over 50k people playing, always top 10 on the chart but something is missing..As part of the community, us loyal people that cherish this game, we are the backbone to this beautiful creation. You don't see Blizzard (well not all the time) not maintaining their beautiful creation and of course World of Warcraft is older then this.. Maybe because of the paid subscription, but I am sure that TF2 alone use to get more money as a free to play game at one point. (Jeeze I had to pay for TF2 over 10 years ago..)I mean ok, fair play, you have a new game coming out.. whooptie doo.. Send all the cavalry towards that.. Yet instead to the people who grew up with TF2, old players and new players. People who have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars for now a game which to me is dying.. Not the people's fault, but your own selves..Jumping into a casual game (YOUR servers) to be greeted by not one sniper but three sniper ""bots"" that have their own way-points, spamming ""good shot mate"", aim botting, auto spamming chat so no one can see whats written as a wall of blank appears and calling no when someone votes them a ban. When there is 3 or more of them they win the no vote anyway..When making your own stuff glitch gets patched.. finding glitches in the items_game text file gets patched.. Oh yeah I forgot that's your profits going down the drain.. But don't worry as bots and hackers are not, so were forget about it.. the game.. the people, who truly love and support this game..Excuse the rant but for a game that still, to me at this dire moment, is still rocking the steam charts, this should be dealt with within a matter of days or weeks.. There are no new updates like the Solider vs Demoman.. The love for this game from you, just has vanished.. I will carry on playing as I still love this game and class this as home. But for now, don't expect me to dedicate my time or spend money on anything till this ""bot"" situation and other stupid stuff is dealt with.. and hopefully soon. With new updates that sparkle in my eyes.. And a new bloody weapon for the Demoman as I deemed the solider win was unfair.";15 December, 2019;

Cities: Skylines II;do;NOT INFORMED;1,717 people found this review helpful10 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 246.0 hrs on record;After spending almost 150 hours in this game it’s safe to say I’ve given up.I’ve mostly ignored all the comments at first so that I can give an impartial view of this game. Foremost, Cities Skylines 2 is broken. It is riddled with many serious algorithmic and performance bugs that affect core functions of the game. Widely reported bugs such as frequent crashes and taxation glitch, which causes unexpected income and deficit spikes that breaks the gameplay — and this is just one of many serious ones out there While it is understandable for bugs to be present in games and software, Colossal Order’s lack of urgency and genuine interest in tackling bug reports makes it unacceptable. It’s been 3 months since launch, yet recent statements from the company were deliberate in evading questions on roadmaps for bug fixes, and attempt to obfuscate users by saying that something is being worked on for the near future. Hard to believe that this is the same company that made Cities Skylines 1 — a realisation of what the company once was. For now, stay away until more is done. —(Quick update — 29 Jan)I’ve given this game another shot with a fresh install and a new city — issues remain and let me summarize my experience- At first glance, Cities Skylines 2 provides many quality-of-life improvements compared to Cities Skylines 1, such as better road building and modern assets. - You’ll find that it is now a breeze to build roads, highways and intersections, tools are intuitive and easy to use. Want an intersection? Just drag across an existing road and you’ll have an intersection. Want a roundabout? Just plop it down. - Assets are refreshed as compared Cities Skylines 1, gone are the cartoonish buildings and vehicles. However, most of the gamebreaking issues start occurring as you progress into the game. Game stability and optimization- As your population increases, game simulation will slow to a crawl — despite my setup being well above the recommended specs - Occurs on my two different cities and save files.?Service Mechanics- Garbage management and healthcare vehicles will regularly depart from their facility and return almost immediately (alerts will popup frequently that healthcare and garbage management is inadequate despite well within their capacity)- Buses, trams and trains will frequently and randomly despawn or stop working completely. Economy and industry- Taxation for industries will become highly erratic due to an algorithmic bug, taxation income will fluctuate randomly by the millions for a town of 10k citizens. Completely breaks the budgeting and financial system. - Local industries will not export goods, cargo terminals (both air and train) will hoard all mail and breaking the mailing system (also impacts citizen happiness)- As confirmed by many others, due to a land value bug, prices will increase to astronomical levels, which makes residential suitability zero for most parts of your city and its outer suburbs. - This the most critical bug since it completely stops the progress of your city and game, as residential demand will be zero, and no new citizens can move in.?These are just some of the numerous bugs I came across while playing this game —; 20 January;
Cities: Skylines II;Authorial;NOT INFORMED;4,244 people found this review helpful85 people found this review funny; Recommended 312.5 hrs on record;"There's two directions I can take this review. One is ""I recommend, but ..."" and the other is ""I don't recommend, however ..."", and they're both probably going to say the same things. Strap in, and grab a cup of hot chocolate, daddy's gonna tell stories again:If I compare my experience playing the first game on release to this one on release, this one is much, much better. But how?The original Cities: Skylines was a relief from the crushed dreams of SimCity fans. It came in as the rightful conqueror of the city building genre, and built a huge community of gamers, designers and modders that have influenced the growth of the game since. It refined the SimCity style beyond expectations, it broke the gridded city building style, it introduced gamers to urban design and planning ideas that they have never thought of before, and a whole sub-genre of urbanist YouTubers rose up from this. However, when you compare the two vanilla games, without the mods and DLC and hundred of YouTube content creators, the first game is great, but a bit empty. It didn't start with a day-night cycle, that was added in After Dark. It didn't start with many of the best transit options, they came in later DLCs. Inland water treatment plants didn't exist until 2020 with Sunset Harbor.Cities: Skylines 2 starts with everything that the base game should have. It doesn't only have a day-night cycle, it has seasons. It doesn't just have different zoning densities, it has mixed use zones. You don't just place down industry building and print money, the game has a diversified economy, hearkening back to SimCity2000 when you could individually manage tax rates for different industries, but here you can do that to the entire economy. You can encourage and develop an economy based on retail and services, or primary industries, or manufacturing of any kind. You don't just have buses, trains and planes, you have the option to use taxis, buses, trains, trams, subway metros, planes and boats to transport your people and cargo outside cars and trucks. To build the city you don't just lay down roads, you can plan curves and bends and intersections using the various feedback that it gives you, create clean interchanges and intersections, and use a variety of tools to limit turns and eliminate traffic conflicts. You can even obverse traffic accidents affect your roads and disasters affect the city, pollution affecting the environment and a myriad other things that you didn't even think of when the original was released in 2015.Compared to that, yeah, no questions.So why is everyone saying ""Yes, but ...""?I won't repeat it in detail, you've already read the other reviews. Basically, expectations for the game's performance and delivery were misaligned between the developers, the publishers and the consumers. Performance issues were a huge problem right off the bat because most people do not have systems that meet the requirements of the game, but the developers have been tasked with making the game suitable for console. Misaligned expectations. The game's economic system was too opaque to clearly understand what was going on, to the point that unsubstantiated rumours began spreading that the economy was fake (it's not). Feedback to the user was not adequate to completely understand what was going on, and many players assumed things were bugs when they were not. Misaligned expectations.However, the performance issues and opaque UI feedback aside, none of this was helped by the myriad of bugs that have since seen six major patches to clean up, with more work to come out after the Christmas holidays.Finally, to nail the point home about misaligned expectations: content. I came in to the original game in March 2015, right on release. I was with it the whole way through. I was there when the beacons were lit and Gondor called for aid. I didn't even bother using mods until 2019, because that's when they were interesting and mature enough to really make a difference in the game. By the time the Great Plague of 2020 hit, the original was primed to receive huge interest in the game. Content on the workshop exploded. YouTubers exploded. Everything exploded. It was wild! So when, in early 2023, the new game was announced, a host of gamers came in with huge content expectations and none of the context. YouTubers speculated on the most insane speculations, people were having meltdowns about the new engine staying on Unity instead of hopping over to Unreal Engine. Wild.And so on release, despite having literally been released with more tools and content than city builders have ever had, with all of the good ideas from everywhere in the broader community being incorporated into the base game, the chief criticism was a lack of content. The game felt empty. Grey (UK)! Gray (US)! Graey (WTF)! Critiques went from blasting CS1 for being too cartoony to blasting CS2 for being too realistic with its browns and concretes. At this point, I stopped listening to shameless and pointless, often contradictory criticism and looked for genuine concerns.These are easy to list:- the game is still in need of more performance fixes- the game's UI needs more obvious indicators of what's going on with underlying systems- the game is a resource H-O-G- tools still feel a bit unrefined- there are missing options that would make things so much nicer (props, prop tools, decorative tools, etc)- no mods at the moment, we want mods- no editors, no map editor, no asset editor, none of that yet- console version still needs to be released- the bug issues have delayed the Ultimate Edition's Q4 and Q1 DLC releases- there are still some major bugs that require further investigationTo be frank, though, my stance is straightforward: bugs can be fixed, and these issues will be ironed out over time. The devs have repeatedly shown that they intend to see this through.So yes, ""I recommend, but ..."", be mindful of the things that are still to be fixed, and you may enjoy the game. ""I don't recommend, however ..."", set your expectations appropriately and you will realise this game has enormous potential to be the definitive game of the city simulation genre.

So does CS2 solve these issues? Some of them yes, but they managed to screw up a bunch of other things.The goodThe new road tools are the best thing the new game does and allow for the same level of road building as modded CS1, but with far less effort and time. The new buildings look much nicer and are far more consistent than CS1's vanilla ones.The mehPerformance is playable, but I had to lower the graphics settings. (Ryzen 3600 RTX 2070)There's also a lot of attention to detail things that are missing that CS1 had but I cba to list at the moment.The badThe simulation isn't just inadequate, it's a downgrade from CS1's. I could list all the bugs and issues people have had, but other reviews have already covered that, so I'll sum it up as simulation feels utterly disconnected to what you're building, which is even more annoying when you consider that CS1 was actually okay in this regard.The solution to traffic jams in CS1 was to use the pathfinder tool to find where cims were going and where the bottlenecks were, they removed it in CS2 and have flat out said they won't re-add it. I suspect the reason for this is because if they did it would reveal how broken the ""simulation"" actually is.Although the road builder is great there is no smooth slope tool like the fine road anarchy mod had, this is a minor complaint and could easily be fixed with an update.Another issue is the way buildings affect terrain, a crematorium just flattens the land, having visited an IRL crematorium I can assure you this is definitely not how they work. The grid system also hasn't been improved since CS1, so we can't have nice connected EU buildings.Then there's mod support, for some reason Paradox is ditching the Steam workshop for their own service, which could have questionable longevity and support. Mod support was coming shortly after release[forum.paradoxplaza.com], there still isn't official mod support after 3 months, but the beta will be starting soon™.Closing thoughtsDo I regret buying this game? No, I got plenty of time out of it and I really enjoyed playing with the road tools, plus I got it from a dodgy key reseller so I didn't pay full price, if I did pay full price I'd be pretty pissed. I also think that if you are a hardcore CS1 player, you will probably find some fun in this.Honestly I have little faith for the future of this game, Paradox seem to be more interested in saying ""it is what it is"" than sorting out all the bugs and design issues, making CS2 a glorified city painter, something that modded CS1 was already really good at if you could be bothered to invest the time. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe they will fix the simulation, or more likely a modder will, in which case this would make a good base for an amazing city builder.The greed and rushed development may have got Paradox a quick profit, but it has resulted in a base game with fundamental flaws that cannot be patched out, and while they may have the money of suckers like me now, we are less likely to stick around and buy the DLCs, which are the real cash cow. As Gaben said, ""Late Is Just For A Little While, Suck Is Forever"".Should you buy this game?Right now, at full price? God no, wait for a sale, 50% would be justified for a city builder enthusiast, 80% for anyone else."; 8 February;

THIS GAME ONLY HAS LOCAL SPLIT SCREEN CO-OP STORY MODE With that being said, the story mode is fun/interesting, and has been one of the better Resident Evil games in recent years (and by that I mean from 2010 until now) with Resident Evil 7 being on top, and Resident Evil Revelations 2 following behind it and a high potential to be taken over by Resident Evil 2 remake.There is a way to play with friends on Steam, and that is only through Raid Mode. Which works similar to how the first Revelations Raid Mode did. However I feel that this cannot, and does not warrant spending the money on the game for. Raid Mode is fairly repetitive and you'll find yourself getting progressively more and more bored with it.Other than the fact that the CO-OP only exists through Local play, the game is good, and I highly suggest picking it up during a sale.;23 December, 2018;

Resident Evil Revelations 2;Raid;NOT INFORMED;329 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Recommended 63.6 hrs on record;The following is a review of the game from a long-time Resident Evil fan.Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a decidedly low-budget affair, it's not particularly graphically impressive and there is a level of jank to it all. However, behind this lays what may be one of the stronger Resident Evil games in years that manages to be a solid episodic title, a solid survival-action game, and more atmosphere and horror-oriented and feeling more like 'Resident Evil' than probably the last several RE games combined.Now I say that as someone who actually liked Resident Evil Umbrella+Darkside Chronicles, RE5, Revelations 1, and Resident Evil 6 well enough for what they were. RE5 and RE6 were fun action co-op games for me, RE5 was a fun arcade shooter with some fun monsters, RE6 had some fun combat mechanics with a sort of uneven-quality campaign but great Mercenaries. Revelations 1 was okay, I enjoyed it well enough, but its handheld origins showed strongly and really, the design of the game was kind of dull at times, and it never quite gave that classic Resident Evil feel it claimed it would.;20 April, 2015;

Resident Evil 2;RE3;NOT INFORMED;217 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 157.7 hrs on record;This game is what other developers should aspire to when creating a remake. It is hands down the best remake I have ever played.I remember getting this game for my birthday in third grade and my little brother watched me play for what felt like an eternity. That sparked my brothers' obsession with the resident evil franchise. I, however, did not play much of the following titles in the series. I would watch him here and there and watched the movies. I ended up getting an Xbox and Halo was my obsession. With the remake of the third one and RE: Village on the way I figured it was finally time for me to really wet my whistle with what Capcom has to offer. This game is by far more terrifying than anything I remember playing in third grade. Parts in the original that have been implanted into my cerebral cortex out of sheer terror back then have now manifested themselves into brand new nightmares thanks to the modern revamp of the games engine with the graphics being some of the most realistic horrors I've seen even in Hollywood movies. I'm on my third or fourth playthrough and I still scream like a little girl at parts. The game is ??????? terrifying. Between lickers popping out of vents, the 15-foot terminator known as Mr. X chasing you all over the ??????? place, zombies behind doors, in lockers to WHATEVER THE HELL those things in the sewers are... it's enough to give you a glimpse into quite possibly, what Hell is. Iconic cutscenes, boss introductions, and other favoritable parts have been altered or changed in a way that keeps the game fresh but still so grounded to its core roots. Giving new players a great and new experience while giving the veteran players something to smile at in nostalgia. Perhaps one of my favorite things in this game is the dismemberment. Really gives you that dead space sense of cutting your enemies down to a meat sack of nothing before pumping a few more rounds into their heads to make sure they're not getting back up. The only thing I wish this game had was more content. Yes, I know there are bonus missions but that still is not enough. I just want more. Sadly,;24 January, 2021;

I kept going, perfecting the fighting style until I reached the game's first real boss. It knocked me down again. I fought that boss over and over again until the swordplay became a lethal kind of dance. I felt invincible. After the first boss, I went onto the next one, and the next, until I completed the game's first ending. Then I played it all again, exploring the abilities, fighting styles, and story arcs that I hadn't tried before. I reached the game's truly final boss and killed it in one try because the game had trained me to fight so well. It was by far the most rewarding experience any video game has ever given me. After over 150 hours, I earned every single achievement.From someone who refunded this game the first day they played it, from someone who would have never been remotely interested in Japanese culture otherwise, let me tell you that Sekiro is one of a kind. Not only is the combat an art-form in and of itself, but the story is moving and the characters compelling.If you buy Sekiro, don't get frustrated when you hit a wall. Don't look up cheese strategies or try to savescum the game. Get back up, watch a walkthrough or two if you really need to, and vault over that wall like a f***ing shinobi.

Overall, it feels like a return to the roots. Remember, the very first Alone in the Dark (3D) was an inspiration for the Resident Evil series. So, in a way, the cycle has now come full circle. Please also keep in mind that developers have deadlines tied to funding and contracts with publishers. They've done their best to deliver a good product, but it appears there's still a need for optimization and additional QA. Hopefully, Pieces Interactive will fine-tune this, and the game will garner enough sales to become a classic in future.

Even if I hadn’t grown up with the original, I’m not sure I’d find myself being that impressed. I really do like the art direction and music, but gameplay-wise? This is hardly survival horror. Extremely linear and scripted enemy encounters remove any sense of dread you would normally expect from the genre…Not to mention its almost complete lack of replayability. (Unless you are a completionist, there aren’t any worthwhile reasons for collecting every lagniappe on repeated playthroughs.) It’s a shame, because I was really pulling for this one. however, there are just too many great competitors to really recommend, even when considering the budget.Speaking of which, I also wholeheartedly disagree with the “pretty good for AA” argument. Robocop Rogue City released this year and had great gameplay. Within the genre, games like Crow Country and Signalis prove that you don’t need a huge budget to make a great survival horror experience. Unfortunately I’d say skip it unless you can get it for half the price or lower. I’m hoping we get another reboot attempt - I doubt this one will get a sequel. Maybe one which emphasizes and expands upon what made the original so great and groundbreaking for its time.; 27 May;

You can't get much cozier than behind the electronics at a radio station. The warm glow off all those lights of that equipment. Buttons you can actually push. A warm cup of coffee. The comfort of your producer behind the glass in the next studio. Different people to talk with. Puzzles to solve. Then without spoiling it, getting to up and explore the studio. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the interface was clunky at times when putting objects down. There could have been a few more puzzles. Some of the dialog sections were kind of long winded and dragged on, but that's still better than if there weren't enough. And although they were some fun characters, sometimes they were a bit too goofy in the face of such a serious tone. Oh and choices really do matter here! And adding some more people to the building would make it even warmer and cozier than having just 2 people and the whole place empty!;13 November, 2023;

Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links;MemesAreGood;547 products in account;166 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 248.5 hrs on record;"It's not 100% real YuGiOh due to the 3 card monster and spell/trap limit as well as no Main Phase 2. If you're looking to learn real YuGiOh either download YGOPro or/and buy Legacy of the Duelist here on steam.Here is a list of the differences from real TCG yugioh and Duel Links:-Both players start with 4000LP-Both players begin with 4 cards in their hand-Main Phase 2 is completely absent from the game. In other words, after your battle phase is complete you must end your turn.-There are only 3 monster and spell/trap card zones on the playing field.-20card decks are the minimun.-30card decks are the maximum.-5 Monsters in extra deck is the maximum.-No Synchro, XYZ, Pendelum OR Link summons.-Characters will unlock a ""skill"" as they level which can be attached to a deck individually and activated in a duel when the conditions are met. For example, Yami Yugi has an ability called ""Power of Dark"" which allows him to play ""Yami"" at the very beginning of the duel for free right after the coin toss. The card is materialized from thin air and does not come from his deck.With these differences some cards in this version of YGO are a lot more powerful due to the lower LP start and smaller decks. So you can definitely have some quick fun and pull off combos that you probably could hardly do in official YGO. Also, the voice acting is very nicely done.For some people the differences between Duel Links and offical YGO may be a turn off. So I just want to make sure that you know the rules of this game and what you're getting into before you start investing in it.";24 December, 2017;
Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links;Hycic;NOT INFORMED;292 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,424.7 hrs on record;I've played over 4000 duels on the mobile version as I'm writing this, and I'm sure I have at least a few hundred hours invested into this game. I enjoy playing this game a lot, and I'll explain why this game is worth my time here.For a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh veterans like myself, the newer, flashier, modern TCG is too fast and lacks strategic depth. Synchro summoning may be passable for some, but XYZ, Pendulum, and now Link summoning is... weird. We miss Tribute and Ritual summoning, and we enjoy the slower format of the game.Konami is aware of our demographic, and that's why Duel Links is so appealing to people like me. It brings the game closer to what we originally enjoyed from the TCG. Sure, some adjustments were made like smaller decks and a smaller playfield, but the essense of the original game is still captured here.As a F2P game, it's natural to be concerned about this game being P2W. I won't lie, you can get a pretty big advantage by paying real money. Let me make a case for playing without spending money though. If you compare Duel Links against Hearthstone, Duel Links shine in many areas. As a F2P Hearthstone player, you log in each day, grind out your quests and maybe grind out some additional currency by winning games. If you're a new player, you're likely up against veteran players who have accumulated a large pool of cards making it hard to play against them, which makes your own accumulation of cards rather unenjoyable.In Duel Links, PvE is a massive part of the game. Yes, it's grindy, but not in the same unenjoyable manner as Hearthstone. PvE scales as you progress in the game and eases you into more complex gameplay and strategies. It allows players to enjoy playing the game without making PvP the only way to grind out cards.Not to mention, Konami is extremely generous with handing out currency to buy card packs in the game. There's usually a new event every week, and if you put in some time, you can get quite a bit of currency with a relatively low investment of time. Since playing the game when it first came out a year ago, I've only spent around $15 on the game, and I have a few fun decks that I use competitively. I also have a lot of fun making creative decks and messing around in casual, unranked games too.As you play the game more and become competitive, you'll find that ranked play is very rewarding. The game has new seasons every month, and each season resets your rewards list. One thing that Duel Links does great is rewarding you for playing competitively. I'll pick on Hearthstone again. In Hearthstone, you log in, do your daily quests, and that's pretty much it. You don't really have more incentive in playing any more games for the day. In Duel Links, there are no daily caps in what you can earn from ranked play. Theoretically, if you spend your entire day playing ranked and winning, you can amass a lot of rewards, while still being able to play more to earn more. That is something I appreciate. Some days, I just feel like playing a ranked game or two to take a break from PvE, and some days I go full HAM and spend hours playing ranked. I feel well rewarded in both cases.In regards to the actual PC version of the game, it really is just a port of the mobile version. However, there are some real benefits and convenience in playing it on PC. These include: Not killing/burning my phone (battery) by playing this game for a long period of time. Playing the game with a much stronger processor (much smoother gameplay and FPS). A keyboard, which facilitates building decks.A wider screen that shows your battle log and card info beside your main play screen.This game is very polished. For those who grew up watching the anime on TV, you'll appreciate the fact that Konami managed to get all the old voice actors and actresses to voice their old roles. Konami's keeping an eye on the power creep in the game. I'm sure it will grow in the future, but with the amount of effort that Konami is demonstrating now in curating which cards are added to the game, I have confidence that Konami can keep this game from spiralling into the nonsense that plagues the modern TCG.I would recommend it to Yu-Gi-Oh TCG fans of all ages, people from MTG and Hearthstone to try something new, people who just want a nostalgia trip back to their childhood, and people who have never heard of Yu-Gi-Oh too! It really is a fun time building and playing decks, and that's the dream of any collectible card game enthusiast.;16 November, 2017;

Shadows of Doubt;Aggression;NOT INFORMED;900 people found this review helpful57 people found this review funny; Recommended 38.0 hrs on record;"I enter a nearby canteen, having just thrown synth pork into the face of a businesswoman, completing a humiliation job I was hired for. I browse the job listings by the phone when my enforcer scanner comes alive with report of a murder. I look at the map and it is in a nearby apartment building, so I sprint to the address listed. As the elevator slows to the floor of the murder, I see the security door is shut. I climb into a nearby vent, exit in a neighbor’s apartment, leave, run to the security panel, pick the lock, turn off the cameras so I would not be seen, and make a dash for the murder scene, opening the apartment with a key found under the door mat. A short brown-haired man is sitting on the couch, next to a toy car. I whip out my handcuffs and arrest him. I proceed to the bedroom, finding a body crumpled over itself. There is an 8mm cartridge next to the body, and another toy car. I take the victim's prints and analyze the body. she was killed by a handgun. I run to the handcuffed man and search him. he has an 8mm handgun. Got him!I hear the security door raising, so it is time to leave. I run out of the apartment, just as enforcers rush through the security door with weapons drawn. I head to the neighbor's house that I had just sneaked through and knock on the door. They answer. I ask if he had seen anything strange recently, to which he provided that a short brown-haired man was seen around the apartment at the time of the murder and they were clearly angry. Got him!The enforcers are still around, so I head up the stairs, looking for the building's management office. I find it on the 7th floor. I pick the office’s lock and close the door behind me. I open the surveillance footage, and navigate to the cameras outside the victim's apartment. Only the victim and the short brown-haired man were on camera. Nobody else comes or goes from the apartment. Got him!I head back down to the apartment. As the enforcers finish clearing the murder scene, they exit and leave a guard out front. I slink into the apartment, shut the door, and head back to the bedroom, then rifling through the documents in the wardrobe. It seems the short brown-haired man is the victim's spouse. It is always the spouse. got him!I head back to the short, brown-haired man and grab his prints, then scan the bedroom for prints. There are tons of hits for the victim and the short brown-haired man. However, the toy car next to the victim has prints that do not belong to victim or her spouse... That is suspicious. might be worth looking into.Digging into the victim and spouse's email histories, they both seem happy together. Maybe it is not this guy. Scanning the rest of the apartment, all finger and foot prints match the victim and spouse. that small toy car is the only exception. I should try to find some other leads. I place a tracker on the spouse, then head to the victim's workplace.Once there, I notice a picture board behind the counter showing the victim and her co-workers. I pin the co-workers' profiles onto my murder board before seeing a note nearby. ""The password to the office is 1234"". classic. I punch the code into the door, turn off the cameras, and open the filing cabinet. The worker files have fingerprint data, so I grab them for all the co-workers. No matches to the toy car.By this point, the victim's spouse has been released, so I use the tracker to find them. I ask for their name, which they provide, and if they saw anything suspicious. They give me the same spiel about a short brown-haired person in the apartment. Odd that he would provide that statement, given it is a match for himself. The evidence all points to the spouse, but his cooperation and that darn toy car are dissolving my confidence.With no additional leads, I start investigating the victim's neighbors. I start in the lobby, scanning the mailboxes around the victim's floors looking for fingerprints. no matches to the toy car. I scan the doors of the neighbors from 3 floors down from the victim to three floors up. no matches. Maybe it was one of the building's staff! I break back into the management office and review the worker files. no matches. What is going on here?!Then it happened… Another murder is reported on the scanner, this time on the other side of town. I race to the scene, trying to beat the enforcers again. The security door is shut like usual, but there are no nearby vents. The enforcers run up behind me, so I stand aside, letting them clear the scene. I knock on a neighbor's apartment and a small woman answers the door. I get their name and fingerprints, then ask if they saw anything suspicious. ""A short brown-haired person left at 0645."" The same killer as the first victim? I wait for the enforcers to leave and sneak inside the victim’s apartment. I analyze the victim. killed by an 8mm handgun. There are six 8mm cartridges nearby and... another toy car. I scan the car for prints, and they match the prints from the first victim's toy car. The killer is taunting me! I run through the apartment looking for any info. The victim lives alone, works at a nearby pharmacy, and does not have any apparent enemies.I sneak back out of the apartment, past the guard, and start searching for the management office. Finding it, I open the filing cabinet and look at the worker files. still no print matches. I jump on the cruncher, and look through all the individuals that were on the victim's floor, trying to find a short brown-haired man, when it happens... At 0645, a short brown-haired man was seen going down the stairs from the victim's floor. I pin their profile to the murder board, but I have no name, address, place of work, or anything I could use to find them. I head back downstairs, deciding to show the picture to the neighbor. Maybe she could confirm if this was the man she saw.The neighbor answers the door again, and I show her a picture of my lead. ""Oh, I work with him! His name is <REDACTED>. I saw him leave the victim's apartment at 0645."" We have a solid lead now. I run down the stairs and out of the building, entering a nearby phone booth. I open the city directory, find his address, and head to it.I arrive at their front door and scan for prints. No matches to the suspect. I knock on the door and a small blonde woman answers. I ask for her name, which she provides, and her fingerprints, which she refuses. I ask if I can show her a picture of the suspect, but she is not interested in identifying anyone. She is not being cooperative, but what can I do... That is when I see him. A short brown-haired man matching the surveillance footage walks by an open doorway behind the woman. I make a split-second decision to stop this here and now.I whip out my truncheon, knock out the woman in front of me, enter the apartment, and shut the door. The short brown-haired man turns the corner, drawn to the commotion. The truncheon goes back to work and he goes down too, but not before he got some punches of his own in, leaving a bruise on me. I search him. he has 8mm ammo. Got him! I take his fingerprints. they are a match to the toy cars. Got him! I handcuff the man and begin searching for the murder weapon.I search through the home finding work info, sales receipts, birth certificates, wallets, but no weapon. Nothing in the kitchen. Nothing in the bedroom. Bathroom never has anything, although I did find some Paxadol for my bruise. I dig through the office, nothing. I dig through the living room, nothing. Finally, I spot it. There is a drawer on the hi-fi gramophone that I didn't notice! In the drawer there was a self-help book. Underneath the book was a silenced 8mm Lazarus 5. I scan the handgun for prints and they, once again, match the suspect.Having all the evidence I needed, I head for city hall. After validation of the info, they confirm everything I provided was correct! Case closed! I collect my payment and head back to the burger joint for a well-earned coffee and cheeseburger.";17 May, 2023;

As I opened their profile, only 4% of their information were on it, not much.I knew they had grey eyes, name starts with a Z, and their partner was a Clinic Manager. Turns out I got lucky on that one because there is only 4 Clinics in the city, and only 1 manager per clinic, so I did that leg work and went to all clinics around town to grab the profile of all of their manager.On my way to visit the first manager I got a new murder case so I make a small detour by the City Hall to get the case files, I thought I'd tackle this after my other case so I don't read anything and go straight to resume my first case.As I arrive on the floor of the first Clinic Manager, I am surprised by some Crime Scene Tape on one of the door, turns out the victim of the murder case was the neighbour of my Clinic Manager, I thought that was a happy coincidence and went on to continue my first case.No luck though, even though I checked their work hours and made sure I'd go in during that time, I didn't pay attention to the fact that we were Sunday so they were home. Since the murder case was right across the hallway, I went back to tackle that one in the meantime.That murder case was a classic, gun shot wound, and not many clues as to who could have done this. One small detail though, in the corner of the room, between the desk and the bed, a crumbled paper on the floor which said ""Let's Play"", which sounded very Serial Killer to me, so I checked the fingerprint on it and got a direct match on a name. I thought that was somebody I already checked on a previous case and found it funny, but as I digged deeper, turns out it was the name of the Clinic Manager who lives across !Pretty determined, I go back inside the home of that Clinic Manager and sneak in to get all the info I could.I grab the ID of their partner who happens to have grey eyes and a name that starts with a Z, this cannot be a coincidence. On the way I also get a receipt on some ammo purchased by the Clinic Manager who happen to be the type of ammo who killed our murder victim.The two lovebirds were the two different suspects on two different cases, and everything was procedurally generated.Both cases: SolvedMind: BlownThis game is a pure gem, can't wait to see what's next.";30 April, 2023;

A man had been shot to death in the street. There was no useful surveillance, no fingerprints on anything, not even the shell casings. Whoever did this was a pro. I looked up the victim's government records, investigated their home and everyone they knew. Nothing. The day was almost over and I knew that by morning the killer would strike again. At a loss, I returned to the crime scene to see if there was anything I had missed. I scoured over the pavement in desperation, looking at used napkins and empty cans for any sign of a clue. Then I found it. A crumpled piece of paper in the gutter, with an anagram of the killer's name, challenging me to find them. I read the letters and a revelation hit me like a truck: I already know the killer. Before this case, I had taken a small job to pass the time. A minor surveillance gig, I was supposed to take a photo of some poor bastard I was being paid to stalk. I had never completed it, my investigation was put on pause when a sudden murder stole my attention. The name of the man who issued that job I never finished was very peculiar and memorable, full of apostrophes and dashes. The anagram could only possibly spell one name. His rare, weird name. It HAD to be him. I grabbed his government file as soon as possible and raced to his apartment, I knocked frantically at the door and once someone was ready to answer it, flung myself down the hallway and drop-kicked the door as hard as I could, blasting it open and knocking the woman behind it unconscious. She was the wife of the suspect. He wasn't even home. I handcuffed her as I ripped the apartment apart, vandalizing everything I could get my hands on. I tore through their computer while on painkillers before getting drunk in the living room and throwing a bottle of wine directly into the drywall for no reason. I took a shower and then forgot to dry myself, slipping in the kitchen and hitting my head on the ground while attempting to get a piece of meat to throw in the face of the woman I had kidnapped in my pursuit of justice. Throughout all of this I had found no useful information and was getting desperate. I even tried throwing a boiling tea kettle into the face of that woman before questioning her to see if it would make her more cooperative. It didn't. I began to wonder if it was possible to have two people with the same weird name. Surely not? I checked the city directory and there were two people with the same name. I had broken into the wrong house and spent about 20 minutes beating the innocent wife of an innocent man and breaking things. In the end, I'd do it all again for the sake of justice. I eventually reported the right person and my social credit score went up, which means I did nothing wrong. You can't judge me.; 10 May Earl;

So, on that basis, yes, I recommend it.However, if you're here for a classic Tycoon game, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, a few hours of scratching the surface will reveal that there is very little underneath, it lacks dynamism and simulation in most aspects and the longevity suffers as a result.It is possible to set up a successful business and never have to touch it again, while watching the money roll in. As a critique of capitalism, it works really well, as once you get beyond a certain size there is nothing to do but waste your money on trinkets and status symbols.Some fundamentals of retail simulation are missing:There is no modelling of staff needs - while the player needs food, rest, and happiness, staff are automata, and a full-time staff member will work 50 solid hours in a row without complaint.While staff have a preference for how many weekly hours they are scheduled, this only serves to turn scheduling into a sliding box puzzle, and as the game doesn't keep track of how many hours someone has worked in a given period, you can shuffle the board to keep them happy without penalty.Once you've set up a schedule that works, no matter how unrealistic, it stays working.And no, having random absences doesn't address this.There is no simulation of customer behaviour, the maximum number of customers per hour is the result of a formula, and this formula does a poor job of modelling the realities of the store.This can be demonstrated by comparing the number of customers per hour your business serves when you're in the store with when you're not.The game doesn't keep track of how many customers are in the store, nor how long an order takes to fulfil, and if you walk in and out of the store all your customers for that hour will disappear and take their revenue for that hour with them.Spoiler: Your business does far better when you're not there, which kills the fun and challenge of laying out your store to maximise throughput.Finally, competitors appear to be static. Rival businesses will open and close, but this seems like randomness for randomness' sake, to alter demand for products, rather than as a reaction to anything the player has done.Their businesses don't appear to have their own revenue, staffing, or stock requirements. Maybe they are modelled under the hood, but given how few of the game's mechanics are systems-driven, I doubt it.Thankfully, it's just launched in Early Access so there's plenty of time to improve it, and the roadmap addresses a few (but not all) of the issues I have.The developer seems really open to suggestions and keen to make it the best they can, and I truly hope they succeed.;14 March, 2023;

Starting off is fun, it's an incredibly tedious process of trying to stay afloat and build your little empire. However that makes it fun. I started off with a wine & cigar store, progressed to a gift shop, built a massive law firm (* huge waste of time don't do it *), before finally blowing a million hard earned dollars through careful stock flips on a ""five cups"" coffee shop which is nothing more than a tax write off I can not make a profit nor keep employees. The problem I have is that you're going to hit a part in the game where there's really nothing left to pursue. That bad business I blew a million dollars on? I can't sell it. I didn't even know it was a failing business, all this game will let you do is make a proposition to the business owner and he says yes or no. You don't even get a due dilligence packet showing you the finances of the business and whether its going to be a good buy or not. The stock market is pretty limited. You're enclosed to two banks. Jensen capital (* a shady bank *), and a bigger bank deep in the city. Each bank has 3 stock investments you can buy. That's it. Very slow moving. The more money you pump into a fund the more volatile your gains / losses will be, but it's pretty fatiguing watching that. Granted, that's not the point of this game - it's to build a business empire to gain wealth, not work the stock market. But, freedom should be in the player in how they want to play this.

Big Ambitions;Deathstar;657 products in account;208 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 20.4 hrs on record;Big Ambitions is a contender for the most aptly named game out there. This surprise title is brimming with potential and incredibly addictive gameplay right from the start. But can it hold your attention while you work and/or gamble your way to becoming the next big business magnate?The game starts quite realistically. You have no money, no car and no place to stay, which is a pretty awful thing when you live in New York City. Luckily, your rich uncle steps up to act as your mentor, tells you to grab a small business loan and to rent a place for yourself to live in as well as a property to open a tiny gift shop in. Right from the get-go, you can't help but be impressed by what the game is promising to be. You control your own character at all times, but can manage deliveries, staff and other things via your phone. You outfit your own store yourself, by purchasing individual furniture pieces, loading them into your car, driving down to the shop and then grabbing them one by one to place them. One look at the map shows you that nearly every building in the game is purchaseable and can act as either a home, a warehouse or a place to run a business in. This gets you hooked, makes you want to put in the effort to eventually own most of the city. Maybe you could control the entire liquor market and create artificial shortages to manipulate the demand... The possibilities seem endless, especially once your uncle tells you that demand for certain products fluctuates and is also different for each neighbourhood.This is the part of the review where I finally tell you why it is marked as a negative one. The phenomenal early game experience simply does not last. After opening a couple of businesses, you quickly realise that you've already hit the end game. There is very little difference between running a tiny corner shop versus a gigantic jewelry emporium in the heart of the city, with the exception being that larger stores are a pain to furnish. It feels great to outfit your starter shop yourself, grabbing individual shelves from the back of your car and placing them with care, but having to do the same for a large clothes store that needs you to place over 40 clothes racks to satisfy customer capacity gets dull very fast. There are no options to automate the more tedious aspects of the game later on, which puts a dampener on the experience. It would have been great to be able to save a template for your stores that you can later apply to others you open, to save you some manual labour. Isn't being rich all about just throwing money at stuff so you don't have to do anything? Let me pay some muscle to get my store ready for me, thank you.Even if you enjoy manually furnishing your businesses, you'll likely never even set foot back in them once they're up and running. Hiring and training staff is done through menus, as is assigning them to their work schedules. Once that's done, you automate the supply line using a warehouse and your HQ workers, the purchase and logistics agents. Again, you unfortunately cannot just tell the people you pay to handle your logistics to actually handle your logistics autonomously. You will need to set exact purchase limits and frequencies, as well as how much stock your stores should receive. Optimising this is a matter of watching the balance for a few days, then adjusting, then leaving it forever (or until you open another business that uses the same goods). It would have been nice to have an option to let some skilled managers handle this aspect as well once you're so rich that you really can't be bothered anymore.The need for manual micro management on your part makes buying out other businesses more of a tedium. They do come pre-furnished, but often need a few extra pieces that you will have to lug on over. Then, you will need to integrate your new acquisition into your supply chain by adjusting the imports and stock levels and assigning HQ agents to it. Tedious!Now, you would think that with such a heavy focus on micro management, there would be lots of things to actually manage. Tons of different products, maybe from different suppliers and/or countries. Rare artisan products with huge individual profit magins versus mass produced garbage that sells really well. Unfortunately, not really. Again, in the early game you are almost delusional at the prospect of running many different kinds of shops, but ultimately, there is only a handful of business types available. These are split into shops and offices. Offices are totally hands-off once you assign employees and maybe buy some marketing for them, they'll just start generating passive income. Shops are slightly more involved in that they need a supply chain, but you only ever have to worry about a handful of products. Gift shops for instance can only sell three types of goods: Cheap gifts, expensive gifts and soda cans. Meh. I would have liked more variety maybe. Same with the building interiors, these are the same for all properties and only vary by size and type of business. Some unique designs would have been awesome.I believe the game is struggling with its own identity. It wants to be a business sim, but it has a bunch of life sim aspects in it that slow it down. But neither aspect is 100% fleshed out, so ultimately, they both fall just short of being great. This game is almost amazing. It's so unique and it conjurs up images of old-school business tycoons but it just doesn't reach that level of complexity. Once you have a comfortable enough passive income (which is not hard to achieve), you lack motivation to move on. From that point, it's closer to an AFK clicker game than a business sim, open another few stores to watch that number go up, done. Reaching the zenith of New York high society should feel like a rush, instead it is a sad realization that you've exhausted what fun you had in the game. Maybe that's a hidden message to us, the audience, that money cannot buy happiness?I will say that the game is still in Early Access, so additional business types and goods can easily be added, as well as features such as auto-furnish or auto-balancing supply chains. However, I'm not sure how the actual end game can be improved with just more content.;8 April, 2023;

In Sims, the life of the business owner takes the central stage, but the business mechanics are lacking. The economic systems that run Capitalism Lab are unmatched, but the human element is nearly if not completely absent.Big Ambitions manages to create a good business simulator, while not forgetting the persons running the whole thing.

Punch Club;TheFencer;NOT INFORMED;198 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 9.7 hrs on record;This game starts off promisingly. It has all the right elements needed to make a good management game--and I love management games! But the thing is, unlike most management games, Fight Club doesn't want me to succeed. It wants me to fail. At its simplest definition, the goal here is to improve your stats (and skills) to win matches. However, your stats degrade at great amounts everyday. So the challenge here is to train and train to increase your stats more than they decrease. The problem is they decrease A LOT, and the game puts forward ridiculous barriers to seemingly make sure that even at your best, your stats increase at the slowest pace possible (and at your worst, they actually decrease). Just to illustrate:- The job that pays the most pays $50 per round and the other job closer to your house pays $30, but the most efficient food costs $20 and fills up less than half of your food meter.- Having a sparring match with your trainer to get skill points costs $20.- The gym costs $10 per entry- If you earn more than $250, you get robbed, because this game does not want you to ever accumulate money.- You can only store 7 pieces of each food item, so it doesn't want you to accumulate food either.- All of these are located in different areas which takes time to get to, and the more you waste the hours of your day walking around, the more your stats decrease.This results in a lot of grinding and managing your time and money PERFECTLY just to make sure your stats don't decrease more than they increase. And that's fine. I'm fine with grinding, and management games are called that because it's all about managing your resources efficiently. My problem with this in this game is that it gets disheartening. It wants you to regress as hard as it can. It wants you to save $250 to get that gym equipment only to be robbed on the way to the store. It wants you to prepare for your match and reach 15 agility only to reach the next day and be back at 14. It wants you to meticulously plan your day, only to be dragged into an event you didn't expect and get beaten by a much harder opponent and lose bars you've worked hard to fill. This is that rare management game that wants to rob you of that feeling of progression.I stuck through this game because I thought it would get better once you get stronger. It didn't. The stats just get harder to train and easier to lose. I eventually gave up near the end thinking that I've wasted my time.;11 September, 2016;

You can win a fight without taking a single blow and knocking your opponent in the first round, but you can also lose without hitting the enemy once because ""RNGesus"" is spitting on you. It is nice you can speed up the combat to x4 speed because when farming achievements or replaying the game it gets boring to watch the passive fights. Since you cannot control anything during the fight itself, the only thing to do for you is swapping the skills between rounds if needed or getting the experience which skills to get next to beat the opponent you lost against.The game is quite challanging because of ""stat decay"", that means your fighting abilities dwell over time, so you have to carefully plan when to train and when to work for cash to be able to feed yourself. If you play the game on ""Hard"", it gonna definetely take some time to beat it especially if its your first run. Graphic & Interface : 6/10 Retro style graphic absolutely fit the game and there are some nice details here and there to look for. The small details greatly increase the immersion and make the game more fun (for example take a look at who is standing outside Apu's shop, or the pictures hanging in some houses, etc.). The interface is simple and offers not many functions, maybe lacking a bit in flexibility. It would be nice to set-up how many hours you want to train on a bench or to what exhaustion level you want to work. The game is based around decisions made for your character, but the interface does not provide all needed tools for perfection. Progress & Mini-Games : 6/10 The progress depends heavily on the difficulty you picked. On the hardest difficulty the progress becomes quite grindy, since you have to ""work, eat, sleep, repeat"" a lot. Then you lock yourself for few days in the gym training to be able to take 1-2 fights and you are out of cash again, so the cycle starts again.On the middle difficulty the progress is much quicker, so it is possible to finish the game in few hours achieving the hidden 100 days achievement. Sadly, on certain phases of the game it does not let you progress quick enough by holding back the fights telling you the opponent gonna be ""read in few days"". It slows you down unnessesary, but gives you some more time for training.There are no activities to be considered mini-games in Punch Club, so this point is not taken into rating. Audio & Immersion : 7/10 The music and audio in generel absolutely fit the style of the game. Retro sounds to retro graphics make you feel like playing this old coin machines that were standing in clubs in the 90s. The game has nice details for immersion, some side effects like flashing graphics and squicky sounds that increase the immersion effect at the right spots in the game. Side-Notes This game is single player only.This game contains steam achievements.This game offers replayability for further 2-3 runs. You can either try the other side of the story or different skill builds.This game offers some play time for its price - it took me 30 hours to finish the game twice on both story sides including one hardcore run and getting most achievements. Summary Punch Club is so far the best fighting manager in retro look. The game has great feeling and immersion, especially if you loved oldschool Kung-Fu or fighting movies and has tons of references to movies and characters somehow connected to fighting. It offers nice challenge, replayability value and impactful story decisions.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.

It's rough around the edges and is best purchased on sale or from a bundle.Pros:+Art style is sweet+Packed with references+Some level of interesting story progression and choices to makeCons:-Grinding for food and stats-Bugs (I've encountered around nine or ten so far)-Lack of information for certain thingsLet me start off by saying that the art style, the music, and the references all are very nice and support lasting interest in this game. There's been a couple times where I've chuckled and even more where I've gotten into the music or been impressed by something that's been drawn.The story progression is rough around the edges but over-all has some choices to be made and should capture some level of interest no matter what.I am currently around 7.5 hours into the game, and up to about the 6.5 hour mark, I was really enjoying it. I was lucky enough to get over the early-on robbery hurdle that everybody else has been having trouble with, but now that I've gotten to this point, I can't progress any more without investing more time than it's worth.The biggest flaw that I have seen bringing this game down is the stat loss system. In the beginning of the game it's a minimal impact mechanic to extend the length of the game and make sure you have more to balance, but by halfway through it will leave you grinding like crazy just to hold your stats where they are. I spend all day everyday training currently, and my stats stay around the same area meaning that I cannot handle any larger fights and progress in the game.With this, I will sometimes encounter bugs when I'm trying to travel to buy more energy drinks that require a game restart, or being told to visit the Don on three seperate occasions by people, and every time having him act like he's never met me. Who knows, maybe he has amnesia.The last of the issues I encountered, and so far probably the least impactful is the lack of information. At the beginning it was very difficult to get started because besides the small training manual you're given, there is very little information on where to start, meaning you'll probably end up eating at least a few rotten burgers from the trash outside the bar.Over-all, I would rate this game a 6.5/10, given that it has a lot of potential, but just falls short due to the grind-essential nature of the training mechanic. I don't know if I will be playing this game again any time soon, but it was fun while it lasted, just up to where I've left off.Thanks for reading.;19 October, 2016;

I loved all the TV and movie references sprinkled around the world (Fight Club, Rocky, Snatch, TMNT, Pulp Fiction, etc, etc.) I just felt ultimately everything gets way too repetitive. The training and working you have to be in a constant balancing act doing days and days and days of keeping stats and money in check while making sure you have enough food to be able to not starve. Just seems like way too much time doing this stuff instead of getting to fight. The fighting feels pretty shallow too, overall. Didn't thrill me at all. Also, no variety in music. After a couple hours I had to just mute the music and play my own so I didn't blow my brains out.;4 June, 2016;

Now is the time to clear this from backlog! Punch Club 2 released a week ago, a perfect time to check out the original, I thought. Turns out yes it is! The title still holds up with its art and gameplay! This game has been offered many times through bundles, so many people own it already. If you don't own it yet, it's about €2,50 during sales. Weirdly enough not now with the launch of the new installation. Punch Club In this game you're a beginning fighter who wants revenge for his father. You can join fighting leagues, street fights, and ascend the ranks in all of them. Meanwhile you have to train hard, and keeping up with your energy and calories. Which means you have to work for money, which takes valuable time, and not training decreases your fitness. The game is rather forgiving, you can't die. If you lose, it mostly means it will take more time. If you run out of food and money you can always eat that rotten hamburger from the trash, you'll be fine! And the game is fair in length. It keeps the story going with a nice pace. Winning fights give talent points, which you can put into three paths. Strength, Agility and Stamina. These are also the stats you're training to increase. Before fights you can assign skills, and you see the skills your opponent uses. So you can somewhat counter your opponents, which means in reality omit some skills they are countering, for example versus block breakers omitting blocks. Conclusion A great game! It's a perfect game to spend 15-20 hours with. Full with references, that I won't spoil. If you were part of those eras, you will definitely enjoy this. If you're a millennial or younger, I'm not sure if this is very funny. Parts that I liked slightly less were working jobs, there is a moment the protagonist returned from abroad, and there were no jobs available except for the two basic ones. It felt like a bug. Speaking of bugs, one time my house disappeared. Turns out I hadn't triggered an event and was able to spawn it afterwards, but still this should have been patched. The title rolls neatly from the tongue, however you're not in a club at all. Because of the title I had a different expectation of the game. And lastly it's very unclear how effective skills are. The game does give a hitpercentage of skills, but it would be far more useful to see damage per energy. I played this to see if part 2 would be for me, now I know it is. Not right now, my backlog is huge :)84/100More reviews at Omnivore Gamer, games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers).;27 July, 2023;

It's just not clearly indicated to the player in a fair manner.Yes I love this game and put a whole load of time into it but many people will go in with the idea it's a simple resource-management game with extra interactions tacked on. It simply isn't however, it's a pure to the genre min-max game in which you're to know what to do and when to do it off the bat - there's no middle-ground sadly. I made a huge error first time playing this game and luckily for both myself and the dev's I had the time and willingness to spend to restart and do the whole game a-fresh. Not everyone is willing enough to do this, and I don't disrespect that.Either way, I came to love this game and for it a love for Lazy Bear Games as a developer - however with all caveats listed yes I give this game a thumbs-up and recommend it along with Lazy Bear Games as Dev's but I am totally empathetic to anyone that dislikes this game and so it feels only fair to state this game is likely to have a fair but somewhat niche audience that will truly love it for what it is.;28 January, 2023;
Punch Club;MonkeyShogun;340 products in account;69 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 12.9 hrs on record;"Do not be fooled by the store page. this game is not a fun little resource-management game but a hardcore min-max experience. If you do not plan out your days like Batman plans out the twelve different ways he's going to disable the first jaywalker he sees next month, you will fail.I feel like there's a fun game in here somewhere, but it is buried under multiple layers of mild annoyances that all add up to the end result of an incredibly infuriating experience. Stat Decay: Yeah, it's annoying as hell. The game is balanced around this mechanic dogging your every step throughout any given playthrough, and working around it never feels fun. it feels like you're barely keeping your head above water even if you spend an entire day just training, to say nothing of simultaneously having to take time to work, get paid, feed yourself and keep your energy up, none of which halt the decay.Story: The first annoyance is that the entire thing is basically one endless stream of 80s American pop culture references awkwardly crammed together into a single, nigh-incomprehensible package. I love it when stories don't take themselves too seriously and are willing to have fun, but Far Cry: Blood Dragon executed this particular theme astronomically better. Maybe this stuff is funnier to Russian players and got lost in translation. I couldn't tell you.The second annoyance is that the game features multiple routes for you to take, but there is no way to skip or fast-forward interactions you've already seen on subsequent playthroughs. The game also gives you very little agency in which story routes to activate. it will frequently wrest control from you and force you into side stories you may or may not be interested in, and will occasionally even throw you into a fight with no warning whatsoever, often right after you just finished another fight and are weakened from stat loss.This is particularly noticeable in regards to ""The Dark Fist"" storyline, which was previously a DLC (and therefore optional) but is now baked into the base game and forced upon you with no choice. ANY playthrough of the game now will REQUIRE you to dedicate a significant portion of your time to difficult battles from this DLC. These DLC interactions are automatically triggered whenever you go home, which is the only place you can efficiently recover energy and heal after a fight.Everything Else: You've essentially got three style to choose from when building your fighter, and while they are all viable they aren't particularly well balanced. A bear build is fun but risky, and a pain to train for. a turtle build is interesting but slow to start (go figure). and a tiger build has high accuracy and dodge, plus several ways to make enemies hurt themselves. I think you can see the issue there.I feel bad for writing this horrendous wall of text and just criticizing the game so harshly, but as much as I want to be able to enjoy this silly 80s pop-culture boxing management game, it does everything within its power to annoy the ???? out of me and stop me from enjoying it. I sincerely hope the upcoming sequel respects the player a bit more and spends more time getting out of the way and letting people enjoy it.";25 February, 2023;

Legion TD 2 - Multiplayer Tower Defense;in;NOT INFORMED;47 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 2,339.1 hrs on record;Awesome multiplayer auto-battler, with a thriving, generally nice community, and ongoing development! Stop waves of enemies! In Legion TD 2 (LTD) you have to stop enemies that spawn in waves on your 'lane'. The enemies give a bounty for each kill, and with that gold you can buy new fighters in between the waves. The game gives a recommended value of your fighters for each wave consisting of the total possible value that comes spawning. Depending on the type of units you have put on your lane with all their synergies and positioning, this value can be either too high or too low. For instance, a collection of only tanks (units that soak damage well, but don't deal much themselves) will probably not clear a wave. The units that you 'leak' will attack your king! But not before your teammate's fighters that survived his wave have a chance to attack your leakage. The bounty now is shared between the both of you, and your opposing team also gets a cut! Units have one of four types of attacks and one of five types of defense. The types have bonuses and penalties towards each other, as seen on the ingame diagram, and these values aren't linear. A magic damage dealer will struggle against arcane armour, but will melt through nature armour!Mythium and workers There is a second resource, called mythium. Mythium is used to hire mercenaries that will join the next wave of the opponent! Hiring mercenaries raises your income that you receive after a wave is finished. The mercenaries are dependant on the amount of mythium you spend how powerful they are. You can also choose more powerful units at a reduced income. And in this part is where most battles are fought. In recognising your opponents build to choose a wave to enhance. And of course synchronising your sends with teammate, however his opponent might be strong on that wave, so that may not be the best tactic. Another tactic is just to go for the best possible income, and deal with any opposition by shear value. You start with two workers that gather 1 mythium every ten seconds. New workers can be bought for gold. Your game is a balance between your workers and your fighters. It may be worth it to go a bit too lean on your fighters, and ahead with your workers! Purposely leaking one or two units gives you more juicy mythium, and if you are ahead on worker count, you will gain an advantage! The Legions & Mastermind The fighters belong to a Legion of fighters. There are Antelean, Divine, Element, Forsaken, Grove Mech, Noomad and Shrine, each with six tiers of fighters. Originally in the predecessors of this game you chose one Legion and battled with those. But this got a bit boring, so now you play with selected group of fighters from a random selection of all Legions. This makes for much more variety in the games, and less repetition. You can still play as a Legion in non-ranked modes. The history of LTDLTD was originally a custom map in Warcraft 3. I personally only knew and played the version of Starcraft 2: Squadron TD. I remember that I returned at some point to that game, and it was significantly different, with more 'Squadrons' and at some point a leaderboard. Very fond memories there, and I wish that map-layout gets implemented in this game, because I loved the shared buildingzone! Game modesRanked - 2v2 games for an ELO rating. You can queue with a partner. Classic - 4v4 mayhem! There are more selections possible of fighters, such as the fully random 'hybrid'! Can be queued up to eight people! Custom game - games can have adjusted rules, such as high income Campaign - very challenging bosses which cheat! Vs AI - of different ladder rankings Weekly challenge - very hard puzzles to defeat a wave with selected fighters. The solution with the least gold value wins! Furthermore there is an extensive tutorial, you can browse top games of the best players, and can test builds in a sandbox. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2650502603My experience When I saw this game arrive on early access four years ago, I immediately bought it, which is rare for me. I have such good memories of STD, playing so many games without even a ladder! But nowadays I'm not really looking for an endless game, and not just ladder for ladder's sake. So the game shifted to my backlog. Now that the game is fully released since two months, I've got a clear goal in getting all achievements! The biggest part is getting 100 wins in one season in both ranked and classic! I'm practically done with the ranked one, and felt it was time to review this. The ladder is quite special. My first games weren't very good, so I got to bronze ELO (below 1200). Now I got to around 1600-1700, maybe I will try for Diamond 1800. For a physically handicapped player I'm satisfied, because some waves I don't have enough time to do the things I'd like to do. The players are generally kind. Every now and then you encounter someone who rages when you don't execute his plan. You are obviously the reason he isn't on top of the ladder, hehe! This game is a true gem! With a dedicated development! Do I have anything bad to say? Yes I don't understand why creating a guild is behind a paywall. They say only cosmetic items are available for money,;30 November, 2021;

We Happy Few;Bella;NOT INFORMED;232 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Recommended 47.6 hrs on record;"As much as I loved the game in the beginning, just as much I hated it in the end. I really wanted to like it, I was so excited, I spent so much time playing it, but in the end, I'm disappointed and the best would be a mixed review. Things I liked about the game:- The world, the main story and the dystopia they created, I loved them all. All of these are very interesting, there are some very cool ideas and I enjoyed the weirdness of it. - I liked exploring, but I didn't know what to do with 200+ crafting parts when I didn't even need them. It felt pointless to loot everything.- I was alright with the survival elements, even though they didn't add much to the gameplay to me.- There are some loveable and interesting side characters. As for the main characters, I only liked and cared about the first one.- There are some nice twists in the plot.- It can be funny and creepy at the same time. - Nice references.- Act 1. I liked almost everything about it, I liked the character, his personal story, the twist. I played this part the most (around 25 hours), because I wanted to finish as many side quests as I could. - All 3 DLCs. Things I could forgive to the game:- Graphics: I absolutely love the cartoonish art style of the game, yet I don't think it's polished enough. It just doesn't look very nice.- Repetitive soundtrack.- Glitches that weren't game breaking, like NPCs stuck in walls or floating in the air.- Not enough assets. I like when there are different areas in a game and you can tell exactly where things are after you explored everything, but here, I never knew where I had to go, simply because everything looks the same: the buildings, roads, signs, even the people are the same. (Fun fact: the game even jokes about it). There are maybe 4 different people in the districts wearing 2 type of clothes. The policemen look all the same, except that I found like 2 of them in red suit and 1 in white suit. It's quite funny and also sad when you walk down the road minding your business and 5 of the same old ladies walk by.- Crafting felt like a useless and unnecessary addition. The game just simply didn't need it. - It's not creepy enough. Last time I checked ""horror"" was in the game tags, but the whole intro is creepier than everything else in the game. - The open world felt pointless in the end. Things I couldn't forgive to the game:- Bad gameplay system. I think they couldn't agree on what kind of gameplay they wanted to add, so it's a mish-mash of different elements. It has stealth elements, yet it's not stealthy enough. You can only hide in 1 type of bush, when there are several other bushes with the same size. The combat is wonky and weird. - Bad AI. It's connected to the bad stealth system. It's one thing that they forget you as soon as you hide for 3 seconds and then you can walk right to them to talk, but there was a quest in a large room where I decided to be stealthy. I was so stealthy that I walked right in front of their noses and they didn't notice me. One similar thing that the game warns you about joy doctors, who can notice you very easily, at least that's what they said. They could notice me so easily, that I was standing 2 steps behind one of them in a quest and he had no idea I was even there. - Nothing really matters. The game warns you about using too much Joy, and guess what, I barely even used Joy, because it wasn't necessary. The only time my character was overdosed in the whole game was the time when I reloaded the game after finishing it to overdose him for an achievement... and nothing happened. Using or not using Joy has no consequencses. It doesn't matter if you spare the enemies or rob them or kill them. Nothing changes. Nothing matters. - Plotholes. I love the idea of the story, but it's just full of unanswered questions, and sometimes very important story elements are hidden in random papers somewhere that you might miss. I like exploring, but the world actually changes between acts and that makes exploring annoying. (I mean it's the same map with different layout). I think that important answers shouldn't be missable. - Act 2-3 are horrible. I love act 1, I also like the 3 DLCs, but I simply hated everything about act 2-3. The whole act 2 is a fetch quest. They are short, rushed, boring - even though they tried to add some new gameplay elements - I didn't like the characters, and they felt like they don't add enough to the plot. What small importance they had, they could have been part of act 1 to complete it as a full story. Act 3 at least has a ""twist"" that I didn't find exciting, especially that it was mentioned somewhere around the half of it, the main character just simply acted like he didn't hear anything. - There are tons of side quests in act 1, act 2-3 barely has any.- The main story is unfinished. You do act 1-3 for basically nothing, because the story is only finished in the 3rd DLC. That's a big no. A DLC should add more to the main story, not finish it. - It's way too overpriced. The funny thing is, all 3 DLCs solved some of these issues. The 1st DLC had the most random plot ever, but it had the most likeable characters and a good combat system. The 2nd DLC had horror elements and felt like the Joy had actual effects and the 3rd DLC has a good combat and stealth system and it finished the story. Is it worth playing? Well, yes. I can't say no, since I liked the half of it, but it has too many stupid flaws for me to give a completely positive review. Yet, even though I'm very tempted to change my review to negative, I don't hate it enough for a completely negative review. It should be a mixed one.Is it worth buying it for the full price? Absolutely no, not now, not ever. I know they'd already updated and fixed a lot of bugs and glitches, but it's still a no. A game with an unfinished plot is not worth the full price. I recommend it only on sale together with the DLCs. In the end, maybe I should have just taken my Joy to forget about all the bad things about this game. But I decided to remember.";19 January, 2020;
We Happy Few;A;NOT INFORMED;701 people found this review helpful14 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 72.6 hrs on record;"My first playthough since release took 30 hours to finish act 1 of 3, looting and mapping everything not nailed down: So why, considering the time I spent in it, am I not recommending it? Because you probably have higher standards than me, which this game may have changed. So, I'll go over everything I experienced, and exactly why I stopped playing.GAMEPLAY: We Happy Few is a survival open world game, with crafting, stealth, and combat. So, how well does it do any of that? Poorly. Crafting consists of going everywhere and bigging up a bunch of stuff that you will probably never use to make stuff that you probably won't ever receive the recipe for. Unless you are attempting to be non-lethal (as I was) you will desperately look for one of the three non-lethal weapon recipes to craft, but otherwise you can just pick up more weapons than you'll ever need off of any mook. On top of that, you'll craft medical balms, bandages (if bleed even exists), and sunshine (if you were, like me, doing a non joy run). That is all the crafting system is actually used for, and in an odd turn of events, by the end of the game I had so many crafting parts that I didn't have recipes to use, even though I did every quest. Combat is dull and simple: You swing your weapon at the enemy and they die. Sometimes they start blocking: In which case you walk around them and swing until they die. You are given a ""shove"" feature that is basically a waste of code, and some truly garbage throwing weapons: of which only one is non-lethal, and you don't get that until near the end. And you may have noticed, I said the enemies ""die"", even though I was doing a non-lethal run? Yep, that's because ""unconscious"" bodies are treated exactly the same as dead bodies. If you knock out a rat, you can even steal its meat.Stealh is roughly what you'd expect from games for the most part. You turn a corner, they stand dumbly at where you were last seen. You crouch slightly out of sight, bam you're invisible. You hide in a garbage can in an alley they chased you down and they'll stand there for a couple minutes before getting amnesia. But then, in a very brave twist for modern game design, the developers added a game changing function: If the ai see a dead body, what do they do? Exclaim that the person is indeed dead, and then stand there gawking, allowing you to add yet another corpse to the pile. No alarms, no panic, just standing. Oh, and by the way, that does also apply for unconscious people: Other AI will flock around and mourn for the sleeping man.So what this all adds up to is crafting a cricket bat with pillows attached, attempting to knock out some wellies in silence and on discovery turn into a cricket bat swinging machine, destroying all in my path. Oh, and when your health drops to 0, you don't die. You can just eat some balm from your pocket and enjoy life again, for as long as you have medicine.Also, the game just isn't challenging. Doing nonlethal and joyless I didn't die once and ended up with over 450 ""non-lethal kills"" as they call them. The area before the parade (the final location) is tougher than the parade. The only ""boss"" in the game gets knocked out with three padded cricket bat swings to the head.Whoops, I also forgot to say a very important piece of information: The entire time the game is glitching out. People walking in floors is something that is near impossible to miss. Objects ceasing to exist visually until relaunch. Occasionally people walk through walls. Quest lines which are literally impossible to complete. These are all issues that have been in the game since back in early access, where all the quests were exactly the same, before the big change. So they'll probably never be fixed.On top of that, how about that autosave system? You get stuck somewhere? Made a mistake? Game glitched out? Time to load that save from 4 hours ago and do it all again. Happened to me three times, and the final time marked the last time I'm touching this game. So, next on the list is:VISUALS: How's it look? Not great. The randomly generated environment is ugly as sin and glitchy, especially for the village segments. The textures and other graphics are just not very impressive, which would typically be passable if the game didn't run as bad as arma 3. On the ""Good"" preset, my (beefy) computer stuttered constantly and couldn't reach 60 fps.However, it is true that the design of the game world is on point for what it wants to be: Bleak and dead without joy, or bright and vibrant with it. It also captures the british weather and feel quite well, surprisingly. Really I wouldn't complain about the visuals if it wasn't for the lag and the generated environments.AUDIO: It's pretty good, honestly. Not much to say about it. Does what it wants to do pretty well, especially the in world music. The voice actors were also pretty good.STORY: Interesting at first, but soon peters off as soon as you figure out the big reveal. Then it keeps railing on about that reveal, without ever giving more info. Essentially, without spoiling much, Germany invaded England and demanded all children under 13 are to be sent to germany. And that's all we're told. All we know is that England lost the war, was invaded, and the kids are sent somewhere, and some time later everybody took enough joy to nearly forget about everything, while they're starving to death and not noticing it. What happened in the aftermath of the war? Where did the kids go? What is the rest of the world like? Why has nobody come to wellington wells to assist? None of these questions are answered, except that in the epilogue for the game you see a single child talk to arthur outside of wellington wells.On top of that, you don't influence the ending at all. Take joy, don't take joy, kill people, go non-lethal: Absolutely no difference. Just before you go to the parade, there is a perfect chance to add a branching path, but it doesn't.So at the end, it just leaves you with Arthur finalling leaving wellington wells, talking to some strange ""constable"" who clearly isn't, and leaving filled with self-loathing and depression. No matter how much of a hero or villain you were, no matter how much you relied on joy or refused it, there is no relief. In fact, looking at the ending of all three acts, it turns out that nothing you did as Arthur mattered AT ALL. Character B escapes happily on a boat, Character C gives wellinton wells the wake up call it needed to maybe (probably not) save itself, but what did Arthur do? Nothing. While this could be a statement, or an interesting end to the story, it really just feels like I wasted all my time.I chose non-lethal and joyless to ""be the change I wanted to see in wellington wells"" but at the end, much like Arthur, all I have is a feeling of regret. Regret that I wasted all this time doing something for absolutely no reason. Playing a game that was filled with issues praying that the story would be the saving grace, just for it to end so pathetically without any choice by me, has went and made this game one of the two games I regretted buying (alongside no mans sky).It had so much promise, but it ended up being what I bought years ago with a very slight change, and a story that ends up entirely unresolved. If the game is discounted heavily and the dlc is actually any good, maybe pick it up then. But for now, it's just a waste of what could have been, which costs significantly more than any sane person should pay.";13 August, 2018;

It was fun for what it was. I read about game breaking bugs and I went in hoping not to experience any but did. Got to an issue where you need a bucket from Dr. Faradey. I saw this was an issue all the way back from 2016 and the game still has this problem. The solutions were to ask quite a few times which didn't solve it or to enable dev command which I couldn't figure out to do. So with that said... can't recommend the game. It has game halting issues from 4 years ago. I did enjoy what I played tho and whatever I guess I got $5 worth of game out of it but seriously if the devs couldn't fix the bug why not just patch in a bucket there and be done with it. I read they were working on a sequel which I would have definitely been interested in but considering they couldn't fix this game, i'll take that as a red flag and stay away from future products;16 January, 2021;
We Happy Few;memorable;NOT INFORMED;182 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 90.7 hrs on record;We Happy Few is a game about sadness and how one must cope with it while everyone surrounding you is happy. They don't like downers, and will beat you to a pulp for acting as such! The overall game seems to focus around survival amongst not only the community but life in it's entirety. You lose your job to begin with and have to take shelter inside an old maintenance room inside the tunnels below the city. You constantly have to be on the lookout for everything. Even your clothes determines how people will react to you. If you show up in the slums wearing a fancy suit you can expect some sass from your fellow neighbors and maybe even a riot. Food and drink is necessary to survive in the game, aswell as sleep. Without a job and little coin left in your pockets you must often steal from the rich and poor so that you may give to yourself. Loot does NOT respawn! So one robbed house is a house robbed for good.The story starts with the player being ran out of town into the slums where all the 'downers' must reside just after the main character Aurthur loses his job for displaying a negitive mindset. He refuses to take his joy pill after reading a tragic news article which he couldn't just erase from his head. These pills are the staple of the town of Wellington Wells however, and they are maditory to take. You can take joy, enter the city ingame, explore and roam, but the actual plot has yet to be fully developed. Currently, there are only side jobs and a few main tasks that can be done.Would I recommend this game? Yes.;14 June, 2017;

We Happy Few;knock-out;NOT INFORMED;148 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 25.2 hrs on record;I really wanted to like the game. Technically, it's right up my street. British. Distopian. Looks like an action RPG, I was imagining something between Deus Ex, Thief, Bioshock and Dishonored. The early game even hinted of interesting choices to be made about the decision to take Joy or not. I also waited a long time for it be on offer too. Alas, 25 hours in. I think I'm done. Here are my top gripes with the gameArtwork + World: The entire game world I see 95% of the time looks like hasty copy/paste of the same assets and characters repeated, making it look like a cheap film set. Yet I passed through some lovingly crafted rooms at points during the story missions, which I was able to appreciate for about 5 seconds before moving on. This broke my immersion from the off - sorry guys. Gameplay: The sneaking and combat are two large parts of the game. Neither are very well implemented. Thrown items are almost useless and I spent a majority of the game with my inventory bursting from a vast assortment of weapons and items I had and never used. Really, a good quality electric trucheon ends most fights within a minute or two. I was excited to start Sally's story when I discovered she had a different style. Great! Only... the availability of crafting components completely prevented me from using any of her cool chemicals. I got frustrated not being able to find anything I needed for;13 January, 2020;

Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist;thefyrewire;NOT INFORMED;194 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,078.2 hrs on record;OK... given my playtime now, I think it's finally time for my review. No plot spoilers. A proper review would take a look at all aspects, but I don't have much time so I'll be brief. The Good - Singleplayer The game itself is surprisingly good. Of course... it's no Chaos Theory, but regardless, the game is actually fun. By playing on perfectionist, the game's hardest difficulty, you'll find yourself hiding and waiting a lot. examining the guards' patrol routes (which by the way change every few deaths to keep you on your toes). Also you won't be able to use your vision through walls, giving (albeit briefly) you that similar experience in Chaos Theory when you find yourself constantly wondering what's around the corner.So what else is there? A diverse array of gadgets, guns and accompanying upgrades for starters. I loved being able to use the money earned from missions to upgrades and improve my loadouts. There was a chain of progression, and I could feel my character becoming a 'stronger' spy, equipped with more stuff as the game continued.The environments are pretty damn awesome. Exploration is the key to achieving your preferred playstyle. There are neat cinematic scenes and unique parts of the story which require you to play out these almost 'mini-game'-like bits. but they're so well integrated into the story and allows you to take a break from all the running, jumping and stabbing. The Good - Multiplayer - Coop/SvMNow let's switch over to the multiplayer. There's not much to say about coop. It's essentially singleplayer but with a partner. There is a fairly wide variety of missions to choose from. Each of the main characters have varying game modes depending on what you're up for. Nearly all of them can be played solo if you don't have anyone to trust your life with.Grab a mic, join your friend, and off you go. That's right. A mic. Whilst not completely essential- it will drastically reduce the number of times you die because of silly mistakes. Bouncing information between you and your partner will really help. But... if you're with a random person you might not be able to do that. In which case, you'll just have to grit your teeth and go with the flow.Spies. Versus. Mercs. It's fun. Believe it or not, it's actually fun. With friends. By yourself... yeah, I'll admit, you can have some pretty decent matches. But seriously, for some laughs and a better chance at winning- play with friends you can talk to. Skype, TeamSpeak- it's all about information exchange. You can better anticipate that ambush if your buddy just saw a spy heading your way. You can let your friends know where the hacker is by utilising the merc cameras whilst your dead.The SVM loadouts are different to the singleplayer loadouts, so be prepared to start paying up the big bucks again. This time you'll also need SVM tokens, which allow you to purchase weapons and stuff. You only get a few when you start levelling up and then one token each level after that, so spend wisely. There should be enough to unlock everything, but it's the order you choose that matters. I'll be writing or recording an updated SVM tutorial sometime in the future, to help the new players with how everything works. You'll have fun creating custom loadouts with a combination of gadgets, gear and weapons to your liking and playstyle. The torso abilities are pretty cool. Each side (mercs, spies) get three choices of abilities to aid your plight. Used wisely, you can be a valuable asset to your team.Since Blacklist is 4 vs 4, it's the perfect number. Every player counts, and when your team mates goes down, you best be prepared for what happens next.On the face of it though, SVM is fun to dive into for a quick match (I say quick match, it's about 25 - 30 minutes per match). You can just join and start playing straight away. It's fast paced and will require some level of awareness and reflex reactions in order for you to survive. Playing smart is a key skill. Anticipating enemies, knowing your way around the map, always paying attention to the little things that might give away the position of a spy. Classic, Blacklist and Team Deathmatch are probably the only active game modes at the moment. The others could do with a reboot, as they're fun to play... when there's enough players. The Bad - Singleplayer I honestly can't really fault the singleplayer. There is one thing though. It can be very easy to speedrun. Grab one of the sniper rifles and just headshoot everyone. Job done. Of course, some armored enemies require a little melee time, but with two or three shots you can drop them just as easily. It can ruin the fun, but it's completely feasible.Oh, there's also the whole Michael Ironside thing. Yes, Fisher does appear younger. No, it won't stop you from enjoying the game. You'll get used to it. Or perhaps not. It's really up to you.My negative points reside mostly with the game launcher rather the game itself. Ubisoft only had to go and slap Uplay on its products AGAIN. Why even bother releasing this on Steam if it was going to need Uplay anyway?! For example. I load Uplay (ugh, I know) and click 'Play' on Blacklist. It then says... 'loading Steam. Please wait for your game to load from there'. Like... wut. Then Steam launches Blacklist, then it goes BACK to Uplay and Blacklist opens up. ???Not only the Uplay interface a pain to reach on a laptop (since it's Shift + F2 and laptop users have to press FN as well...) but it's slow as hell and actually caused me to crash Blacklist once.Ugh. The Bad - SVM Here we go. I'm leaving coop out of this by the way.Spies vs. Mercs feels like another company developed it and just slapped it onto the main game. Seriously. The sonar vision is completely different to the sonar vision in singleplayer, the way the stun crossbow works is different, there's no crouch sprint... the list goes on. When I first started playing, I got bugs. I mean... BUGS. One particularly game breaking bug was the fact that every time I went into cover and left it, I'd stand up and start sprinting around. It was hella annoying. Ubisoft put out THREE patches and none of them fixed it. It was only after I'd posted a couple ideas and experiments of the forums that someone else picked it up and fixed it. A fix, from the community ._.If you're buying Blacklist for the SVM, wait for a deal. SVM, in its current state, is just not worth it. Overrun with hackers and the likes, SVM has become a tense community, filled with paranoid players who don't trust each other. And why should they? With Ubisoft turning their back on the game, with no dedicated servers (Host changed. Migrating match.) and no anti-cheat system, you have no idea who could be hacking, or who's just damn lucky. Tired of the hackers? Want to quit the match? Tough. Ubisoft removed the Quit Match button to 'reduce the number of unfair rage quitters'. Uhm, wut.Seriously, all the more reason to team up with people you trust and can communicate with. You can still beat hackers, because they're dumb. They can whiz around and kill you with one bullet, but they're idiots who can still be killed with Death From Above and unexpected melees. Even hackers bleed. The Conclusion Conviction was fun, but Blacklist brings more to the table. With new ways to play, and new gadgets to play with, the singeplayer and coop are definitely a must. Just watch out for the SVM, it might not be what you were completely expecting. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is a 9 / 10 .;25 September, 2014;
Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist;Mastur;NOT INFORMED;179 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 47.7 hrs on record;Splinter Cell Blacklist feels like the kind of game where the team that worked on it really knew the franchise and really understood what elements of each game people loved and hated.Conviction, to me, felt more like an action game than a stealth game. Chaos Theory is one of my favourite stealth games.Blacklist takes all of my favourite elements from the older Splinter Cell games and gives them a facelift and includes some newer elements that Conviction introduced and refines them to be less overpowered but just as satisfying in action situations.The game encourages you to use the classic stealth techniques with the playstyle system but also allows you to fall back on the execute ability that Conviction introduces as a contingency (which makes you feel pretty badass when you pull off a preemptive execution on three or more guys after being spotted and managing to stay undetected).Favourite Splinter Cell so far.;11 June, 2017;

Abiotic Factor;Liquid;NOT INFORMED;253 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 87.3 hrs on record;"This review is spoiler free.Abiotic Factor is a game chimera of sorts. Immersive Sim, FPS, Survival Horror and of course Sandbox Survival. Enhanced by coop. It wears it's influences on it's sleeves but tries something very fresh. I'd argue it's a very strange beast indeed but in a very good way. It's early days but it's an incredibly promising game and most importantly grippingly fun.You're probably thinking ""Well, then which is it most of all?"", i'd probably lean towards Sandbox Survival but so critical is your ability to assess a situation and determine your own path with your current playstyle. It's very immersive simlike. And while it's ways of skinning a metaphorical cat aren't as expansive as a traditional immersive sim, it lets your gameplay expression be reflected through your character itself. Are you a defence analyst? Primarily focused on combat but willing to take a few downsides in xp gain to gain an edge in a fight? Maybe you're focused more on survival? Stealth is a pretty solid option, especially when you're opting to enter a new unknown area. Or perhaps you're playing with friends? You want to be the team player, healing your friends or keeping them fed? You too can be just as much a chimera as abiotic factor is, your playstyle might evolve as your tools expand, you might find one weapon class better than another for you. It also defines how you can handle any given situation, environment or enemy. It's in this that i truly believe this game functions as a cooperative immersive sim experience. The worldbuilding and story of Abiotic Factor is frankly the best part of it, it's up to you to navigate the maze of corridors. The secrets lying behind a keypad or a hidden vent. The game function primarily around a scientific facility amid complete anarchy and containment breach but it's also not afraid to step outside. The portal worlds as they are dubbed are smaller shorter adventures outside of your standard world progression, usually linear they are a welcome and pleasant trip even when short because of how sweet they are. Each setting is striking or unexpected and takes you by surprise, each presenting unique challenges to overcome. At first it doesn't come across as a Survival Horroresque experience until it's other inspirations start to reveal themselves. To which it will drive you into a unique form of paranoia that happens rarely in games like these. ""Is this safe to mess with?"" ""Should i take a lower profile so i don't risk a death?"" It's all mixed with a mystique when you find something strange and alien that you can potentially turn into a tool. ""Woah what's this?"" It makes you actively want to participate in the game and make you want to learn more about it's world, it's enemies, allies for any sort of advantage you can get to survive. ""Wait? This log talked about a weird creature that i might come up against! Which one was that again?"" You see what i mean? It's very well thought out. The environments of Abiotic Factor are characters in of themselves, each with their own unique layouts to figure out intertwined with it's secrets and items to discover and research. It can be so very rich when you get into that loop, it keeps you on the search constantly for that next new item to take advantage of. Keeps you exploring. The sandbox survival elements are a bit of a mixed bag at least to me and it drastically changes if you're playing in coop. The game really plays into a team dynamic and having more basecentric characters and more offensive characters working together to a goal, someone might be better as a crafter and keeps the base all tidy and maintains everything, filtering water, cooking food and planting crops that other players can take advantage of. You can ultimately play your character as a jack of all trades. You'll inevitably have to spec into a weapon of choice for sure if you want to stay alive. It's also much much more challenging a game in solo. You just will not have the manpower to do basecentric stuff if you want to progress at a steady and not glacial pace. This might intrigue you if you're looking for a challenge or turn you off if you're not willing to deal with having to do the work of multiple people but you can change multiple gameplay mechanics with a custom setting as you start up your game. I played with default and i do not recommend it for people who want a lax time solo. It's early days so who knows what will change?I've tried very hard to avoid spoiling anything on this game for a reason, i truly believe that there are many many surprises here that are best discovered yourself, including the inspirations that it wears proudly and all the charm this game has. I recommend it, yes of course but there are a few problems that will likely be weaned out of early access. (As of 07/05/2024) Mostly to do with a few mechanical annoyances,weapon balance, some sections to do with the main story questline and very rarely a bug. It feels like a game that still has quite a road ahead and it'll be frustrating if you hit a certain point with a dead stop that you wouldn't get if the game was finished. If you don't like that and can't forgive that, then i'd wait until later in the year. This game will be released by the end of the year and you'll have a much more complete experience but if you can't wait, i understand. The game is excellent.Sorry if you see a few typos, i'm writing out this review in a fairly tired state after completing the main content solo."; 7 May Early;

However, Vigor devs have been open from the start, release in early access get the game to a decent working order then release to everyone for F2P.

Bloons TD 6;Balorlord;NOT INFORMED;459 people found this review helpful252 people found this review funny; Recommended 913.2 hrs on record;? Bloons TD 6 is set in a near-orwellian dystopian future where humanity's evolution has taken an alternate path. Evolving us into hyper-intelligent monkeys running a banana-fueled economy, which has been propped up precariously with a monkey housing-market shadow-banking scheme (but with banana bucks and bloons). Use government sponsored bloon-money (read: blood-money) to hire genetically engineered super-monkeys, psychopathic mercenary soldiers, surgically-enhanced unfeeling cyborgs, feed live sacrifices to the monkey Sun God, and to generally create horrendous weapons of mass poppage that will help you on your monkey business preventing the EXTREMIST Bloon terrorists from passing through and INFLATING the monkey economy, POPPING the housing-market bubble your monkey government has entrusted you, Big Brother, to protect. Do your duty and prevent BILLIONS of innocent monkeys from spiralling into homelessness and poverty by keeping bloon-kind chained where they belong, floating the economy and holding up Big Banana Goverment.== The gameplay ==? BTD6 is a highly addicting tower defense game with amusing and diverse paths to create the mystifyingly satisfying noise that is balloons popping. (If you like the sound made by messing with bubble wrap, you've just found your gamer crack.) You start off placing your typically cheap monkeys-for-hire on the track, and gain progressive account-bound experience that unlocks tower upgrades and points for a monkey talent-tree that keeps you coming back for another go, while also keeping you from being overwhelmed by the insane mass of tower options and build paths you eventually have straight from the beginning. By the end of it you'll be plopping down mortars that can focus fire anywhere on the screen, helicopters that follow your cursor (or the enemy bloons if you're lazy), druids who spam chain lightning, and even necromancers who resurrect zombie bloons that move backwards on the track, popping their former brethren. == On the pay-to-win issue ==? Even if you're a player like me who typically hates grinding for unlocks, the gameplay is so satisfying I felt like I was making typical progress in a monkey RTS / RPG rather than being slogged down and penalized for not making in-game purchases. The pay-to-win isn't much of an issue in multiplayer either (it just means an easy co-op win).? If you're having trouble with the progression I recommend spiking your upgrade unlock rate without spending real money in a couple of ways: (A) Git gud and out-scale the bloon waves past the end wave into freeplay mode for BIG wads of player XP(B) Run a few maps blazing-fast over-and-over again for wave-based XP that goes towards towers present on the screen.(C) Getting lots of free the micro-transaction currency from first time map wins and challenges (hint: there is sometimes big bonus currency for winning a randomly selected map on each difficulty tier even after you've 100%'d, bigger on higher difficulty, and quests given on the home screen for even more). (D) use free OP towers you get from near-constant in-game events and map victories for play-to-win ez mode on challenges and maps you're too lazy to tryhard on, or (E) get carried by the bored 1000-hour randos in easy/intermediate queue who've ended up with WAAAY too much free micro-transaction currency and map-victory towers in co-op queue.== Some things of note + tips ==1) In co-op mode, the dev has made a brilliant design decision to prevent actual text typing and you instead communicate through a monkey-see monkey-do style emote menu. Communicate like its monkey Dark Souls.2) There is a massive, extremely NOT-casual difficulty spike as you go upwards towards expert maps. Get together with the bros for co-op and rip out your hair together while having tons of headache-inducing fun in voice chat on Discord, scheming how the hell you're supposed to win without backing onto your play-to-win towers that are straight-out disabled on certain challenges.3) I've seen this game on sale for $0.99 at least twice so far at the time of this writing, pop it on your wishlist and you might catch it that way again.4) By some form of dark magic, this game has an active Youtube community with lots of gameplay tips, tricks, and mind-exploding big brain tower micro for you to dig up. Give it a search!== TL.DR == go try Bloons TD 5 on NinjaKiwi's website and imagine that but better;26 November, 2020;

Nope, we're getting a Battle of the Bulge map.

If that - and their track record - isn't corporate speak for ""we just can't be bothered to do the research you're used to"", I don't know what else is.So it's gotta be another la-la-land fantasy map like we got for El Alamein - again, in stark contrast to the true-to-reality maps we are used to from the original developers. Hell, you can go visit landmarks from the game today if you are in the area.So, to sum it up: The game itself is fine in its basics, but quality of the recent releases is a real letdown. Lots of community servers just run the old BM stuff and keep the new maps out of rotation(which does put people who want to play the Brits at a disadvantage though), and usually those are the servers with the most fun games. Still worth checking out, so maybe not dismiss it out of hand based on a bad review from a bitter old veteran.But since all purchases will go directly into Team 17's pocket and he best way consumers can leave feedback for a product is with their wallets, I absolutely would not recommend paying full price for it.

Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes;Baobaobaobao;NOT INFORMED;139 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Recommended 69.9 hrs on record;One of my favorite JRPGs is Suikoden 2. This review is me comparing it to that.This is a game that feels like it was made during that era of JRPGs. It ticks all the boxes. Tedious random encounters, not being able to save anywhere, archaic minimal hint based objectives.I played through multiple 60+ hour jrpgs (FF7R2, Unicorn Overlord) this year and this is by far my favorite out of all of them. Compared to Suikoden 2 though, the game Eiyuden is heavily based on.This game just can't hold a candle to the PS1 classic.The story feels like they played it safe, It's more heroic than S2's Dark Grim Crisis-filled story, While there's nothing wrong with something more lighthearted. I really wanted something that made me feel the same way as Luca Blight did in S2. This doesn't make the story bad though, just more predictable and cliche.The character recruitments are one of the strongest points of Eiyuden. Suikoden 2 also has all the mundane very forgettable recruitments but I think that's just part of the charm. There's always a character for someone in this game.The combat is awesome. A lot of people say the enemies are very spongy but if you experiment with some characters some of them turn out to be insanely good, to the point where some of them can 3-4 turn bosses by themselves. So ofcourse people are gonna struggle if they keep using the character that shines later and hits for 85 per attack instead of the character that comes out of the box doing 300 per turn. So I made sure to experiment with character combinations and that made the game much more deep for me, despite it being really simple.Overall, If Suikoden 2 is a 10/10 for me. This game is an 8. I highly recommend it. There's nothing like this right now and with S2 Remaster in the horizon. There's no better time to enjoy this love letter to the franchise. RIP Yoshitaka Muruyama, And thanks R&B, 505 games for this fun and amazing game.; 29 April;

After reading a bunch of other negatives, people might get the wrong idea so it's important for me to emphasize. The quality of this games translation is bad. Embarrassingly bad. Your college professor would flunk the game outright.To get more into detail, there are consistency issues with formatting, grammar, and characters. It starts pretty simple and balloons outwards. The least offensive is menu information. To emphasize again, these are things that would normally never even rise an eyebrow and are only included for completeness; 23 April;

Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes;A;NOT INFORMED;501 people found this review helpful17 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 9.6 hrs on record;I played Suikoden II back when this game was announced, as I'd heard a lot of great things about it, so I was definitely curious. In anticipation of this game, I have also played the spin-off Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising, which was pretty mind-numbing, and something I pushed myself through as quickly as possible. I'm not a backer, but I have been an interested lurker throughout the games' development.I apologize in advance for a pretty negative review. In general, I'm actually mid to positive on the game (unfortunately Steam doesn't allow a neutral review), but there's definitely a feeling of a death by a thousand cuts here. Lots of little annoyances and frustrations add up, which has led to my current outlook.I don't hate it, I just wish it lived up to my expectations more. I wanted an enhanced, modernized, and improved Suikoden experience. Instead, I just got a Suikoden experience. That might be exactly what some people want, but it's not what I wanted.At times, the game is great, but most of the time, it's very mid. I can't recommend it at full price unless you've specifically played similar titles and want more (quite literally, more of the same). If that isn't you, then I'd really recommend waiting for a sale.The Bad:This is a list of things that are needed to improve the game:- Better English translation (sometimes it's not even close to the Japanese dub and left me wondering if the translation team would have preferred to be the writing team with the liberties they're taking)- Graphically, the sprites are great, but don't fit in the 3D world whatsoever. In general, the 3D world has very minimal detail and is very sparse at best. It's just not fantastical whatsoever. There's a moment where you cross over a rope bridge between two canyons and I sat back expecting a wide camera shot to show off the environment and... nothing. Blurry blobs in the background that are rough mountains. No vista, no nothing. During set pieces there is an artistic vision, but that vision is not shared with the other 99% of the experience- Monsters/bosses are not pixel sprites and lead to this weird clashing of art styles. I don't inherently prefer sprites to 3D, but please just pick one as the art director and stick with it, then everything would just gel better. I am a huge fan of the Octopath Traveller series, though, so perhaps I'm spoiled in that sense (Team Asano are incredible)- The quasi open-world elements are empty and tedious to run through- There is no sprint button, you have to dungeon delve for an equippable item that boosts run speed. Why? There's a button for walking, though...- Battles need to move faster. For random encounters, it's largely a one hit-KO deal, but you'll be there for close to a minute regardless- Button inputs need to be accepted faster (menu scrolling is a delayed nightmare, as is spamming 'attack' in battle)- No main character avatars are present during the 'war' battles, instead replaced with generic character models that come from the early 2000s (it almost looks like I'm playing The Settlers 2 HD). At times, you will see a speech bubble from a recruited hero, but it's just so basic that it leaves you frustrated that there isn't more- The war battles are slow, need a fast-forward option, and really aren't that fun whatsoever. They were interesting in Suikoden II, and I was expecting more, and I wanted a true evolution because it's a really cool mechanic! Unfortunately, they were just underwhelming to the point of almost being embarrassing. They could be removed entirely, and we won't have lost anything (perhaps we would have gained elsewhere as a result)- The menu buttons are inconsistent. Sometimes, you can press the back button, and it'll exit a prompt, other times you won't be allowed to do that and have to press a specific button instead- Pacing. There are times when I'm having lots of fun and then the game will jackknife into hours long sections that are incredibly slow and dull. After the initial HQ you have three routes to explore, all of which have an NPC 1/5th of the way in saying you can't progress any further. Why??? What's the point in having an open-world if I can't go off and explore? - Some heroes are incredibly annoying, but you'll be stuck with them for several hours because you need them to fill a specific role- It's not always clear what range a character has, or why. So you'll often blindly experiment, hoping for the best. I don't see why we can't change formation mid-battle either- Healers are effectively pointless. With such large MP costs for healing, you feel like you need to horde MP for boss battles - but then when you do, you'll quickly find that after 2-3 casts you're spent. Not to mention, there's really no use for offensive magic. Well, back to spamming items then...- Except that you have an inventory limit. Because you have such limited healing ability, you'll find that even with maxed healing items you'll be running on fumes by the end of a dungeon, limping your way through. It's just as well the random encounters are weirdly timed- Character designs are voices are incredibly mismatched at times, it's actually kind of impressive how wide this gap can be- Scripted sections will occasionally have you follow this pattern: talk > awkwardly run > battle > talk > player manually runs > talk > battle > repeat 4-5 times. I appreciate it's to give me time to heal, but it breaks the tension immediately, and really just serves to highlight that they know healing is a gameplay issue and as such, solve it by giving you a break after every scripted encounter- Occasionally you'll get weird audio artefacts. One character voice will be far louder than another, then another will suddenly have way more bass than their previous line. Or you'll get the music not fading out correctly when moving between one area to another- Character speeds are often far lower than enemies. This means that you might get one attack off before they hit you. Except that enemies often attack in rows or columns, so one random encounter can brutally punish you just for existingThe Good:Okay, that was a lot of bad. Here's some good:- The music is mostly great, the big scenes hit well, and the dungeon themes are surprisingly dynamic and interesting- Boss battles are mostly interesting, though do suffer a bit from being damage sponges. There are 'gimmicks' (what an awful, awful naming convention by the way, why aren't they called tactics?) that are boss-specific environmental systems/attacks. They can at times be a chance-based system too, which gets annoying, but overall if the pace was quickened they'd be great- The battle system in general is great. The camera (when it works) is really dynamic and gives it a sense of fluidity. I'm hoping it gets more tactical/strategic later on with more character combinations and abilities- The story is quite interesting so far. When the writing is good, it's great; 23 April;
Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes;Meat-King,;NOT INFORMED;87 people found this review helpful10 people found this review funny; Recommended 161.0 hrs on record;"O fantastic captain… I sent you to solve one of my problems, and instead you’ve multiplied them.” Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (2024) represents a Japanese role-playing game (JRPG), developed by the company Rabbit and Bear Studios and published by the company 505 Games. Pros & cons: ++ Meet the members of my dream team, straight from the mental asylum. Mighty Mellore, a delusional sorceress in a sailor moon costume with late-stage OCD for justice one liners. Youngling Yusuke, the misunderstood gangster with his hands glued to his pants and the tendency to kick his enemies into a bloody pulp. Fierce Franscesca, a stereotypical tsundere character with a split personality. And yes, I can fix her! Crazy Carrie, the petite blond who is one teleportation away from summoning a demonic creature from the immaterium or falling victim to the infamous turning-the-inside-out incident. Muscle mage Maureus, a beefcake with a severe concussion trauma believing muscle points (MP) are the most crucial metric for determining how much magical power a caster can draw from. Punisher Prunella, the last survivor of a dwarven commando unit likes to clean her massive bazooka, that I call Fatman, at the campfire while telling stories about past war crimes.+ You will be buried under an avalanche of 71 playable characters, who you can assemble into a team of six to fight a power-hungry empire that threatens to annex your worthless fishing village. But you will abandon your main quest soon enough, because of the countless distractions in form of customizing your castle, cooking, fishing, playing cards, spinning tops, and starting a breeding program for pseudo-chocobos. And for the ambitious among us, enter a neverending dungeon with overpowered mobs to reach your final form. Then steamroll the rest of the campaign.o The supposed challenge of the cooking mini-game confuses me. I simply served the unwashed masses fried eggs, omelets and apple cider soda every time, and effortlessly rose to the status of culinary godhood.- Some scripted sequences have a massive delay before they continue, e.g. the first duel on the bridge, or the song with the shi’arc. It required the patience of a saint to sit through those lags.-- Dear developers, where is my option to double or even triple the speed during combat sections? Just look at The Last Remnant (2009) for such a quality-of-life feature. Heresy, I hear you scream as you try to suppress your tears and clutch your little game codex. But, to quote my arch-enemy and grand illusionist Todd Howard: it just works. Summary: To roam the realm of Allraan with the farmer-turned-warlord-protagonist Nowa and my bizarre team of MIN/MAX characters, provoking encounters and hoarding ridiculous amounts of money and resources for the end game weaponry of mutually agreed mass destruction, constitutes my only purpose in this game.Recommended for JRPG freaks eager to refill their nostalgia meter.

But also its 2024, where is the Suikoden vibes, gameplay mechanics, and pacing, but with QoL features and a better UI than what we got? So much of this game is confusing, even coming from a background of having played Suikoden 1 - 4. So many things also don't work, Eiyuden is really buggy and broken. For example, the cooking contests. you can only win them with two different recipes and that's it, use anything else and the judges will rate your meals a 0/10. The PC version has a broken frame rate that is tied to your encounter rate, so if you play above 60fps, you'll just never get a random enemy encounter. There is also a bug that will prevent you from getting a recruit as well which can lock you out of getting some endings. Then there is the god awful english localization, and how bored the english voice actors all sound when delivering their lines. The combat animations are great at least! The combat is a joy to watch, and R&B Studios really nailed this aspect of the game. Its the one thing that took what looked and worked great with Suikoden and improved upon it, even if everything else is outdated. Balance though can feel completely out of whack, and some mechanics are pointless or make no sense. There is front and back lines for your characters. Some characters cant fight or do certain attacks if they are behind the other characters in your party. This is fine on paper! But the game never tells you about this, you just have to experiment and hope you get it right, and then remember who can be placed where. There is no saving anywhere you want. Come on now, this is a gigantic RPG releasing in 2024, there is no excuse for this. Especially since you'll have long stretches of story followed by multiple combat encounters, and you won't be able to save. In one instance the Inn was right there, but an NPC prevented me from going over to it to save. I had to just continue on and hope for the best, when all I really wanted to do at that point was take a break from playing. The rest of the game though just feels lifeless and devoid of any personality. Pacing can be really bad and a huge chore. You will be backtracking a lot because new recruits become available to find in previous locations as you advance through the story. And you have to be careful with this because some of them could become unavailable later on. So you're kinda forced to do all of this backtracking.Inventory space is also very limited, and items can only stack a few times. Like healing herbs can be in stacks of 6 only, and then take up another inventory slot. Later on you get expanded inventory though, but its still a huge inconvenience for no reason until you get there. Why even have limited inventory space to begin with if you're going to just arbitrarily expand it later on anyways? I really want to recommend this game a lot, but its held back, and is missing so many Quality of Life features, and has a lot of outdated design, that it's a really tough game to enjoy. I love Suikoden, but I was hoping we would be getting that experience in something a bit more modern, not to mention vastly more polished then what we got.; 23 April;

If you like classic JRPG's and enjoy a classic kinda figure it out yourself character collecting game with some grind, this is the right game for you. If you want something deeper and more personal with a detailed lore/history and in-depth tutorials, its probably not the game for you.Is it a perfect game? No. Is it enjoyable? Heck yes. Does it remind me of the Suikoden series? Heck yeah!!!! Is a carbon copy? No. Did the devs make mistakes? You bet. Do I regret my purchase/support? No.Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes has its pros and cons like every other game. Below, I will review some pros and cons and some comparisons with the Suikoden series.Story/Characters:Pros-Very similar Suikoden vibes.-I like the diverse cast of characters in terms of how they look and different races/tribes of people. Thats always been something the Suikoden game excelled at so it was reminiscent of it. And yes there is a LGBT+ character in this game and its not that deep.-The story makes subtle references to other places that you do not see at the end of the game. Such as a University known for education and its observatory. Even some characters are from this university or has been there in this game. This was similar to Suikoden I and II where they referenced other places and then introduced them later in the series.-There are lots of heroes to collect and I believe there's about 120 characters.-There are lots of minigames to play. My favorite is probably the card game. There is a beyblade-esque game too.-Has a killer/catchy theme song that is mostly in Japanese but then goes ""hundred heroes"" which was awesome.-They definitely acknowledged the backers that helped make this game and I thought it was cute seeing people on reddit say they found themselves in-game.Cons:-The story could have been written and told better. Everything was there for a reason. They did not focus on building the characters relationships with one another. Lets just say even the game itself had some scenes where you see a black screen and it just says 6 months later...a few weeks later...etc.-They tried to copy the bond/rivalry of Suikoden II between Riou and Jowy but failed with Nowa and Seign. This made their duel anticlimatic because they knew each other for a day before war split them which as a reader/gamer, you did not feel the emotions they were suppose to feel. -Localization could have improved but I understood what was going on just fine. The dialogue from certain characters was questionable. I found a lot of very annoying characters, mostly hyperactive/loud/obnoxious female characters but I think that's a JRPG trying to make them cute thing which I personally don't like. -They skip over a lot of important lore or things that could have expanded the world. I'm not sure if this is due to them wanting to expand it later, but they missed a big opportunity here and this is probably why a lot of negative reviews says it feels rushed. They focused on the storyline and that was it.-There are parts in the game where they just tell you to literally go find characters to recruit which doesn't flow well and seems forced.-They released the game with a bug that caused you to be unable to recruit a character but they fixed it within the week of its release.Battle/Turn-based GameplayPros: They improved on the rune system in my opinion. Adding rune slots beyond the 3 from Suikoden's head/left/right arm was such a great improvement. This provided an opportunity to make some characters fit what you want them to do while still giving characters some uniqueness with exclusive runes and restrictions. -Most characters will have at least one level 3 magic rune and a few stat enhancement or skill runes. Some even have an anything you want rune slot. One special character even has all of their runes at level 4 as anything you want. -Removing rune charges for MP was also the best thing they could have done and having MP restore items and rune shards. This allowed you to kinda tinker characters stats and in this case you can adjust their MP should you want. -The auto battle system works well for lazy people if you know how to set it up properly and pay attention to your characters speed/sp/mana management.-Characters will learn and open up new rune slots as they level up. Some exclusive runes are learned this way instead of being found which Suikoden didn't offer and locked behind rune charges.Cons: -The instructions on battles can be confusing but once you know the basic, its actually quite fun. -A lot of people will struggle with how SP is generated and the game does a poor job of explaining it. Basically SP is randomly generated based on the luck stat. Not all character will use SP or have the ability to do so. If you have high luck, you have more chance of gaining 1 or multiple SP after each round. -Stats of some characters can be very random and unappealing such as a mage that has higher strength than a warrior or a mage with less MP than a warrior. The consistency seems a bit random and I'm not sure who worked on these numbers. Personally, it didn't get in the way of the overall enjoyment.-They removed the dojo's/skill enhancer/grades which I really loved in Suikoden III/V. This means that many characters can hit multiple attack counts, but it doesn't seem to make any difference in terms of hit counts/overall damage. In fact, multiple hit counts are pointless and does not offer any incentive.-The hero combos cost too many SP from each character and the damage is not worth the turn or SP cost.-There are no range physical skills that are good which makes rangers inferior. Its a mage/warrior kind of game. There's like 3 useful tanks, but tanking and covering is all rng and luck based.DuelingPros: The cutscenes during the duels throughout the games are pretty cool and fun to watch.Cons: The combat itself is not enjoyable because it forces you to select certain options to continue with the animation so you can't just attack them to the end or use your special whenever. In previous Suikoden games you could do whatever you want and it made a big difference.Warfare/Strategic BattlesPros: You see (what I believe to be) random backers and their names being killed in battle lol. Besides that there aren't really any pros.Cons: I found the war battles so boring and useless. You can't really edit your team. You select and move them and have little to no control otherwise besides some 1 use skill that can't be improved upon. Your characters stats doesn't matter so you can't just obliterate everything and can still die from something stupid. I'm not sure how this is calculated but this is the worse part of the game. I wish they stuck to Suikoden III and how you can still influence the map yet still choose what you want to do.So yes, I wrote a lot, but I also enjoyed the game for what it is. Did it exceed my expectations? No. Was I happy with my purchase? Yes. Because I supported a game and it delivered a game that brought joy and memories. Can it improve? Absolutely. I hope people give it the chance to because there is so much to this game and I hope the dev's will listen and improve on these things."; 27 April;

But gameplay from the late 90s / early 200s without any kind of effort put into improving it, however, is NOT.It has it all: Ditzy teleporting magic girl, red and blue knights, the elven trio, you name what Suikoden had, this game has it.THAT SAID, there are a few things to talk about.Point 1: It's crazy to me that this game is published in 2024, and 90% of the characters you can put in your team are subpar. That was ok in the 90s, but this is NOT ok now. Either reduce the playable character pool or spend more time balancing the characters you choose to make playable.Point 2: Game balance - a certain character whose name starts with an M basically trivializes all the content that comes after you obtain said character.Point 3: Pick better translators. I don't care about the whole woke debate, but seriously, the English translation is at points too poor. At least you can easily patch that though (using a mod though).Point 4: The cooking battles are a tradition, but you do not need something that feels like 20+ battles. Moreover, I won every single one by using poached egg / fried eggs and OMELETTE AS A DESSERT. That literally makes no sense, and again, it's just laziness on the programmers' part.Point 5: At stage 4, building everything in the castle is gated behind getting items for construction that only appear each in ONE dungeon, and you can only get 6 per dungeon (with the support who increases the yield...) or through missions in the mission guild that, you guessed it, require those elements to actually be unblocked first.And on top of that, you then have buildings which require an element that can ONLY be obtained through clearing missions. And missions last 30 minutes, with no way to speed them up.Anyone saying ""This is optional"" obviously does not play JRPGs. It's not REALLY optional, unless you do not plan on finishing the game.Again, this is 90s gameplay. Not ok in 2024.Point 6: Tbh, the story itself is bland as hell, and that is because (I realized it at the end of the game), it does not have that true rune driving it Suikoden had. This is just a war story. The justification is mildly mystical, but in the end there is no real driving force. You talk about the empire, but you never do see an emperor, either.If you take all this into account, I have two conclusions:1. Are you a Suikoden fan? Buy it and enjoy it.2. Are you a hardcore JRPG fan, and are used to this kind of formulaic gameplay? You might enjoy it.3. If you are neither, then this game is a HARD pass."; 9 May;

Make no mistake, they fully intend to try this again as proven by years of experience Total War: Three Kingdowms and Total War: Rome 2.-People here often forget the dual nature of the main current sticking point. They have decreased the content amount for DLCs AND raised their prices simultaneously. They are claiming rising prices. No specifics, just vague pointing towards 'economy, inflation or something I dunno'.-They have issued a veiled threat to players essentially alluding to the discontinuation of the game's development if WE do not meet THEIR sales quota as if we are their employees that have to take it from them. They also managed to slip in a dangling carrot in front of the more easily manipulable players, citing all the wonderful content they have planned. If only we would gobble up their products without question.Here is the direct quote from them:""this is the business reality of supporting WARHAMMER III and ensuring we’re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned.""SO CAN WE BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS OF INCREASING PRICES?No, not really. CA basically employs a lot of dirty tricks meant to 'maximize profits'. The issue with this incredibly tired, disproven, short-sighted thinking is that it simply doesn't work. And it never has.But to expand upon my point, here are some circumstances to consider:-CA has numerous critiques on Glassdoor about the low salary compared to other players in the industry.-They put a third party anti-tamper solution into their game called Denuvo. This DRM technology has a proven track record of slowing games down by increasing the millisecond time for frame generation as well as decreasing the FPS of games. Sometimes even by 30+ percent. A game like TW 3, which already has a pretty steep system requriement, this is an uncalled for. Also, CA could have taken the money and give it to developers instead of Denuvo. Clicking the End Turn button should not be dreaded.-CA, a studio founded in 1987, employing 882 people (as per Wikipedia) and being bought by Sega in 2005, received a 5 million GBP grant from the UK government that is meant for startup companies. -Their parent company Sega also keeps receiving the VGTR, the Video Games Tax Relief (20 million GBP per year), that they have then used to wipe out the corporation tax bill of CA entirely since 2014-Also, jsut to see what companies we are talking about, here are their revenues:Sega revenue (2022): 3.14 billion USDCreative Assembly revenue (2021): 62 million USD-CA sold over 22 million copies in the Total War series by 2018 (according to Sega themselves after TWWH 1 and 2), I invite you to extrapolate from partial information where they may stand now.-Wholesale workstation and hardware prices have gone down after the post-pandemic chip shortage is over.-(1st. EDIT as requested by Dance Commander) CA actually tried to put the Red Shell advertisement program into their launcher. While the original public optics all stated that Red Shell is simply an advertisement tool, it later turned out to be the textbook definition of a spyware software. Here is an excerpt from the 2018 Polygon.com expose:Begin quote - ""...the spyware sells itself as a means for video game makers to “uncover where their players come from through reliable attribution.” It “matches” whether players with Red Shell installed on their games visited a market’s campaign, whether Facebook and Twitter, YouTube, a web page or others.To do this, Red Shell has to follow what users are doing outside of the game. But the company said it does not collect any player’s personal information, and only collects information about their browsers and devices “for purposes of attribution.” "" - end quote.On a personal note, I would like to point out that Red Shell:-never actually disclosed what data/datapoints they are collecting-when requested for this disclosure, they did not do it (in direct violation of GDPR)-Red Shell never asks you for your consent to run and you cannot opt out-Red Shell runs even when the game doesn't -Several ad blockers doesn't even let you go to their webpage without first being warned of it's contentsCA, after the public outrage, decided to remove it from their launcher. But they did try it, don't forget that. (end of 1st. EDIT)-(2nd. EDIT by me) After reading comments I would like to address some of them here. I won't just fling the ""shill"" tag around as it is reductive and doesn't advance the conversation.""dude...get a life, these games cost a lot"": Formulating a critical opinion about something someone cares about is considered a bad thing just because it costs a lot of money to make? That is not a healthy mindset. By this logic I should just worship the makers of Star Citizen becuase they managed to sink a country's GDP into their half-baked shambling horror? Also, 2006 called, they want their insults back.""What a great review that says basically nothing about the game it is purportedly a review of"":A game review doesn't only have to be about the end product only. Sometimes, some events may require a peek at the workshop where it is made in or just warn other potential buyers about the full scope of a situation around a game. Making sure others are more informed before making a purchase is what this community is supposed to be about. I won't apologize for that.""Denuvo does not effect SSD's"":Indeed, you are correct. I did not do proper due diligence and check the date on several analyses I have based my statement on. Denuvo has since transformed their modus operandi and altered their process from excessive I/O operations, to certain 'custom event-based triggers'. Deleted that section, thank you for noticing. (end of 2nd. EDIT)IN CONCLUSION:Dear Creative Assembly and the two gentlemen who wrote that explanation/apology on the Total War blog. Game development is a service industry in the end of the day. If you bring a good product, people will buy it without questioning it. Furthermore, they will keep buying it for the foreseeable future as there is no stronger marketing tool in the walrd than word-of-mouth. That is of course unless the quality drops. Your studio will not be the first to experience what it is like to reach the point where people will just not care about your product enough.Furthermore, even if you start shipping good content again at reasonable prices, the stink of your decisions will taint that as well.Please do not fall into this downward spiral, it is getting very boring and I feel like I am Jeff Goldblum from Jurassic Park counting on his fingers:-company makes good product-company expands upon good product-non-creatives start dictating how to make product more profitable-non-creatives start bringing out charts and the Book of Drity Tricks-product suffers-more non-creatives are brought in to remedy a creativity-driven problem-parent company has enough-parent company demands more money-non-creatives bust out the Codex of Dirty Tricks-product dies and no one at the helm knows whyI leave it to everyone's discretion where CA stands in this process.P.S. (on a more cynical note):CA, pull yourself together, cut out the people making these decisions, pay your valuable employees from the freed up money and return to formula to flourish again. Also, please remove Denuvo, it is just a burden. Give that money to your developers instead.";1 September, 2023;

What's the rate of inflation again? How many millions did CA turnover in the last year alone? I've bought every single DLC for all three games up to now, as many on discount as possible as well as all three base games on discount, but started to get sceptical with the Champions of Chaos release especially after the state that game three released in, it was literally unplayable for me and many others at the time. How did it pass QA at that point? Anyway after some deliberating I decided that Champions of Chaos was fair value. Four legendary lords and a bunch of new Chaos units, I like Warriors of Chaos alot so I thought it was one of the better DLCs. Chaos Dwarves was right on the edge of the boundary of pricing for me, but I enjoyed it and got a fair amount of hours from it. I decided this upcoming DLC is just too far, £19.99 retail for a lord pack is crazy.Add to this the fact that we don't get quality of life updates such as bug fixes unless they're released along side a paid DLC is just sad. It has been three months (25th May) since we last had a major patch. After the release of that patch Nakai could no longer recruit Kroxigors, modders in the community fixed that almost immediately, but CA decided fixing a bug as significant as this, especially for a paid DLC character was not worth the time, until the next upcoming patch about three months later down the line.CA are wasting the potential for this game/series for the sake of trying to increase short term profits, I don't know if they can ride this out for the next two weeks until Shadows of Change releases as they're obviously under immense pressure. With their current stance I think they should be very worried not just about Shadows of Change, but also Pharaoh and Hyenas, although alot can happen in the coming weeks or months.Whilst I'm here and this is minor compared to the other problems, they never added back in the Chaos Undivided soundtrack that was in both game one and two. Of course community modders did though. On YouTube ""Chaos Undivided - Dynamic (Total War: Warhammer Soundtrack)"" if you don't know what song I'm referring to. Imagine your favourite faction without their soundtrack. A detail some people might not care about, but I think it shows CAs lack of attention to some of the aspects that made this series so good.Something that I absolutely hate about this game are the sieges. Towers on the walls that only shoot outside of the settlement? Fine, it makes sense. Towers lining the inside of settlements with 360 degree angle of fire, unlimited ammunition and if they are destroyed then they can be rebuilt. It is probably the one aspect of the game itself that I hate.For now I will leave this review as it is, hopefully something gives, the community for this game would be much happier if the pricing model for DLC was more sensible and didn't feel like we were being kicked in the balls. Regular updates with quality of life improvements and bug fixes not only alongside paid DLC would be very much appreciated, but I don't expect CA to do this.People can do whatever they want with their own money, but for now I want to suggest people hold off giving more money to Creative Assembly just to see if their attitude towards their consumer base changes to a more positive tone.If you want to add a comment to this review then feel free.Update 1st September -I appreciate the comments and everyone who took the time to read my and others reviews. After two weeks since leaving my initial review there still has been no communication from CA about the backlash from the community, apart from their default marketing campaign. They obviously went all in, as I write this the new DLC has already dropped out of the top 10 after being there very briefly and is now sitting around 16th. For anyone who doesn't know, the top 10 is based off of revenue generated, not amount of units sold. It was always going to get fairly high due to the excessively high price, but to see it already starting to fall is no surprise as not so many people are buying it. I would imagine they now wont sell many more units of this DLC.As for the new patch with the improved AI, well, I started a campaign as Khazrak and it is a steam roll. In battles the AI will have most of their 20 stack prioritise warhounds that will kite them around the entire map. The AI has been pretty bad for a long time now, but this is the worst and most easily manipulated I have ever seen it. They have made this game way too easy, I shouldn't be happy to be surrounded by enemies knowing that I can easily farm them all and will not lose a battle, let alone the campaign.CA's behaviour has convinced me to not only not buy this DLC, but also to not buy Pharaoh. Maybe the next DLC will be regular price, but for now this review stays indefinitely negative. My suggestions are fix bugs regularly, atleast once a month, every two weeks could be ideal. Balance passes, take care of the details like units being in the wrong rosters, soundtracks missing (WoC, Beastmen, Norsca) etc. Finally adjust your DLC model. Silence and the Fury, Shadow and the Blade, Twisted and the Twilight, Warden and the Paunch, that is 4 WH2 DLCs off the top of my head that came with 2 lords and 1 FLC lord. Now in WH3 we still get 3 lords but you took the FLC one and put it into the paid DLC, that doesn't warrant a 150% price increase.If you read all of this then you must be a masochist :)Update 14th December -It's been about three months since I last updated this review and so many people in that time have upvoted my review so I wanted to say again thanks for taking the time to read my long winded rant.Alot has happened around TW in the last three months, Hyenas was cancelled, Pharaoh had an awful launch and CA/Sega have obviously felt the consequences. As of the statement that CA posted today, they are dropping the retail price for Pharaoh, refunding current owners part of the price they paid and now the upcoming DLC for Pharaoh will be free. I do approve of them doing this, we all knew Pharaoh was a Saga title, it's retail price always should've been £25-35. I can't help but still be cynical though, this seems like an off-ramp for CA/Sega regarding Pharaoh. I think they want to see if the playerbase increases significantly with the new changes before committing too much.Now about Warhammer. Shadows of Change is going to get a 'major' update next year, by the wording in CA's statement it seems the £19.99 retail price for lord packs is sticking. I think we all have to wait and see if this 'major' update will justify that price. In SoC's current state I didn't even purchase it at £13 when it was on sale at a third-party seller recently. They are really going to have to add alot and improve the quality to justify their pricing. They're really playing a dangerous game in my opinion, but value is what matters. The next thing is, will I consider buying SoC before Thrones of Decay has released? I want to see the quality of the game's development increase and I want it to be consistently high quality. SoC could be revised and become the best DLC, but what if ToD at £19.99+ is another mess like SoC?But what's more important at the moment is the current state of the game. The AI is in a new awful state, the game is too easy. The hotfixes are appreciated but please CA, the AI needs more attention before more DLCs come.";18 August, 2023;

What was once a thriving studio and series has become a collection of broken promises, aggressive sales tactics, and outright threats on the community.While currently in the process of trying to walk all this back the damage has been done. DLC prices have increased while content has decreased. When concerns of this were raised the community was quite literally told to buy it or support would be dropped. When it was pointed out that support doesn't really exist due to the continuation of major bugs, broken AI, and gameplay balancing issues the response was to ban people. When it was pointed out that making a Hero Shooter with Hyenas was a terrible idea and the community wants Rome 3, Empire 2, or something along those lines again the community is told to shut up and get in line. Hyenas has been canceled to the tune of millions in losses and jobs cut. Somehow the problem in all this is the community.When Pharaohs got announced it was met with a criticism and push bask as a reskin of Total War Troy and pushing a Sagas title (smaller budget, scale, and price) as a full scale Total War release wasn't at all what the community wanted.Bare in mind during all this CA dropped support for Three Kingdoms because despite selling well and getting good response it wasn't big enough for SEGA/CA so they killed the project. Apparently a team of just 20 people work on Total Warhammer content now and CA's studio size has been reduced by 40% with hostilities continuing towards the community though CA is trying to walk it back with a non-apology once they got enough push back for banning mod creators on Steam which locked them out of updating their mods or even uploading new ones. Guess CA realized it wasn't the best idea ot remove those actually helping their game.I'm 100% in support of boycotting CA products until this sort of stuff is addressed and the community given the respect it deserves. I've been playing Total War games since the original Shogun hit store shelves back in 2000. There was a time when I held out hope we'd see Shogun 3 but these days I question if studio management and SEGA will allow the studio to continue long enough to release another game let alone something the community is actually interested in playing. Been over 10 years since Rome II released and since then it's been calls for Rome III, Shogun 3, Medieval III, and Empire 2 yet beyond the Total Warhammer releases they've largely missed the mark for bringing something new the community wants. Three Kingdoms had its success but CA and SEGA weren't happy with fan spending so despite being from 2019 the project is dead, buried, and forgotten about. Oh and CA is quick to blame Steam for their harsh treatment of the community. As someone who has moderated discussion boards on here before for games that's a load of crap. But CA is used to shoveling crap to fans so it is on brand. RIP Creative Assembly.;30 October, 2023;

They've also gone to war with some of their best YouTube channels like Legend of TW. Frankly,";"2 December, 2023 Total War: Warhammer 3 - An Actual ReviewIt's quite difficult finding an actual review on TW:Warhammer 3 as the Steam page is taken up by CA's exploitative DLC policies, their dumb forum comments and the White Knights trying to defend everything. I'll get to all that stuff in a while. But how's the actual game?Game PlayJust in case someone doesn't know, here's the quick and dirty about the TW series. It's a turn based 4X game on the strategic map and a expansive RTS on the tactical battles. It's geared more towards combat (eXterminate) than the other 3Xs (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit) with those engaging RTS fights. If you really are new to the series this game has a pretty thorough tutorial as well. Bonus points for that.As someone who owns all 3 TW: Warhammer games, I'm actually at a bit of a loss to find the differences between War 2 and 3. There are different factions available in Warhammer 3 and some quality of life improvements, a few new interesting mechanics and expanded settlement battles. The settlement battles were divisive on launch but I personally I think they're decent if a bit confusing. The improvements are minor but they do add up.The combat maps are decidedly better, with a few more obstacles, hills and the like to use to your advantage. The maps have come a long way since the wide-open Warhammer 1 maps. Graphics have been improved over the life of the series and the game is really a joy to look at. Of course, there are the new factions. I've been playing Grand Cathay for the last 30 hours and they ""feel right"" to me. I like generally playing the good factions and tend to turtle a bit. Having a faction with some decent troops behind a huge wall is kind of up my alley. But I'm looking forward to playing some of the other factions as well. That's the thing about this series, especially if you have the prior games and DLCs. As long as you don't get bored of the game play, there's always someone new to play.The main draw of either is in owning the previous entries. War 2 has the Mortal Empires mode, which combines the factions and maps of Warhammer 1 and Warhammer 2 (if you own both games on the same platform). Warhammer 3 has the Immortal Empires game mode, which has the combined maps and factions of all three games. It's massive, with about 180+ factions playing at the start. But if you don't own the prior games, you're going to be very, very frustrated when you open the game and find there are around 25 different factions to play and you have access to maybe 6 or 7 of them.

We don't play it to do missions. We don't play it to go ""click click click"" like a mobile game. We don't play it to go around checking fuel levels on half of the buildings or to constantly need to bring dinos to a medical center.We play to build a park. I long for the days of a simple sandbox style Jurassic...Park/World park builder. The formula is incredibly simple:- Random gen (or just a set number of hand crafted maps) a map- All dinos available to be researched and cloned immediately. Just need the building and money to research. None of this ""unlocking it"" BS that requires you to photograph a dino jumping on another dino while peeing just to get access. None of this ""get X stars in challenge mode"" to get the dino you want. (Jurassic Park Operation Genesis comes to mind)- Missions should be a thing you do on the side, if you want, but not required. - Build a profitable park with attractions, stores and shops, keep visitors safe and happy, keep dinos happy, investors happy, and enjoy designing a beauitful park.- Sandbox options to make it as easy or as difficult as you want. Things like starting capital, dino need level ""Forgiveness"" (how demanding the dinos are to keep happy), and the like. (Yes, sandbox sort of has this...but you only really get to enjoy it fully after you've unlocked everything...which requires you to do the missions...which is NOT why we play. You should get this mode right at purchase)If anyone wants to make bank, who has the skills and capital, I could easily see an indie dev coming along and putting this entire gaming franchise in the grave simply by following a formula that works with what we want. That game becoming the ""City Skylines"" answer to the new, crappy Sim City, as an analogy.

Super funny when your gyro station gets attacked by velociraptors and your heli comes and makes the aggressor sleep in the middle of the track, just to get attacked again lol. - Game feels like a tutorial to the DLC- I'd agree with this one. The DFW Campaign is literally a tutorial. Chaos Theory seems like the true campaign, outside of DLC. That being said, I'd recommend the DLC. I love dinosaurs and played the heck out of the first ones and found them worth the price (on sale). - Game is difficult!- No harder than the first one, albeit the first one had a significantly better tutorial. It seems the sandbox mode (for the vanilla game) is the main part outside of Chaos Theory. Extra Info, for people coming from the first game:- ""Backup"" Generators provide power instead of substations, until you unlock substations. Hated this at the beginning, now I'm ok with it. - Dinos have fun idle behaviours, and lots of cool varieties of dinos- DIPLODOCUS MAKES IT'S LEGENDARY RETURN!

Monster Hunter: World;Reivaz;NOT INFORMED;756 people found this review helpful18 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,204.8 hrs on record;"I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ??????? dragons. What more could you want?";13 June, 2020;

After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.Previous Review:This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game.;23 March, 2021;

Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun.;21 August, 2019;
Monster Hunter: World;Raene;335 products in account;742 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny; Recommended 30.7 hrs on record;Now that this game has gotten a resurgence, here's a PSA.There's something called the Defender's Set in the beginning of the game. Now MH does nothing to explain it but it is basically endgame quality gear blueprint given to everyone in the forge from the beginning of the game. It's basically a means for players to speedrun their way through the game to reach Iceborne, the expansion. Literally speedrunning because the weapons do so much damage that it negates every reason to interact with basically every mechanic in the game. Monster weaknesses, equipment types, literally any reason to pop open the hunter guide, look at what a monster is weak to, where its weakness is, and what elements might help. All of this is useless with the Defender Set. Farming materials to make the next tier of gear, progressively getting stronger and basically interacting with the ladder of equipment or crafting as a whole is negated as well.If you want to play Monster Hunter with all its features, don't use the Defender Set. Because in the end the game is about the journey, not the destination. Learning how to be a monster hunter, and how to hunt well for your class is exceptionally fun in this game.But by all means if you want to breeze through this game, blowing past the entire base game just to reach the expansion where you'll most definitely get your ass kicked because you don't know the mechanics of the game, go ahead. In the end you're either learning the game in the beginning, or learning the game in the end. Benefits of learning the game in the beginning is that you have more content. Negatives of learning the game later is that you just wasted the base game away for no reason.;31 December, 2023;
Monster Hunter: World;Majii;315 products in account;780 people found this review helpful25 people found this review funny; Recommended 867.8 hrs on record;"If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!";9 November, 2018;

He killed me in an outpost when i was fighting 4 captains at the same time. So he became a captain. I was mad so I decided to hunt him down but when I went to his nemesis mission he absolutely destroyed me because fighting savages in this game gives you cancer. With all that rage I decided to go after him for the final time. I interrogated a worm and learned that.. Krosh will instantly die to fire. I always fought him next to hundreds of grog barrels but never decided to shoot one. So I find Krosh and lure him to a grog barrel and shoot it. He burns to death. When I was going to Shelob's cave in Cirith Ungol a familiar orc screamed ""ranger!"" It was Krosh again. He had cheated death but he was different this time. Instead of being called Krosh the Chop he was now called Krosh the Flame of War. He was wielding burning axes, his face was burnt and he was immune to fire this time. Sadly for him I had just learned how to kill savages so I used my new skills on him. He was not a strong target.After 30 In-Game hours I get a quest about killing a necromancer. When I arrived in Minas Mithil to kill the necromancer I see a familiar Orc between all those level 50 orcs i slayed recently. An orc that I used to mourn. A level 8 orc to be exact. Instead of attacking the necromancer i decide to see who this guy is. Turns out he is the one and only, Krosh the Flame of War. But this time instead of killing him I decide to recruit him. I hit him twice and he breaks. I recruit him and he joins my ranks as a level 14 captain. I train him and send him to fight pits for him to level up. Surprisingly he is very good at slaying anyone thats twice his level. I force him to murder all other captains in my ranks even the ones that sent me gifts. It was all going well until he came across Az-Agur War Master. A level 62 Olog. It was a very close battle but sadly Az Agur crushed Krosh under his giant mace. I kill Az Agur as soon as Krosh fell. I attempt to revive Krosh but I fail.. In the loving memory of Krosh the Flame of War aka Krosh the Chop. May he rest in flame.";16 September, 2022;

I attempted this with one called Dûsh. The second time I saw him, his title was rebranded to ""Dûsh the Shamed"" and he told me how terrible his life was now and how all the other Orcs were laughing at him, after which I fought him and shamed him again. The next time I saw him he became ""Dûsh the Unshamed"" and told me how he reveled in the title and embraced it and Orcs respected him more, he became even more powerful than he was at first, and I got a sense of comradery and respect for Dûsh. I chose to shame him again. The next time I saw Dûsh the achievement I desired popped up, except this time Dûsh wasn't speaking anymore, he was just making noises that sounded like a cartoon airplane stalling in the air (which made me laugh everytime I heard them, though now I realize they may have been his way of expressing his suffering). This is when I recruited him to be one of my captains. After some short time, he betrayed me. I had it coming. I deserved it. I thought I'd be able to recruit him again, except this time he had Iron Will, which meant he was unrecruitable and couldn't be friendly ever again. It was either I shame him again, or him and I fight to the death. Not being able to repeat the same mistake I made already, I thought to myself ""So this is it, old friend"" and fought him. I won. Defeating him gave me a very powerful legendary although the price was far from worth it. I just wanted Dûsh back. All of this isn't part of the game's story, it's unscripted, it's made up from randomly generated logic-branches of code that is nearly guaranteed to be impossible to get for anyone else, let alone my other playthroughs. The story Dûsh and I shared is special, it's our story. I'm sorry it had to come to this, Dûsh. Forgive me, old friend";29 April, 2021;

Upon respawning, I decided to track him down and re-arrange his face with my sword. Our brief encounter ended with him being thrown off a ledge and falling to his death, I thought nothing of it at the time.Little did I know I would encounter that same orc time after time again, the dude just wouldn't stay dead. Regardless of the injuries he sustained, he would always be back. I recognised this orc's admirable endurance for punishment, so naturally I decided to dominate him. He served as my bodyguard for many hours, and we went on countless conquests together. We attacked and defended forts, cut down enemy captains whilst adding others to my army. This orc began as a grunt, and has risen through the ranks, becoming a captain, an epic captain, and finally a legendary warchief. His bloodlust seemed endless, and unfortunately that was the case.Recently I was wandering around Gorgoroth and tracking down an enemy captain. The fight was brutal but eventually his head was separated from his body, and his supporters fled. I was low on health and learned a valuable lesson moments after as my favourite orc decided to betray me.Perhaps it was my fault, I'd aided this orc in all his encounters and made sure he was victorious. I assigned him as a warchief, helped him become legendary, and inadvertently deluded him into thinking he could take on the Bright Lord.His followers were slaughtered, and I regretfully executed the masterpiece I had created. Or did I? Perhaps he survived his fatal injuries like all the other times. If so, I look forward to introducing him to my Drake.;26 March, 2020;
Middle-earth™: Shadow of War™;PolyEsther;NOT INFORMED;252 people found this review helpful98 people found this review funny; Recommended 144.0 hrs on record;"Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. It starts out a little boring, since the only thing to do aside from the main story is killing orcs, but once you reach Act II, the game really picks up, since it allows you to have many interactions with the same orc captains, and form relationships with them.The combat is fluid and fun enough to keep the typical person entertained through Act I, but it's not really what the core of the game is. The core of the game is the Nemesis System. Basically what the Nemesis System does is that when an enemy kills you, they get more powerful, but more than that, they remember that they killed you. Not to mention that your enemies can occasionally cheat death if you kill them, and they'll remember that you killed them, so they'll come back with a figurative axe to grind and a literal axe in their head. I feel like the best aspects of the Nemesis System could best be demonstrated through stories.One of my late-game nemeses was Zoruk Runnybowels. Yes, his name referenced his diarrhea, trust me, he was more intimidating than he sounds. He was the bane of my existence throughout Gorgoroth, but eventually I got together a team of 3 of captains that worked for me, and sent them all to murder Zoruk dead. We succeeded! Then he cheated death almost immediately, and went right back to kicking my ass, except now it was personal for him.He killed me, and that's when I discovered that he had killed me so many times he got promoted to Warchief. I could draw him out in a warchief mission, but instead I continued building my army. I eventually had an army whom's strength I trusted, and we went to capture the fortress. This was where I finally put an end to Zoruk Runnybowels. We captured the first of 4 victory points, guarded by Zoruk, and he began running to protect the next point. I would not allow this.I shadow-strike pulled him back to me, and we participated in a 1v1 battle. I actually even killed some of the grunts who came to help me, because I felt that would be unfair to Zoruk, and I wanted him to know he lost. In a video game. I felt like I had something to prove to an NPC.Since we'd already captured the victory point, no grunts came to help Zoruk either, and I managed to bring him down to zero health. He fell on his knee, and I was prepared for the coming QTE to land the finishing blow, when he started giving a speech. I don't recall exactly what he said here, but I'm just gonna say he quoted Thanos and said ""You should have gone for the head."" He got back up, revealing he had the Death Defying trait, and by now he had adapted to most of my different types of attacks, so he kicked my ass.I tried a second attempt to capture the fortress, and things went similarly at first. We captured the victory point, I got a 1v1 duel with Zoruk, but instead of bringing him down to zero health, once he was broken I grabbed him. Since we were in Gorgoroth, there was a river of lava running right down the streets of the fortress, so I tossed Zoruk into the lava.I went on to capture the fortress, and finally breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Zoruk was finally gone... Until he cheated death again, coming back as Zoruk the Flame of War. But that's a story for another day.";21 December, 2019;

Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr;Beatmaster;NOT INFORMED;469 people found this review helpful130 people found this review funny; Recommended 144.5 hrs on record;Greetings Imperial Citizen, I shall tell you some imperial Truth about Inquisitor Martyr (and it's Expansion Prophecy)First of all citizen, you are looking at a big and long Game, with tons of content, worthy of the Emperor's vast grace.The SP Campaign alone is so big, that you easily will be between Level 60 and 70, if you want to serve the Imperium by doing all Sidequests.The Graphics are nothing World shaking. It fits the WH40k Lore, its dark and gritty. A little bit low res on some places but we are not on a Paradise World / Garden World citizen. This is War. You are constantly moving and purging. No time to pay attention to Details.The Sound is fantastic citizen. The Sound of firing a Bolter or heavy Bolter against the Enemies of Mankind is deafening and truly a perfect representation of the Emperor's Wrath. The Death screams of the Xenos and Heretics dying left and right is purging done right. The Ambient Sounds also helps with the Immersion. The heavy steps of your Inquisitor gives really some weight to his movements. Music also fits but you are more exciting hearing the Bass Sound of a Bolter Round, transforming Xenos into Pinata.There are a lot of Weapons for each Class. My first Playthrough was with a Ranged Inquisitor and his trusty Bolter Towers, which are great to get enemy Aggro. The variety of weapons is remarkable.Las Pistols, Lasguns, Melter, Multimelter, Plasma Pistol, Plasma Rifles, Plasma Cannons, Grav Guns, Grav Cannons, Bolt Pistols, Bolters, Heavy Bolters, Grenade Launchers, Flamer, Heavy Flamer, various Types of Grenades, etc... + Melee Weapons like Thunderhammers, Chainswords, Power Axes and more because sometimes, you want to get close and Personal to purge the Heresy from the Face of the Galaxy.Also you have defensive Items like Void Shields and such. And that was just for one Class. The other Classes get other Weapons and Drops.You can Purge Heretics and Xenos the Way you like citizen. If you want to be a litte heretical yourself, you can go with a Psyker Inquisitor. You will be able to cast lightning and more magic stuff. Usually you would be sentenced to Death by a 5 day Phosphex Bath for being an unsanctioned Psyker, but as long as you are doing your service for the Imperium, it will be postponed until it's over.The other Class is the Assassin Inquisitor, but to me it looks like they are coming from the Vindicare Temple. This is when you want to one hit kill Xenos.And we have the Mechanicus. It's a Summoner Class. You use Bots, Drones and Combat Mechs. A small Army doing the dirty work, while you stay behind collecting the drop. Your Bots do a better Job than those useless Guardsmen.The Gameplay is pretty much like Diablo and any other Hack n Slash...or so it seems for the untrained eye citizen. This game requires Tactic and knowing your Surroundings. You will use cover and run from cover to cover, while going Bolters blazing and using your active skills. Almost all Cover can be destroyed, with sustained fire (depending on the Material and your Weapon). The Xenos and Heretics understand that as well and will use it against you. So be cautious or you will witness a second Istvaan 3 drop site Massacre, if you just stand in the open.The content is as I said: Big. And don't think it's over after the SP Campaign. Oh no citizen. The work and Service for the Imperium extends far beyond than just that. Void Missions, Sector Bar filling Missions, Astropath Missions, DLCs, Warzone, Ordo Missions, cleansing operations, targeting beacon Missions, Tarrot Quests, Arena with infinite Waves (Survival Mode) and PvP. Also more and more Sectors of the Galaxy will be gradually accessible over time (depending on the Devs).Not all is fine and dandy tho. Levels are repetitive and have not a lot of Variety. Missions are more or less the same.Much of the additional content is basically a Gear check or Grind heavy.The Story falls flat.But you are not here for the option to sweet talk to the Enemies of Mankind, you are not here to get your best ancient Relic Items presented to you on a silver plate, you are not here for the plotting, you are here for the PURGING.the Emperor Protects.;6 October, 2020;

Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr;Kalenath;NOT INFORMED;281 people found this review helpful32 people found this review funny; Recommended 1,813.2 hrs on record;This game is far from perfect.It has numerous bugs, glitches, holes in the maps that you fall through and then walk out of. That is leaving aside the random crashes, stuttering and other things that take away from the gameplay.That said...FOR THE EMPEROR!I have played a LOT of Warhammer 40,000 video games. Most of them have ranged from bad to abysmal. (Carnage Champions and Fire Warrior are the absolute bottom of the barrel for me. Look them up if you desire, you will be glad you missed them!) Every so often a game comes along that shines, but for such a niche market as 40K , they are rare. Dawn of War 1 was a good game. Space Marine was a good game. Sanctus Reach and Mechanicus more recently have been good. Most of the rest? If they are playable at all, they are forgettable. The only ones I keep playing are BattleFleet Gothic: Armada because I am a sucker for space combat and this.This is not, in my own opinion, a finished or polished title. Like so many other games these days, it had to ship to recoup costs even with the Founders program. This is a fairly common complaint, especially in older gamers who remember the days of game that came on CD or floppy disk and HAD to be as close to perfect at release to sell at all or the company usually went out of business. Now? Any half baked fool with a computer it seems can make a crummy game in his basement and try to sell it on Steam. This game has numerous problems. The balance (or lack thereof) between melee and ranged combat is high on my pet peeves.But I keep playing.I do not play video games for deep philosophy. I do not play twitch gaming, where milliseconds make or break the game session. I am older than most gamers I know and my reactions are slower. I play games to have fun and guess what? I have fun in this game. It is not exactly true to what I believe an Inquisitor in 40K would do, but hey, that is just my opinion. But that doesn't matter to me. I can fry heretics with warp fire, shoot them with sniper rifles, grenade launchers or any number of other insanely overpowered weapons, or just crunch into them with melee weapons. All shouting praise to the Emperor of Mankind in the darkest hours of the Imperium of Man.That is good enough for me.The Emperor protects!

I can wholeheartedly recommend it. :) In the past it was a love/hate-relationship with Inquisitor-Martyr for me. But I logged over 250 hours in this game and couldn't really stop inpart because I love the WH40K setting. I was very frustated with how the game turned out to be after release. Compared to over games of the genre it lacked severly in all departments of what makes a good arpg and game in general. But thankfully, the devs from Neocore Games didn't abandon Martyr and pushed out the awesome 2.0 update which changed everything for me. -Gameplay/fighting enemies is fun and fluid on my Melee Crusader. Animation speed is superb.-Lootdrops are plenty and I already got some new legendary tier items.-The overhauled crafting system is FINALLY useful.-And the warzone feels better to what we previously got.-Also Voidcrusades are a blast and real lootpinatasetc.etc.I could go on about how I like the game after the Update but I will keep it at that, I suck at writing reviews.

Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr;If;NOT INFORMED;717 people found this review helpful17 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 36.3 hrs on record;"I really wanted to like this game, but there are too many poor design choices to justify a thumbs up.Pros:+ It's Warhammer baby! Lots of cool environments, enemies, and lore.+ Fun for the first 20 hours or so.+ Features Fabulous Bill.Cons:- The majority of missions are basically just a variation of ""kill all enemies"". It gets old FAST. I stopped doing Intel missions and priority missions when I realised they were just overworld missions with slightly better loot.- Loot is boring and often useless. You can easily farm Valorous Heart missions to get great Relic items, making the regular loot you get during the campaign essentially useless. I've lost count of how many times I've gone to Ragna and just clicked every ""Sell All XXXX Items"" button without checking the loot, because it's all usually trash. At some point I stopped seeing item drops as items and just as additional money.- Very confusing, unrewarding and overly convoluted crafting system. Upgrade costs feel way too high for certain upgrades, but hey, it's not like you are using those credits for anything else.- Combat system feels shallow. As a Tech Priest you basically have 4 options. 1) Shoot enemy with your gun. 2) Smack enemy with your axe. 3) Summon constructs that you have little to no control over to attack the enemy for you. 4) Throw a grenade or mine. Since mines are severely overpowered I just ended up chucking them everywhere and killing everything without a second thought. There are a few passive skills you can unlock, but in terms of active skills you are limited to the above options. This makes it very difficult to experiment with new builds or skills.- The skill tree feels too big for the number of skill points you get to distribute, and the individual skills/perks feel lackluster: from level 60 onward leveling takes much longer than before, and it sucks when you then only get one skill point which you can use to give yourself a very minor stat boost (+3% ranged damage, for example). There are some nice skills, but for the most part they require investing too many points into the individual skill trees. - Boss fights are so trivial that they might as well be regular enemies. Due to the already mentioned highly overpowered mines, each boss fight basically consisted of ""chuck three to four sets of mines on the boss. Bam, he's dead"". There is a tone-deaf cutscene where Ragna is shocked and afraid when you encounter an Incubus boss. She warns you that they are extremely dangerous, which is cute because at that point you've likely already defeated many these Incubi with ease. Why is this one so special, Ragna? Where were your words of caution the first 30 times I fought one? Do you even really love me?!- The Knight missions are torture. You can't get any loot or experience from the enemies you kill, and the Knight's movement controls are... something else. Every time Ragna suggested that we use the Knight, I died a little inside. I actually cheered when my tech priest shot her suggestion down during one of the mission. You don't really face any special enemies that justify the use of the Knight - it's just more of the same enemies, just in slightly bigger groups. In all honesty the Knight levels felt like a character nerf - I'm fairly confident that my tech priest mines can do a quicker job of clearing the Knight levels than the Knight can. The Knight's weapons are also a bit weird, and you can't really get the sense of sowing pure carnage with the available skills. It's basically an auto firing boltgun that does pathetic amounts of damage, a laser beam that fries everything it touches. a single target, high damage shot. a weaker explosive shot that does AoE in a minuscule area. and a weak front-facing shield... None of the skills made me feel like I could unleash the full wrath and glory of the God King Emperor of Mankind on the mutant, the heretic, or the alien. Where's the massive power sword that I can use to cleave through the enemy masses? Where's the massive explosions? The Knight feels more like a child's wind-up walker toy than a divine instrument of war.- NPCs can just as well be UI interfaces. They don't really have any dialogue or interaction options - you just use them to access the relevant game menu or to get new quests. - The in-game clues you get from the servants of chaos look like they were written by a preschooler. I chuckled at how grimderp and edgy they look. Even the font looks evil.- What is the point of the alignment system for the different map sectors? I didn't see this influence my game once, except to prevent me from using certain Tarot cards. On the same note, the Radical vs Puritan path choices and rewards are a joke and will have almost zero impact on your playthrough.- I unlocked a skill tree for the tech priest by killing 5000 enemies with melee attacks, but I can't find the unlocked skill tree anywhere.";27 September, 2023;

Total War: WARHAMMER - The King and the Warlord;Smug;NOT INFORMED;1 person found this review helpful; Not Recommended 7.8 hrs on record;I've played a few Total War games before, the addition of monsters and magic is pretty cool and Warhammer is an endlessly intriguing setting. However I'm not too sure about the emphasis on lords as generals, mages are still very fragile and should stay away as moral support, but if they're combat oriented then they will take minutes for a moshpit to wear down. Not bad if you want to run a wrecking ball into their frontline with your infantry or unlock their monster mount, but it makes things harder to focus down their generals for a fast morale drain. More importantly, I feel I'm always fighting up hill when I start a campaign here. Rome and Medieval generally give you an appetizer rebel province to expand to, something that distracts each major faction while they build up to the mid game. They do set aside smaller factions to take but they're also playing by major faction rules, they develop units as fast as you and will quickly get a 20/20 stack to defend a province. Rebels and minor savage tribes turn into their own obstacles that need more planning or another army to reliably take. This is besides the AI sometimes having one faction snowball into a threat you need to deal with, hopefully your faction leader didn't lose a fight and needs 4 turns to come back, all time wasted recruiting and running the economy through a minor lord. When you get a big army and run it well it feels great but there are rarely and opportunities to run smaller skirmishes when any lose can make large swings and everyone is recruiting 3 at a time like they don't have any economy to worry about.I have heard a lot of problems get fixed in later parts and this feels more like an add on for some Old World factions, but people still complain about features in the new games not getting patched fast enough and they still haven't added the quality of life features to this one, and I can't imagine the experience is much different in how fast the computer factions expand or pick the wars you fight. For some all they every want is to build a horde of peasants and research up to the better units, but I feel there's a lot more flexibility in previous games or at least an understanding who is meant to take over large swaths of land in the opening tunrs.; 10 June;

Zombie Army 4: Dead War;Colonel;NOT INFORMED;1,184 people found this review helpful15 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 34.1 hrs on record;"EDIT: As of March 2022, the Season 1 pass is free, so you can feel free to keep that in mind.Despite giving this game a thumbs down, I actually recommend playing it. My thumbs down is simply to highlight and grab attention at what is a growing trend in scummy business practices by game developers and publishers.Zombie Army 4 is a pretty great game as far graphics, game play and technical merits is concerned. The problem is the downright, ridiculous way that Rebellion has decided to price this game. Let's put aside the one year exclusivity deal with Epic because developers need to take the best deal they can get to maximize returns on development, so as much as I dislike Epic, I can't fault Rebellion for wanting to make the most money they could. That is how all businesses operate and it is what it is. The major problem is the absolute nickel and dime pricing structure they've come up with. You can't simply buy the base game and have an equal experience to the previous Zombie Army games. Buying the base game gets you the base campaign, four characters and three guns for each weapons category. THREE!!!! This means you have three rifles to choose from, three secondary weapons (Technically, there are four secondary weapons, but the Thompson and STG are so similar feeling, I have a hard time counting them as two weapons) and three pistols for a total of nine weapons. In a game that was an offshoot of the SNIPER series, you know, a game where you SNIPE enemies with rifles and get to see awesome kills, you get a whopping THREE rifles to choose from! Unless, of course, you buy the Super Deluxe edition or you bought the base game and later on, shell out $35 dollars for one or both of the season passes ($70 for both). Or... you can buy guns individually for a few bucks a piece... And that's just the start of it, individual characters, clothing packs, weapons skins and levels can all be purchased by themselves. Seriously, go and look at the DLC options for this game and it will make your head spin. I have no problem with developers selling a season pass or DLC that's actually worth something, but breaking up all of this content to such a ridiculous degree is the most asinine thing I have ever seen! This game looks like it's trying to rival something like Fortnite with the amount of crap they want you to buy. Again, DLC is fine, season passes that make sense are fine, but this was just the messiest and most headache-inducing way to release content. It makes me angry that they would go and do this. It makes me feel like Rebellion thinks their fans are dumb and are just going to gobble up any garbage they throw out. I bought the base game at a discount price on Greenman Gaming and I didn't mind spending that, but it's unfortunate that I won't be able to experience the other levels or even the guns, for that matter, until I see a major sale. In the end, this lack of content in the base game leads to boredom much faster than it otherwise would. It gets VERY repetitive only having three rifles to choose from. In the previous games, I'd usually play for a level with one rifle and then switch it up on the next. Well, if you like doing that, after three levels, you've experienced all of the rifles there are. And that goes for the secondary weapons, too. You get three... and then you're back to repeating them again. This lack of variety turns, what should be a very fun game, into a rather dull drag. Unless, of course, you want to shell out an extra $70+ dollars or Lord knows how much for all of the additional micro-transaction garbage.Difficulty balance is also an issue in the harder modes, at least for single player, which I enjoy. I beat the game on normal, which was fine, as you'd expect. I decided to go back through again on the hardest difficulty (Brutal). Despite having my rifles upgraded all of the way in damage and most other attributes, basic zombies can, sometimes, take 3-4 headshots to die. That is pretty ridiculous. You'll often find yourself running out of ammo because zombies won't die from even several headshots and you're left running around trying to scavenge what little ammo zombies might drop (it isn't much) or looking for an ammo box which aren't always placed where you need them. This is a minor nitpick, of course, because the hardest difficulty is meant to be hard! But, I think it's a little silly that I can put 3-4 bullets straight into a normal zombie's forehead and they just keep shuffling toward me and scratching my health away. What's the point in maxing out gun attributes when it doesn't really help? It's actually a weird choice in balance. When you max out guns and you're playing on 'normal' difficulty, you can steamroll right over almost anything. But, play the game on 'Brutal' and it's like your guns are useless. At least, as far as the guns in the base edition are concerned. With all that said, this is still a very fun game. The visuals look terrific. It runs very smoothly for me. I only experienced a couple of crashes and it was at the same point in the game with DX12. I switched to Vulcan and was able to proceed just fine and later, switched back to DX12 with no further problems. The base campaign is quite lengthy. That is one area I will give it to Rebellion. There are a lot of levels and areas to fight through, so big A+ in that respect. If you're a fan of the series, you'll still enjoy the experience, especially if playing with friends. However, the lack of guns in the base game is so slimy in my opinion, especially in a game that's focused on shooting things. If you want to sell additional levels, skins or a few special weapons, I'd see no problem with that, but locking the bulk of guns that fans have had access to in all of the previous games behind additional paywalls was just an awful decision. Let me be clear, offering a ton of worthy DLC wouldn't have been offensive, but locking basic weapons behind season passes or a ton of little micro-transactions is the big issue here. The base game gets a 7/10 from me. The story was good enough for this type of game and the Zombie Army lore, the visuals are fantastic, the controls and mechanics feel so satisfying and 99% of the time, it ran like a dream. I'm running an 8700k and a 1080ti and I ran the entire game at native 4k with everything turned all of the way up, except I leave AA off. The game rarely dipped below 100fps for me. Absolutely a joy in optimization as far as I'm concerned. If they had just given access to all of the normal weapons which should have been included, my score would've definitely been higher. I give Rebellion's pricing structure and business practices a generous 2/10. If they do this in their future zombie titles, I'll be skipping them all together or looking for other ways to play them.Please see my edit - EDIT: Let me just add this to my review as well since I'm just now realizing this. Steam/Rebellion doesn't really make it super-clear what content comes with what edition as well as the season passes. If you are a person who wants all of the content. You can get it by purchasing the Super Deluxe Edition along with Season Pass 2. That will give you, essentially everything. However, if you view all of the additional content and choose the ""Add all DLC to cart"" at the bottom, Steam will allow you to purchase it all which works out to over $200. You will be purchasing the Super Deluxe Edition, both season passes as well as all of the individual micro-transaction garbage. Which means, you'll be buying the same content twice when you don't need to and Steam will not warn you or stop you. This is extremely troubling. This might be more Steam's fault than anything. However, this should be something Rebellion should've addressed with Steam as to not allow someone to make this mistake. If you want all of the content, purchase the Super Deluxe Edition and Season Pass 2. DO NOT add all DLC content to your cart and purchase that way.";30 March, 2021;

Zombie Army 4: Dead War;Acidmeadow;357 products in account;267 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 3.8 hrs on record;Look. We need to actually have a seriously frank discussion about the DLC here, because after playing the game for a small amount of time and deeply enjoying myself and the many vast improvements this game has over ZAT, I've noticed that so much, so much stuff, is locked behind a paywall. You cannot play this game and not know this, at all. It hits you immediately. This is not going to be a review about the game, as I'll just tell you that the game is ??????? fantastic, there's so very little wrong with it. But this serves as a critique of Rebellion's business practices when it comes to this game. You cannot even talk about this game without interacting with these notions.So after all this time, locked away on Epic Games Store, Zombie Army IV: Dead War comes to Steam and I immediately pounced on it when it did because I. Love. Zombie Army Trilogy. That game's incredible, definitely go buy it if you have the time. It's got some jank that takes some getting used to, but it's definitely manageable, it's definitely worth playing. And above all, it's a full game. No BS, no DLC, it's a full game.This game takes ZAT, puts it on steroids, takes it off life support, polishes everything, takes the jank out of the jankiness that was in ZAT, improves on so much... and then completely, utterly ????? you with downloadable content. I mean it royally, gravely ????? us. EIGHTY-TWO (82) PIECES OF DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT can be yours presently for $406.20 as of the time of this writing, right now. So this game puts so much effort into uplifting Zombie Army as a series, updating the visuals, fantastically reanimating the zombies so they're not jerky, they move fluidly and naturally, every shot is now at the mercy of your skill (or lack thereof), and the environments, the graphics, the sound design, they're all there, right there, and this game is then made almost near-perfect by Rebellion's CLEARLY well-honed effort, they've clearly put some love into this, put their hearts into innovating Zombie Army's gameplay and pushing it forward with everything Zombie Army used to lack......And then they lobotomize it. They take content that could have been left into the game, maybe as a means of incentivizing getting good at the game, skilling up and achieving specific goals, and they make you pay for it instead. They took a whole game, threw it on the ground, and are selling a wonderful game piece, by piece, by piece.The people who developed this game, made so many game-changing improvements on just how you even play the game, have themselves utterly and shamelessly crippled their own wonderful production with extremely intensive greed. Rebellion. You're not some AAA-tier gaming company, by far. And even if you were, these practices are never okay. Your greed is even less unearned than the greed of companies like EA, companies like Activision. What in the Hell have you done, from Zombie Army III to Zombie Army IV, that warrants this kind of shameless greedy behavior?I'll be the first to admit, from ZAT to here, they put in some ????????? work. They changed the game, definitely, they improved on the series most definitely. But it's not worth $406.20, not even counting the initial transaction it takes to even play the game to find out that it is completely broken by shameless avariciousness. What in burning Hell are you people doing? You didn't even give the Left 4 Dead survivors any of their own voices, or even modability to the game itself. You did well, but you sure as ???? are not getting almost half a ??????? grand for me to play the rest of this game.I've already said it. The game is ??????? great. There's hardly a thing wrong with it.But I can't recommend that others spend their money on such a shameless, uncontrollably greedy company that has this kind of behavior waiting for them. It's made even worse because Rebellion actually used to be a humble company. They knew what they had, they did the best the could with what little resources they did have and made some great, engaging games (the Sniper Elite series, Zombie Army Trilogy, etc.). Now they're suddenly acting like Electronic Arts or ??????? Activision.To Rebellion themselves: This is why piracy exists. It levels the playing field against money-hungry scum who put their profit motive over their customers in cases where it's warranted (or more disagreeably, whenever people really want). I'm not saying it's always justified, in fact nine times out of ten I frown upon it deeply. But, you nickle and you dime people, even your own loyal consumers who have known you forever aren't going to shill for you and that's me in this case. You made a great product, you intentionally broke it so you could sell the pieces back to us. You're ?????? in the head.You make a great case for it.Update, 26 October 2021Still one for ever-rising greed, Rebellion has officially lifted the complete game's total to a brand new 422.15, inching ever closer to half a grand in downloadable content.Anybody want to place bets as to whether or not they make it half a grand?

You only get 3 primary, secondary, and sidearm. That's extremely pathetic for a full priced game on top of the previous games not having this lack of content-Base game weapons' form of progression is finding collectibles called Upgrade kits and finishing stickers (which are challenges) but even if you finish all challenges and finding all kits, you won't have enough to fully upgrade all the base game weapons unless you level up to 100. This is fine but the DLC weapons have ACTUAL WEAPON PROGRESSION as in each upgrade requires you to do something rather than chase after collectibles. For a game that boasts DEEP PROGRESSION, why give that to DLC weapons and instead also give it to the base game weapons? I dont understand this direction-Game playerbase is minimal due to the issues listed above, but the biggest flaw is that you cannot play with people that have DLCs that you dont and vice versa, leading to alienation of an already small playerbase. The whole game is built as if the main game is F2P, but no it was launched at full price of $60 dollars with over 200 dollars worth of DLC. I got this game and the DLCs at a sale and it was $87 dollars. Was it worth it? Game is fun, but not $87 dollars fun. Wait for a bigger sale or wait for Rebellion to stop acting like greedy moronsEdit: They just made all Season 1 content free. Not the right move, make the main game free, not the DLC. And it's funny how this means there is a chance other season pass content will be free, screwing over anyone that paid the absurd prices for these DLCs AND incentives people into just waiting for them to become free instead of buying them.

Virginia;liked;NOT INFORMED;107 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 5.9 hrs on record;My initial thought was that Virginia should be considered a walking simulator but while these games give the freedom to explore in Virginia things often happen on their own and our job will be to interact with the objects near us. When we are allowed to walk we can only do so for a short distance, in fact, often the game cuts to a new scene just as we are walking along a corridor. This may bother some players, however, these cuts are usually in line with how the music changes - a new scene is introduced just as the music intensifies, for instance.But what is Virginia? It is a story of an FBI agent who is tasked with the investigation of a colleague. While making sure Maria is unaware of the dossier the agency has on her we are trying to uncover the mysteries behind a missing person, all this in the course of 6 days (Monday-Saturday). As we make progress the days are getting more and more difficult and we find it next to impossible to differentiate between real life and dreamline sequences. As Anne (our heroine) is getting attached to Maria she finds it even more challenging to keep spying on her.I checked some reviews just after completing the game and noticed several players comparing the game's atmosphere to Twin Peaks or simply referring to the creator of mentioned TV show, David Lynch. I often find that David's works do not make much sense (they are simply too symbolic and are up for interpretation always) but this is not to say it is a bad comparison. I just think that when it comes to Virginia subsequent playthroughs help us understand the story much better.So, here we are accompanying Anne for one of her workweeks during which nobody utters a single word. Nobody says anything - it's all about gestures, actions and a mesmerising soundtrack that alone should convince you to see the story through even if you do not find it captivating at first glance. Virginia is a 2-hour long controversial journey that you will either hate at the end or you'll immediately jump in for a 2nd ride.;20 February, 2018;

It's worth it to at least watch a stream if you're into this kind of story.As a gamer, and as someone who loves ""walking sims"" and artistic games, there is no reason that this should have been told as a game instead of movie. You have no agency, there is no sense of exploration, you can't affect any outcome, and you never have any option to choose. You pretty much walk through a series of very linear levels with usually only one object to interact with at any given time.Virginia is an interactive experience the same way that turning pages in a book is an interactive experience.Watch a stream if you're interested, because you are missing out on nothing by watching instead of playing this game.";26 September, 2016;

I like that the developers are using the game space to explore outside the box, and I think that exploration was extremely successful. It's a hard thing to talk about withotu spoiling, so I'll just say that what they've put together is beautiful, compelling, and empathic.I'm a sucker for novel experiences even if they're not focused on gameplay, so this worked for me.

Virginia;Feena;2,838 products in account;77 people found this review helpful; Recommended 3.2 hrs on record;First of all, I've experienced a very bad motion sickness from this game. The camera movement is really bad, and sadly you can't fix it or disable it, however, the story of this game made me play it until the end. I enjoyed every part of it.The story started with the new graduate FBI agent Anne Tarver who was assigned to investigate a missing young teenager with her partner Maria Halperin, but this investigation took a bad turn as she, in fact, was asked to investigate and keep an eye on her colleague and pretend to be a partner. I'm not going to spoil the story, but it is basically about corruption in all of its different forms. I loved how the story slowly unfolded, it felt like watching a movie, a good one if I had to add, especially with the Orchestral soundtracks which I didn't hesitate to purchase.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1368774986Since the game is a walking simulator, you are limited with what you can do. You'll control Anna with WASD and interact with some of the objects around with the mouse. It is a story driven game, it can be confusing at first as they jump from a scene to another, but later you'll get the hang of it and enjoy those 41 chapters, yes, they do have 41 chapters when you check the chapters select section, but the duration of the game is six days. I liked that the game is wordless, you'll understand the story from the actions alone. Many people were confused and I don't blame them.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1368773851The achievements of the game are quite challenging in my opinion but there are good guides on steam to help you through them, I didn't use a guide in my first playthrough, but I will in the second. There are two different types of collectibles, the feathers, and flowers. There is no map in the game, you can't choose where to go but you can choose a specific chapter from the chapter select menu, I'm not sure if this will work with the collectibles, doubt it will. I was surprised and sad that this game is based on the real story as they mentioned at the beginning of the game. To think that our world is filled with corrupted people. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1368774323Pros:+Amazing orchestral soundtracks.+Nice cinematic graphics.+Interesting story ended nicely.+Collectibles. +Steam achievements. (A little bit challenging)Cons:-Short game.-No map.-Camera movement cause motion sickness.If only I didn't suffer from motion sickness during my gameplay, I'd have played this game again to earn the rest of the achievements. I might do it though, one day with lots of breaks in between. I do recommend this game, I'd have highly recommended it if there was a way to fix the motion sickness issue which I found many people been experiencing it in the discussion board. I hope to see more games like this from the developer, they really did a great job.?????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????? ???? ?????????????? ???????? ??????????'?? ????????????;7 May, 2018;

I like Twin Peaks, I like Fargo, and I liked the little letter from the developers in the main menu that made the game feel more personal and ""indie"". I tried to force myself to enjoy it, but by around the halfway point I realized that it was never going to start getting fun.First off, if you're sensitive to low FOV you should just stop reading now because this game will be a headache-inducing vomit comet because of how low it goes, combined with the game's insistence that you play it at 30 FPS (though it does allow you to break that limit if you choose to). But beyond that, there's not much to say about the gameplay because it's not even really a walking simulator because that would mean you were able to walk through most of it. About half of the game is just being sat in one place and having no controls except looking around and occasionally clicking on a thing or two, and you get so used to it that when you finally get to a point where you're actually expected to walk around it sometimes takes a few moments to realize that you aren't chained in place anymore. The game makes itself out to be some sort of mystery game in the description, but you don't do any actual mystery solving, or really much of anything except walking and then getting abruptly carted off to the next setpiece before you can figure out what's going on. They bring up Fargo and Twin Peaks as inspirations, but a significant part of why those series are so beloved is because of the characters, and more importantly, their writing and dialogue. So of naturally when making Virginia, the obvious choice was to make a game completely devoid of any dialogue at all. The actual small-town mystery takes up about a third of the 2 hours it'll probably take you to finish it, and the rest of that is a jumbled series of is-it-a-dream-or-not-ooooooh sequences that seem to just serve to make the game seem deeper and more arbitrarily confusing. I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not very good. Even for a ""walking simulator"" type game there's just not enough substance for me to really recommend it to anyone. It's like Gravity Bone (or Thirty Flights of Loving more specifically, but I thought TFoL was worse than Gravity Bone) except several times longer and several times less interesting. But at least the soundtrack was good. As a hot tip if you do buy the game, be sure to turn on the subtitles. There's no dialogue, so everything is just [sips coffee] or [unusual noises abruptly stop] and it's kind of hilarious, which gives you at least some entertainment.";23 September, 2016;

Virginia;Velvetique;1,351 products in account;40 people found this review helpful; Not Recommended 1.6 hrs on record;This is a game that will either infuriate you, or tickle all the right spots in your head. For me, it was more infuriating.I went in with a completely open mind, and I have enjoyed plenty of 'walking simulator' games like Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable, Layers of Fear, The Beginner's Guide, and Kholat. The trick to a good walking simulator is being able to offer an experience that wouldn't be as strong without the ability to explore and observe on your own terms. The problem with Virginia is that it does not really present a narrative that benefits from this kind of experience.It's a beautiful game with an incredible score, and the ability they had to communicate some complex ideas with no dialogue and minimal text was great, and the game starts out fairly strong in this sense, but the game often hinders and prevents you from exploring enough that in the moments it WANTS you to explore and observe, you're going to think that you aren't supposed to. They have details and story elements that you come across if you explore and observe, but at many points throughout the game before these, I would attempt to explore and observe a location only for it to jumpcut to a new place entirely before I could get a good look. So, in a game that wants you to explore and observe, it holds you back from doing so in most situations. Rather than letting the player have the time they need to get their fill and move on with the story beats, it just cuts and moves on like a film, which it DESPERATELY wants to be a movie. Its design and execution is completely at odds with the experience it's trying to present to you.This isn't really even getting into the plot either, which is mostly well done up until the last act where it delves too hard into trying to be trippy and confusing to work. There's nothing wrong with doing more experimental or trippy presentations or non linear story delivery, and it clearly takes a lot of cues from filmmakers who specialize in that style like David Lynch. However, for as much as it tries to replicate that style, it does not present enough coherency to make it fun to be confused. What I mean is, there's enough going in Twin Peaks that even when it gets weird and confusing, you're still kind of along for the ride, you still sorta get where you're at even if the web that centers the show is getting more tangled and otherwordly. I didn't really get that feeling from Virginia, it felt more like a mess of events and scenes that don't really have a plan in mind other than being confusing and weird, and not in a way that's charming or engaging.I can get why some people probably like it, and I can see why it might get something like a BAFTA. But for me, all the things it did that were impressive and interesting get undone and torn apart by the end of the experience. I don't really think it works as a whole piece, though I appreciate the venture and risks the game took.;15 May, 2018;
Virginia;Rabbit;NOT INFORMED;94 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 1.6 hrs on record;"When a game is as beautiful and full of potential as Virginia is, it's difficult to admit that its flaws outweigh its better aspects. I wanted to like this game, but I feel like I'd be lying if I were to recommend it. The art and music work well together to fashion a stunning world from an aesthetic standpoint, but upon closer inspection that world falls apart. The lack of interactivity in the environments are more reminiscent than a sparse model home than the life-filled spaces of Gone Home or Firewatch. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the same charm of other ""walking simulators"" to carry it. The game's soundtrack is ambitious, but inadequately implemented (more on this in a moment). The game's scenes are jarringly short, which ends up as a bit of a paradox, as the game's pacing makes it feel like one long scene rather than a fulfilling narrative. At the length of a fairly short movie by today's standards, Virginia still dragged. The soundtrack tries to match the game's pacing, and succeeds for some of the quieter moments, but the tense scenes feel too thinly stretched, going on for far too long for the music's urgency to have the same impact. From a gameplay standpoint, there isn't exactly much to talk about. Your control over the main character is criminally shallow, leaving a unsatisfying disconnect. Often in environments there's only one thing to interact with, and there's no feeling of exploration when you're being railroaded through the story with even less agency than similar titles. It's difficult to call Virginia a ""walking simulator"" when you aren't even doing much of that, but ""clicking simulator"" sounds too close to point-and-click adventures, so I suppose I must settle for ""watching simulator."" This brings an issue to mind: I'd much rather be watching this story as a movie than playing it as a game, especially given how little gameplay there actually is. Were this an animated film, perhaps it would have faired better, but as a game--even as a narrative experience--it's sorely lacking in giving any sense of fulfillment. Much of the unfulfilled feeling this game leaves lies in the story. Now, I'm not dead set on narratives requiring traditional structures, and I love movies that incorporate strong visual storytelling (Upstream Color comes to mind), but Virginia's narrative has an indirectness that leads to confusion rather than good old fashioned min????ery. The developers did, indeed, set out to make a confusing game, but rather than being a complex mystery Virginia ends up as a scattered, unfocused, vague mess. Trust me, I got the major points of the story. It isn't that hard to piece together. However, what the game presents is, again, unsatisfying. I believe a lot of this is due to the lack of voice acting. While the NPCs were characterized well, Anne herself feels criminally shallow for the weight attributed to her story. The player doesn't identify with her because her motivation's don't align with ours in the slightest. Were there some narration, perhaps this wouldn't have been so jarring, but as it stands this alienation doesn't add anything to the game. I feel like this game could have been more. Had the player been given more agency, there would have been a better connection to the story rather than the unshakable feeling of being an outsider. The visual style doesn't make up for the lifeless environments, and the music is largely hit or miss, with more of the latter in the long run. The story felt rushed and the pacing dragged, and the game's world isn't fleshed out enough to feel its own.To sum it up in a word, Virginia was unsatisfying. Perhaps I'm missing the point. But perhaps the game just needs to make its point better.";26 September, 2016;

I also really enjoyed the multi-build mechanic too as well as just enjoyed exploring the hub-worlds and finding all the secrets. Plus there’s a level where you just fly around as the Death Star II and Starkiller Base and just blow up planets like crazy. Really fun!The biggest problem with this game is how much filler material there is. There are so many levels and characters and vehicles that are trying to stretch the game out as long as possible, and that’s either boring or confusing. They’re trying to make a game from 1 movie, and that’s not a lot of source material to work with. I think the devs did a good job overall though making the gameplay fun while staying close to the movie. I can’t think of another movie as suitable for a full Lego game, to be honest.It’s a very average Lego game in the sense that it’s not bad but also not fantastic - it’s just, average. I’d say buy it when it’s on sale. Overall though it’s fun enough, played it with the boys, played it with tha girl, recommend no matter who you're trying to peg that night, it's gunna be a good time.Finally, I got nothing against Kylo but damn Rey is so boring.7/10 Minikits; 13 June;

Espacially since the level layout does not change each time you play the same mission again, however the monsters and items do. And each different mission can have a different objective for you to complete (which also brings some varity to them), so you always need to adapt to the current situation.ProgressionThere currently is no progression in the game, other than completing missions successfully and unlocking the next tier of missions, but even those will likely be wiped once a new set of missions (known as a ""rundown"") will release periodically every few weeks which will keep the game fresh and competetive. However, I kind of like that there is no superficial account progression in the game. I always think account progression is artificially extending the life of the game by having you unlock features sequentially. And the current range of selectable weapons and utility tools are small enough to not feel overwhelmed at this point anyways, so I definitly like that everything is unlocked right from the start and you can try out everything and see what fits your playstyle.Weapons and LoadoutsOn the start of each mission you can select one primary and one secondary weapon as well as an utility tool (bio-radar-tracker, deployable-mines, sentry turrets, foam-launcher) and a skin for your melee hammer weapon. The list of weapons are standard (SMG, DMR, Pistols, Shotguns, Sniper) and what you would expect from a shooter, however from what I gathered from the lore, the weapons themselves are not ment to be any elite equipment. Which is why they dont feel very powerful against the monsters. And by design, you are not supposed to feel powerful!Horror Elements and LoreIn general, the genre ""horror"" is very broad, so be aware that the horror aspects of this game mainly come from the grotesque monsters and the fact that you - as prisoners, no elite squad - are basically send completely under-equipped on a suicide mission far down into an abandoned underground facility. There are no jumpscares or complex horror scenarios. It is just that you are basically doomed to die and the only way to live another day is to do the task the mysterious Warden entity wants you to do. It's that help- and hopelessness that makes this game to be classified as ""horror"". If you make one mistake, monsters will swarm you and you might be done for.GunplayBut you still have your guns to help with the monsters. Even if you wake them up you can make it out alive with some good aim. However, spraying and praying is not adviced. Most weapons feel weak however thats only because they require you to aim for the enemy weakspots to be effective. Blasting a full magazin randomly into a horde of monsters is not. Therefore, if you are a great shot, then you can easily and quickly take out a group of monsters on your own. The fact that you can hit enemies running at you to stagger them helps with that.Nevertheless, it is always an option to clear an entire room with gunfire. Sometimes you even want to do that! For example when you are dealing with a scout which summons an additional wave of monsters you simply take him out and shoot the remaining.Missing Matchmaking and Ingame-Voice-ChatThere currently is not matchmaking in the game. You can create lobbies and invite players from your Steam friend list or invite them by sending them an invite code generated for your lobby. The devs provide Discord channels to search for groups. Furthermore, there is no Voice-Chat Ingame, so I currently would recommend Discord for both Group Search and Voice Coms, because you definitely need at least three players (because the game is balanced around four, no matter how many players start a mission) and need to communicate with your mates. Overall, I dont think this is a big issue, because I dont see myself having a lot of fun when playing with new complete strangers each and every time. This game is best played with people you like playing with and you know you can lose with. And if you always play in the same group, then you will create your own group dynamic and strategies which I find very interesting and rewarding and where I think the main long-term satisfaction of this game comes from.ConclusionI recommend this game to anyone in for a challenge, who likes to play slow and methodically and who does not give up even after dozens of failed missions in a row. As long as you take something out of every mission for next time and you and your teammates are willing to cooperate, you will have a lot of intense and satisfying moments in this game. And I definitly think that playing in a group of at least three, idealy four, with people you know or play a lot with helps having fun and succeeding in this game.However, I do wonder for how long the stealth hit-them-with-the-hammer gameplay can hold up. Time will tell! For now we can only look forward to planned content based on the roadmap and hope that they add more depth to the monsters and stealth mechanics to keep the game fresh.With ~3-6 hours of gametime for each mission (depending on how well you do, adaptable and experienced you are) I think this game is worth its asking price (there currently are 6 missions in the first rundown). Espacially since it seem that all missions will be hand crafted and will release on a regular basis.";12 December, 2019;

GTFO;SN;NOT INFORMED;513 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 306.0 hrs on record;No item/level grinding required to actually play the game as it was meant to be. No pointless difficulty options, instead there are easier levels and harder levels. Everyone is on the same playing field. Refreshing coming from other co-op games and their bloat.There's a lot of content with the 7 (soon to be 8) rundowns, totalling ~70 levels. While each level can be hit or miss in their enjoyment, the highs are very high and the lows are acceptable. Once I figured out what the game was going to be like part way into Alt Rundown 1&2 the game clicked. The act of learning became an enjoyable process until the levels themselves became the highlight, with some really fun tests of individual and team skill later on. The game is a shooter foremost, with stealth sections as a side note. Later missions make this clear but the earliest ones tricked me and my team into thinking taking 30 minutes to stealth clear a few zones with spears was OK. It's not, it's boring and it doesn't work later on. The levels have time pressure scenarios thrown in now and then, with some understanding of fast stealth being a critical skill. And in the end, most rooms in most levels can be awaken and shot as long as shots connect and resources are collected. It's not a 'count your shots' type of game, despite it having that aesthetic.One downside: The game is super opaque in almost all of its systems. Stealth mechanics, enemy spawning mechanics during alarms, weapon/tool stats and their use cases are all things that are worth looking up. While most levels can be played blind without encountering something seriously unexpected (with proper terminal usage and planning), occasionally a level will throw a curveball that you couldn't possibly know or prepare for, sometimes ending the run. This and the fact that you get a few words worth of hints in a mission description to try and guess the theme of the level (usually resulting in a suboptimal team loadout) means the game isn't very blind run friendly. Clearing levels may rely on scouting runs to gain knowledge when starting out, less so when more experienced.Game is good with 2-4 players despite enemy/objective count not scaling down. Some levels feel bad with 2 players due to mission design assuming 4 players, but all are doable with and without bots. Bots are borderline infuriating to play with but will greatly assist a 2-3 player team regardless. Solo, with and without bots, is not a good experience.;5 December, 2023;

Walk away. Sorry. This game is nearly impossible, even with four good players who know what they're doing. Going solo should be treated by mental health professionals as a form of self-harm. This is a gritty, dark, hopeless world, and you are gritty, dark, hopeless chumps, being thrown at gritty, dark, monstrous enemies that will inevitably tear you limb from limb unless you use your gritty, dark, overpowered guns to melt their faces off. The first phase of most missions consists of sneaking about, gathering supplies, and locating the objective. The second Phase consists... mostly, or getting killed in one of three ways, learning how the mission plays, and trying it again. What three ways, you ask?1: You will get torn limb from limb by hordes of ravenous zombie-like creatures that want to **** you in the face with their Tentacle tongues and **** down your neck. 2: You will get fragged by a team-mate or their turret. 3: You will run out of ammo. Refer back to 1 for what happens then. This game requires patience, coordination, communication, and trust. That means you will die alot, and blame one of your friends for getting you face-****ed by the horde. Unless it's your fault, which it will be 25% of the time. Eventually every mission comes to point where you all agree it's time to GET THE **** OUT OF HERE (Ahp.. they said the name... thee it is), and you have to run through the confusing maze of the level you just crept through. If you, like me, have the sense of direction of a syphilitic hamster dying of a brain-swell.... then this may pose a difficult task.

Their average lifespan was around 60 years, but they made every year count. They were obsessed with technology, already building their first robots before they had even left their world. Unfortunately, they were immediately boxed in by empires that had emerged into FTL travel far before they had. Their dreams of expanding into distant worlds was immediately and brutally crushed, after their first colony was bombarded into oblivion during in an ill-fated first-contact. Instead of expanding into planets, my people instead built habitats around dead worlds, watching with envious eyes as their hyper-religious neighbours claimed lush, verdant planets. They waiting, watching their old sicken and die, wracked by disease and genetic weakness, while the incredibly long-lived religious neighbours often made it to ages such as 110. Their neigbours scoffed, those Emperors of the Divine. They knew those foolishly materialistic birds could not possibly understand their true purpose in the unvierse. God was on the side of those who hated materialists, after all. Humiliation after humilitation followed, where my people were used in foreign wars, had their new colonies taken away from them, brave colonists literally eaten as delicacies in certain worlds. The bird's hearts gradually hardened, and they began to view aliens with the contempt they so richly deserved. The hatred grew, and the people grew stronger from it. One day, a neighbouring empire, a race of disgusting fungoids, had their fleet annihilated in a short-lived war with an impossibly-powerful ancient empire. Quickly taking advantage of their weakened status, my people quickly turned them into tributaries. The bounty of materials allowed a new phase of expansion for my people, and we colonized 3 new planets. Suddenly, they had become a Great Power in their local area. The religious kings nearby, now the undisputed superpower of the galaxy, continued to ignore them. After all, they were but a gnat in comparison to the territorial holdings of the great Empire. They were soon proven wrong, as in a few short years a massive construction of habitats was implemented across my people's nation. Billions of souls now rested in space, enough to even match the population and might of the Divine Empire. My people continued to advance, their knowledge of cybernetics second to none. Soon, they had a breakthrough: implants could increase their efficiency to the point where they would become the superpower. After a brief teething period, it was done. Every man, woman and child was equipped with the implants. The Divine Empire was horrified, quickly declaring an unprovoked war. But this was not the same bird people as before. Now, their vengeance was at hand. They crushed the forces of the False Emperor, casting him down, and taking his holdings for themselves. The long-lived creatures were quickly enslaved, forced to watch their once great empire collpasing into feuding chiefdoms. Soon, the bird race began to challenge even the ancient empires, building Ringworlds, Dyson Spheres, and even an sensory array that let them see the entire galaxy. Furthermore, they discovered a way to store their minds into an immortal body of steel. This would not stand, the ancient empires decided, immediately declaring war on the innocent birds. Once again, they were quickly crushed, thousand-year old empires grinded into the dust of history. Now, there were only the birds, mechanical gods of the galaxy, encased in empty, undying shells. Every other race was dead, killed in revenge for their cruelty, and their arrogance. A foreign invader came, a biological hivemind from another galaxy. They too, were quickly crushed, and their worlds burned into ashes. The gods built a ringworld at the centre of the galaxy, to remind those fledgling races, just coming into space travel, of the folly of those who came before, then retreated back the edge of the galaxy, content to explore the mysteries of the universe within their massive ringworlds. Time would only tell if the newer races will make the same mistake. tl.dr: Get this game, the stories you create will make you addicted. Please send help.;23 August, 2017;

My territory was overrun, defenses were wiped out, and my allies began to fracture. But I held on. Planet after planet was wiped out but I held onto my core, building up the mother of all fleets. I lost upwards of 80% of my territory and my stockpiles of resources were nearly exhausted, but I sent forth my fleet in a last glorious charge against inevitability. I cut through tens of thousands of Unbidden ships, fleet after fleet, until I arrived at the doorstep of the Dimensional Portal... only to find that a rival empire had claimed a critical star system and closed their borders, blocking my path. My resources were nearly exhausted, and my fleet was months away from crumbling under its own weight so there was no time to find a diplomatic solution. I declared war. Alas, the allies in my federation were too cowardly to provoke another power while they were still in the midst of pushing back the Unbidden so I had to make a hard decision.

So I kind of expected a Civilization in space kind of game (Like Galactic Civilization 3) which isn't a bad thing since I love 4x games. But what I got was something different. a 4x, grand strategy, customizable, nearly open-ended RPG. And that is where this game sets itself apart from all others in the 4x field.Campaign 1 – Since everything was new I tried to chose things familiar. Humans, warp drive, materialist, individualist, etc... While I found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics I was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation. Eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power. With the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighbors, over-throw a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders. More than once I found myself wishing for more victory conditions, and when I started feeling like it was getting a little stale I pumped out a crap-ton of colony ships to meet the domination victory condition (owning 40% of habitable planets). All in all a good run.Campaign 2 – Within 5 years I had encountered a Fallen Empire and they hated me from the beginning, instantly declaring war, which I immediately had to surrender. A couple of years later I met ANOTHER Fallen Empire and THEY hated me. I was playing peaceful, scientist, cat people... Maybe everyone was allergic because everyone, even regular empires, kept insulting me, threatening me, and declaring war on me until I was finally curb-stomped into a chunky red paste. What did I learn from my violent and abusive loss? Better influence and sector management techniques. Campaign 3 – Military Dictatorship using wormhole generators to move. What a difference a little experience makes! Never once during this campaign did I find myself struggling with the influence mechanic and working with the oddities of the sector mechanic have become rather easy. Fallen empires treat me as a child in need of patience, enemies avoided my vast fleets and my economic power was unmatched.

What follows is three of the most interesting points in a campaign that has thus far spanned 180 years.Background:I named my empire ""The Galactic Empire"" and began the game as a militarist, materialist, and authoritarian.The Celimy Conflict:Early on, around the 50 year mark, I encounter a species of strange, fungal creatures. They call themselves the ""Celimy States"". They are fanatic spiritualists and pacifists. Fools.After a series of insults and the declaration of a rivalry, the Celimy declare war on me.My navy, christened the ""Grand Imperial Navy"", departs the Coruscant System to engage the Celimy ""Mycelium Carriers"", as they called themselves.A short time later, the Imperial Navy reaches the Celimy home system. Imperial transports land armies on their capital.The takeover is rapid, and at the end of the war the Celimy States has splintered into 3 separate nations: The Celimy Hegemony, the Celimy Confederacy and the Celimy Associates. Later on, the Associates would become my vassal. The Confederacy was a long standing enemy.The Galactic Civil War:Around 120 years in, the galaxy is almost fully filled with about 20 separate empires, and two distinct sides begin to form.On one side is myself and a federation called the ""Stellar Entente"", along with various other small empires.The other side is comprised of a vast array of small nations, led by the ""Karabnar Nations"".War breaks out, with the Karabnar declaring war on the Galactic Empire.I now have 3 fleets: The Star Corps, the Shock Battalion, and the Grand Imperial Navy. The Star Corps and Shock Battalion are relatively small shock forces, whereas the Grand Imperial Navy is my main force.A massive space battle in the Ocheron system involves over 1000 ships, with almost every known nation being present.The battle (which was beautiful to watch) was relatively even until the arrival of the Star Corps and Shock Battalion, who tipped the balance with fresh ships.The combined fleet of myself and my allies (yes, the AI is THAT good) eventually reaches Karab, the Karabnar Nations capital, and takes the system with the help of two Titanic Beasts recruited from the outer systems of the Empire.On the verge of victory, I am notified that a massive fleet is currently in orbit over Coruscant. Sent by the Hjaarthi Syndicate, one of our enemies, the fleet is in position to take our homeworld. My own fleets cannot reach Coruscant in time. All seems lost.A mere few days before Coruscant's fortifications would've failed, a fleet from one of my allies, the Verulian Compact, comes out of hyperspace above Coruscant and annihlates the enemy fleet.The Karabnar Nation and their allies surrender, and the war is won.The Fallen Empire (150 years in):A fallen empire (which is a fully developed but stagnant state) exists above me. They call themselves the Yz'Vorak Remnant (which I shortened to Y Remnant).They are military isolationists, and hate my empire with a special intensity.They insult mea and shortly afterwards declare war on my empire. This sort of war is usually a death sentence, so I move large numbers of people away from the Frontier and prepare to submit.At this point I've got 3 vassals. All are weak, but they are extremely loyal. The vassals join me in the war.All 3 of my fleets meet above Coruscant, along with Transports for my Droid Army (Irony, much)I deploy my entire military to the Jahab system, where we meet the Fallen Empire's forces.Their ships are unlike anything we've ever seen, and are incredibly powerful. We are losing the battle. Things are not looking good.Suddenly, out of hyperspace, come 3 fleets. my 3 vassals have brought everything they have to assist the effort. With their help, we drive back the Fallen Empire forces.Fastforward about 3 years.Through intense naval strategy and economic strain, Imperial forces have out matched the Y Remnant's fleet. The Grand Imperial Navy and the fleets of my vassals orbit above their capital: The Core.I don't have enough strength left to invade their planets, so I offer them a white peace.Fallen Empires cannot build new fleets, so this seemed logical enough.I recieve a notification:""Peace Accords on Coruscant""While signing the peace accords on Coruscant, two V Remnant agents who were standing next to the Emperor (of the Galactic Empire) killed him and mutilated his body.Furious, the Imperial Navy and the combined fleets of all of the Empire's vassals and allies immediately attack the Y Remnant Capital.Out of nowhere, a massive army from the Fallen Empire comes out of hyperspace over The Core (I still am not entirely sure where this army actually came from).In the epic battle that ensues, the Grand Imperial Navy defeats and destroys the Y Remnant's fleet, allowing the ground invasion of The Core to take place.With The Core fallen, the Fallen Empire cowers and begs for peace.The Y Remnant is annexed by the Galactic Empire.Peace reigns across the galaxy.Around 20 years later...Subspace energy surges indicate something we have not encountered before. A new being from out of our dimension makes contact. Their signal is not unlike a hunting call.....BY POPULAR REQUEST, AN UPDATE:Their name is the Unbidden and they make an immediate point.A transmission appears on my screen, depicting some kind of strange, ethereal being.They say something about prey and then the transmission cuts out.The Unbidden fleet is marked by science ship in the bottom part of the galaxy, below myself and the ""Qix'Lufran Combine"".The Qix'Lufran are isolationist authoritarians, but decide to deploy their entire fleet, the sole largest fleet in the galaxy, to immediately engage this extraterrestrial threat.The Qix'Lufran fleet reaches the Unbidden's position, and is utterly destroyed.This shocks the entire galaxy.Interestingly enough, these ""Unbidden"" would remain effectively dormant in their small region at the bottom of the galaxy. Not sure if it was because of the Fallen Empire bordering them, or simply because they were waiting for reinforcements. Either way, the Unbidden hold their position for the time being.The Great Intergalactic War:The Galactic Empire has become the most powerful and largest state in the galaxy. Above us, the ""Hjannarthi Syndicate"" exists, which nearly equals my own power. To our left is the ""Stellar Entente"" federation. To the right is the Njalax High Kingdom, and the Uriy Republic. Below us, the Zuifvan Imperium, the Qix'Lufran, and the Unbidden.Although there is a period of peace, there is great unrest in the galaxy.The Qix'Lufran and Njalax grow closer and closer every year.Eventually, they declare a defensive pact and close their borders to myself, the Stellar Entente and the Hjannarthi Syndicate.Their combined power rivals my own. they are dangerous.They undergo a combined massive military buildup, and begin to become increasingly aggressive.In mid july of 2412 (212 years in) the tensions boil over. The Njalax and the Qix'Lufran declare war on the Galactic Empire, the Hjannarthi, and the Stellar Entente. The galaxy is divided.A line is drawn essentially down the middle of the galaxy, dividing the left(Qix'Lufran and Njalax) from the right(Galactic Empire and Allies).I issue an immediate order to deploy the fleet. The long dormant Grand Imperial Navy assembles over Coruscant.Admiral Cognat leads the navy.My ever-reliable vassals send everything they have to join the Imperial Navy. I love those guys.The Stellar Entente's federation fleet strikes first. They use their wormhole stations to attack directly at the heart of the Njalax.My own fleet reaches the Qix'Lufran capital with relative ease, meeting almost no resistance.We confront a vastly outmatched Qix'Lufran force of 2 battleships and 18 corvettes.

Dune: Spice Wars;Gameologist;NOT INFORMED;352 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 60.3 hrs on record;"It seems to me that a lot of negative reviews are from people who either care deeply about having a story-driven campaign, who are die-hard fans of prior Dune games, and/or have very fixed ideas about what a Dune game (or an RTS) is supposed to be.For my part, I think it's absurd that Dune: Spice Wars has a ""Mixed"" rating as of the time of my review. Now, I am not a fan of traditional RTSes, and I would not want to play this game multiplayer. But if you're a single-player strategy game fan who usually prefers turn-based games or grand strategy titles like those made by Paradox, I think you'll find Dune: Spice Wars to be a lot of fun. The ability to pause means the twitchy, click-fest nature of RTS games isn't an issue, so you can play at a relatively slow pace and make tactical decisions without first having to develop the kind of muscle memory you'd need to be even half decent at games like Starcraft. So, again, this is an RTS for folks who like TBS and grand strategy.Part of what makes Dune: Spice Wars work - and part of why I think a purely narrative-driven campaign would be weird - is that this is a game of several interwoven systems. It reminds me of a Euro board game, with a great many resources to keep track of, strategic decisions to make, and paths to victory. It is not a game of tactics. Yes, you probably want to make sure your armies focus fire individual opposing units, and you can do some small micro with damaged units (moving them out of attack range), but this isn't Age of Empires. Rather, the focus of the game is on more strategic things like building a better economy than your opponent, having better information and mobility, and determining how your current situation meshes with your faction's particular strengths and weaknesses.Of course, like any system-driven game, Dune: Spice Wars does not have a ton of content. Maps ARE procedurally generated, so no two battles (or stages of a conquest) are the exact same, but Dune isn't exactly the most geographically varied setting in SciFi to begin with. Factions are definitely very different from each other both to play as and to play against, so that provides a good deal of variety. But if what you're looking for is a deep story with a ton to discover and explore, this game ain't it. There's no pretension at being a strategy game + RPG like a Crusader Kings or Age of Wonders. There's not really even emergent narrative as you might find in Europa Universalis or Stellaris. Nope, this is a strategy game, a game of mechanics and systems.I've been playing conquest mode and am enjoying it quite a bit in part because it mixes up your objectives from map to map. And I think it highlights one of Dune: Spice Wars's greatest strengths. It FEELS like a grand strategy game, but any given map only takes an hour or two to finish (maybe a tad more if you pause a lot, or possibly less if you're an expert and don't pause much). I have found that conquest mode in particular helps me scratch my grand strategy itch while still respecting my time and fitting into a couple hour gaming session after work in the evening, something I struggle with when playing many Paradox games, as it can take an hour for me just to get my bearings if I haven't played in a couple days, so I tend to play only when I have a large chunk of time to devote to a campaign.So, in summary, if you're a strategy board game fan, an EU4 fan, or a non-traditional RTS (think Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom) fan, Dune: Spice Wars is for you. It's an RTS in which the ""S"" is the star, rather than the ""RT"".";27 September, 2023;
Dune: Spice Wars;frogopus;NOT INFORMED;661 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 128.1 hrs on record;"*FYI some of this is out of date with a recent patch, but the game pace and balance has improved and looks like more is coming*I wanted to give a one to one response to the top review right now, because it misses the mark entirely. This is in reference to Cantore's review, which is currently in the top spot.1) ""1) The amount of spice you need to bribe the empire with always goes up. By a few hours into the game, you will have an extremely high spice tax rate that you will be forced to contribute. Failure to do so brings some really hefty consequences to one or more of your resources. And, it gets worse - it compounds each time the deadline is missed.""Spice is life. It's the most essential resource in the game, and you can't just ignore it. My guess is that the reviewer missed that you can control the slider that balances how much spice you stockpile vs how much you sell for cash to the CHOAM. As Smugglers in one game, I built my entire economy around black markets in enemy territory so 100% of my spice went into the stockpile for the Landsraad or periodic mission bribes. In another game, I took control of the Polar Cap, built a water harvester, and earned a fortune selling water and buying spice from others. You can expand your territory to find more spice fields. You can go down the research tree to build more crew on each harvester to extract more per territory, as well as build spice silo builds to produce 20% more. You can research to allow orinthopters to boost any harvester's they are over. You can search for ? items all over and assign missions to find stockpiles. You can buy spice from other factions by trading whatever resource you are specializing in. I've beat the game on normal or hard with each faction and never once missed a spice tax, but I always had to think about spice.2)""2) Given much more major battles exist in the end game, you would think there would be some way to offset the amount of spice you need to contribute. or a way to gain independence from them. There isn't.""See above. The CHOAM/Stockpile slider is where its at. As for gaining independence and just refusing to contribute, YOU CAN DO THAT TOO! There are ways to offset the penalties for missing tax day, and keep your favor with the Landsraad. You can focus on earning Influence and Intel, then run agent missions for ""Political Audits"" that boost your Landsraad standing +30 each time. There's HQ buildings that let you earn +1 Landsraad every tick. So you can generate an economy that can allow you to sell every bit of spice you get.3) ""3) REALLY SEVERE debufs exist in the game, and exacerbate further when other factions start messing with your manpower and health restore on your troops. I am TOTALLY against magic debufs, and this game has a LOT of them!""There are two types of debuffs. The direct buffs and debuffs that you can apply via agents, and the ones you can vote for/against doing the councils. To help counter agents, you can assign counter intelligence agents to catch and punish the factions that are hitting you with them. You can also vote for harsh punishments for a faction if they use one of these. You can of course run your own agents to build your own buffs and debuffs, and this is necessary. If you see that your force is being debuffed and you can't use your own agents to match... pull your forces out! Come back when you're better prepared.4) ""4) The periodic faction voting is meant to debuf another faction so you gain an upper hand on them. I hate it personally. It should be votes on actually meaningful things, not just everyone against me. I find myself putting all of my votes into stopping the worst of the consequences so I don't get debuffed to death! It's stupid and really pointless. It needs a serious overhaul!""Here's another part of the economy you can specialize in! You can absolutely build enough influence to control these votes. In the early game, its hard to pick more than one, but some factions specialize in manipulating this. As Atredies, you can bring Lady Jessica to give you the ability to remove debuffs. Smugglers can set bounties for factions to vote a certain way against a certain faction (and man do they like to vote for the things you pay them to). Harkonnens can secretly corrupt a vote that a faction may want to have so that the winning faction loses Landsraad standing. Buildings can generate influence for votes, you can trade for the resource, etc. As you build your standing, you could become Speaker of the council and get a chance to reroll one of the three options each week.5) ""5) The units. You have soldiers, but there's a MASSIVE penalty to having them... but you need them, or you'll die quickly. The more units you have the more manpower you don't have. You have to offset this with a bunch of recruitment stations all over the place by the time the game is well underway. Even then, if the enemy messes with the manpower or your health regen - you're cooked.""Manpower and water, another resource! Of course, you could do like I did with the Smugglers and build an entire Drone army run on nothing but money and batteries. Or you can earn some manpower by placing agents in the Space guild. You can specialize in a strong militia to protect each of your locations. Harkonnens can end up with a crazy strong militia in place if you build right. Place your missile batteries in the right spot and you can cover multiple territories for the cost of very little manpower. Well placed airports let you shuttle around a defending force to assist your militia wherever you need them (or ride the free worms if you're a Fremen). 6)""6) Units don't have any specialty skills or icons. They're just a unit with more or less number values than another. It would be nice to have the military line unlock special skills that a unit can perform, or a defensive or offensive boost. As it stands now, the game is more worried about unit consumption of manpower, power, and water. all of which is of no affect during a battle.""Every unit has a unique ability, some more passive than others. Atreidies like to have a varied army because each unit benefits the others in some way and some get stronger for each unique buff they get from others. Harkonnens inflict self damage, but can run agent missions to take drugs that keep you from dying. So you're holding out at one health hoping to finish things off quickly. Fremen can bring an advisor that boosts their strength for lone soldiers (and the run speed for everyone). You can then bring the unit that deals a ton of damage on its first attack, assassinate something and RUN. Smugglers are stronger against units as they lose supply (basically stamina), particularly their snipers. Their aoe attacker damages supply. Agent missions can damage supply. So theirs lots of strategies to exploit this. Each faction also gets a drone unit that works differently. It can cross territory that soldiers would have to walk a long ways around. They don't generate vibrations to draw worms.OUT OF SPACE. MOVING TO COMMENTS.";1 May, 2022;
Dune: Spice Wars;need.more.brain;292 products in account;166 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny; Recommended 52.7 hrs on record;"TL,DR:Real good RTS game with focus on FFA mode. Dune Spice Wars is a slow paced RTS. Unlike classic RTS your main goal is not to annihilate the enemy. With focus on a ""real"" FFA game mode (""Free for all"": no allied victory) you achieve victory by being opportunistic. Of course, you can still wipe the enemy base from the map. But you can also just eliminate the enemy leader, win by owning most spice shares, win by being elected the leader or by gathering the most hegemony points. In this regard, Dune feels far more like a real time Civilization than a Command & Conquer or Starcraft. Combat is very simplified. You rather have to prepare your assault correctly instead of pulling off some 300 apm micro skill set. Team games are possible, but I would say, they are not the core of the game.I see that the mixed reviews come from old school gamers, who expected more or less a sequel to the venerated Dune 2 from 1994. This game does not share anything but the setting with the Westwood games. Still, it is a great experience to play and it fills the RTS FFA niché like it intends to.";26 November, 2023;
Dune: Spice Wars;???????????;NOT INFORMED;238 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 603.0 hrs on record;I've never succeeded in creating a review for a game. I've attempted to many times but always thought that it never conveyed the XYZ of what makes the game great. However with Dune: Spice Wars I have to make a concerted effort as the Dune universe holds a dear place in my heart that allows me to be a proud Sci-fi fan. Anyone who has read the novels and/or watched the movies knows what they're expecting and Shiro Games have gone to great lengths to bring the Dune universe into a modern game setting, and they do not disappoint. I feel like the 4X system is the perfect way of conveying Dune into a game considering the scale. Just like Dune 2000 and Emperor: Battle for Dune did back in the day, Dune: Spice Wars is a worthy successor for the modern era. The art design, environment, visuals, aesthetics, model design, sounds, OST etc are excellent and really bring it all to life. Making the control for Arrakis even more immersive. There are currently 5 factions in the game and each of them have their own flavour and play style. A selection of Councillors (that are taken from the Dune lore) to give extra abilities to the faction you are playing, so from one game you can go for domination, to the next hegemony, and then to the next governorship victory conditions, making just 1 faction replayable over and over again. Each faction has access to unique buildings and research developments allowing you to play the way the faction was intended (from a lore perspective) but doesn't limit you just to play that way either. The unique mechanics some factions receive are also entertaining and very fitting - looking at you Harkonnen. The unit selection is very nice with each military unit serving a specific purpose in a combined army. Although some will be rated higher than others by the player base it's nice to have the choice, makes fighting engagements different each time. I could ramble on forever but I really do recommend this game, its a highly polished 'Early Access' game that is only going to get better with the patches and updates. Any Dune fan in particular will love this game. Any 4X player will probably also enjoy the game for its atmosphere and game mechanics while maintaining the 4x style you know and love.Update: Just like to say a massive thank you to those that have awarded this amateur-review, hope you found my crazy ravings somewhat useful. As the Air & Sand is here and has already received a patch thought I'd just point out a few updates. All factions have access to two air units. one being a light craft and the other a super heavy type. As you'd expect these units follow the same design of their faction's owner and has mixed up the game play even more. A neutral renegade faction that at a certain point start to land and claim villages to eventually gear up and send out raiding parties to attack you and your opponents. Three Wonder buildings to help you gain the edge in a certain aspect furthering your goals of victory. And of course even more patches of improvement and performance boosts. I wish I could be more critical of the game to provide you some negatives but I've currently played 400+ hours and encountered very little. A few visual bugs and pathing, maybe? But nothing game-breaking and considering the 2012 laptop I'm running with its integrated graphics? I'm surprised this game runs for me at all. Also will mention to any of those that are worried about the game system requirements. I have Win10 | i3 | 6GB | Intel HD 4000 Graphics and all my in game graphics set to low and I get between 20-25 fps and at worst (heavy battles) around 15fps, not the best I know but I'm used to games running mega slow on this old girl. If you have anything better than above (and I'm sure you do) the game will run even better than stated above. This game is still in Early Access and with the current update my game runs even better.

Dune: Spice Wars;ferand;NOT INFORMED;535 people found this review helpful10 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 53.7 hrs on record;Dune: Spice Wars is almost a good game, but not quite, and definitely not a great game. (50+hrs spent)It's beautiful. The art style is great. The map is stunning. It's exciting as a Dune fan to see the world well described and brought to life. The developers have done quite a few things really well. The gameplay has a lovely first 10-15hrs as you learn the basic game mechanics and then through various playthroughs how each of the 5 faction's different styles work. Unfortunately, after that initial challenge there's really not a hell of a lot more to it. I really like the attempts to include espionage and politics as important parts of gameplay however none of it is very deep (yet). The combat is pretty average, and not very strategic. In fact for a game based around controlling territory it's surprising how basic (and ultimately boring) the strategic element is.The units feel a little boring and similar and yet I don't feel going in the direction of Dune 2/Starcraft 2 unit variety would be the right choice for this game.I will certainly return to the game through early access to see what's improved but it feels like the direction the developers have taken might be hard-baked into the game at this point and it's difficult to see it undergoing the fundamental rethink I think it needs to be a strategic challenge. (This is a review from single player, I haven't tried multiplayer and I suspect much of their design is focused around a multiplayer game) There are other small issues OP or broken in the game (like how laughably easy it is to destroy an enemy base using supply drops, rotating troops out of combat, and killing enemy troops as they spawn in ones and twos) but fixing them would just be fiddling with with what I think is ultimately a flawed strategic design for the game.There is an excellent table-top game out called Dune Imperium where choices feel strategic and important, controlling certain character (cards) can be game changing, and where there are several different and challenging play-styles you can do to achieve victory.I wish this game could some how incorporate something similar, where choices feel impactful and important and competition for 'resources' extend from the spice fields into something that feels worth getting like useful characters for espionage, influence with various non-player factions, and political.Some of this is there, it's just kept at what seems like an un-impactful/repetitive level.I truly hope I'm proven wrong as the game is beautiful, there's a lot of talent and good work here and it would be great to play a great game set in the Dune universe!;16 June, 2022;

Its not a 4X-Game, the overview-map has only one purpose: to choose your next RTS-mission. So more a RTS with 4X-elements. And its not a really complex game. It may look like it - but no, the game mechanics are rather easy and straigth forward. After you know which can be ignored, it gets very repetitive, you basically do every single mission the same thing an win. So, it is a decent and rather well balanced RTS, but don´t expect a deep and complex 4X!The Problem is, Dune has so much background lore to offer, a world of storys to tell and wonders to discover - but nope, not in this game, this game is just totally generic. The campaign (if you call it a campaign) has no story, no narrative, whatsoever (just conquer the map, its the same for all factions), there is not even a background story, no deeper lore, nothing. You just play more or less random missions, until you win. Thats it. You know its Dune becaus the factions are called ""Harkonnen"", ""Artreides"" and you are harvesting ""spice"". If you would call the factions ""Federation"" and ""Klingons"", and the ressource ""Latinum"" (or whatever), you could sell it as a StarTrek-game.So, to sum it up: a decent rather generic and slightly shallow RTS game. It is fun to play, but it is NOT a 4X, it is NOT complex and it feels NOT like Dune. Just be aware of this.I give a thums-down despite the game itself is not bad, its a good foundatiin to build on. But a good foundation alone is not good enough, one has to build something on top of it. I hope the Devs will deliver a real campaign with story later with more lore and more dune."; 25 February;

I did have several smaller ones. I do recommend it, but here is a couple of my personal recommendations on how to best use it:- It goes without saying that you should create a restore point before updating any drivers. Driver updates can go wrong even when using first-party software.- Don't use it to update GPU drivers from AMD or Nvidia. Exclude those from updates and use their first-party update tools instead. Reason is that those get updates so often that there are often version mismatches.- The only problem I've had is after updating ""NVM Express Controller"" my Intel SSD stopped showing up. Rolled back and blacklisted that driver - now everything works perfectly.- Otherwise I've used this software on 5 PCs and 2 laptops, and recommended it to 4 of my friends who use it on 7 computers in total. The issue I've described before is the only one I've ever encountered or heard about.As to why you shouldn't buy the Pro version:- Its ""flagship feature"" is updating runtimes, which can very often lead to issues. Whatever runtimes your software comes with are the exact ones said software has been tested, running other ""better"" versions can lead to unexpected behavior. The free version has everything you actually want.- Another reason not to buy is that the ""Lifetime Licenses"" are always ?????????, every company screws their ""lifetime licencees"" at some point in some way.- Another reason not to buy is that people seem to have a problem upgrading the Steam version of Driver Booster from Free to Pro, it sometimes has problems switching.";13 February, 2023;

So many survival games die on the vine but so far this does not look like one of them.It is unique enough to stand out from the pack. With the planned content (modding support will be great) this may stand out from the slower grind that is Project Zomboid. The only cons right now is sometimes weapon switching can be tedious as you have to drag and switch between long and short weapons, and in the heat of battle it can get messy.

The larger your team the more fun it is. Turn on friendly fire and now it becomes dangerous fun.- Top-down state of decay (which was a great game).- Easy to get into and understand.Cons:- Buuuuugs (getting stuck in things, zombies that treat unfinished barricades like finished ones, controls not working, buggy chat window, etc).- Boring buildings. The map it huge and there are a few interesting locations, but as a whole it's all just the same few buildings copy pasted around. Not that dynamic and lessens incentive to explore. - Vehicles are kinda unimaginative. There are interesting vehicles around (big trucks, bulldozers, HMMWVs) but the only driveable ones are your typical pickup/police SUV/coup. - Price is kinda high for what it offers right now. - No sandbox mode, which makes it hard to understand/experience all there is- No mod support yet- Overly simplistic yet confusing/counter-intuitive controls in some cases (e.g. left click moves something to your bag and right click consumes it from a container, but in your bag right click left click consumes it and right click drops it, better to make everything a right click with a context menu).I'll revise my review in a few months depending on the direction this takes, but for now I recommend it as a fun way to kill a few hours with friends and support a developing game.

HumanitZ;xycle;NOT INFORMED;206 people found this review helpful5 people found this review funny; Recommended 48.4 hrs on record;"HumanitZ plays a lot like PZ. If you like PZ, then you'll probably like HZ. But there's key differences aside from graphics. Differences include:1. Character levels up as you kill more zeds/zeeks. Leveling up gives you a skill point which you can spend to upgrade a skill from the skill tree.2. Cars only has 4 parts: a fan belt, a starter, a battery, and a fuel pump. Also, cars get destroyed easily. A friend and I went for a ride around town, he bumped like maybe 10 zeds and our car went up to smoke. XD3. Zombies are not the only threat. Personally, I die more from dogs and raiders. I see a dog and I run.4. There's AI traders that you can call using a radio.5. Fire weapon works. Shooting gas can barrels explode. There's also a grenade and an RPG I haven't tested yet.I enjoy HZ as much as PZ but everytime I play, I couldn't help but compare it to PZ. Like my thought bubble always has an opinion that ""I wish they did this like PZ"". I'm certain the game only improves in time and with further updates. Also excited what modders will do to the game next year.Conclusion: It's PZ with better graphics. But with everything else (as of now), PZ does it better. Looking forward to where the creators take this game in the future! :D";31 October, 2023;

HumanitZ;Unknownhost;NOT INFORMED;213 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 64.4 hrs on record;After being given the opportunity to play this game pre release , I put 22 hours into it over 2 day. So far so good. As a 1.7k hours Pz player there are a few similarities. Its isometric , it has zombies and you survive. For me that's where it ends , it has its own mechanics for all things like combat , gun play , building and more which is refreshing. There are things i would like to see improved/added/tweeked (personal and not ) which i have already passed to the Dev team who seem to be very active and listen with intent about their game which again is refreshing, these btw are in no way game breaking bugs though , more finer polish and inner workings. So far after 22 hours it has run buttery smooth and even when playing MP which seemed to work pretty flawlessly for me, only slight jumps but that was due to ping issues playing with someone in Canada (me being the Uk) so was expected. I will be following this game closely and seeing where it goes whilst i sink my teeth into it on a regular basis. For EA i think it hits the mark. Please remember these are personal opinions and a honest review of what i have seen up untill this point. Through time i might update if needed.;18 September, 2023;

HumanitZ;Razorhunter;NOT INFORMED;91 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Recommended 10.1 hrs on record;"3.6 hours into it As im absolutely into zombie survival games i really had to try Humanitz out even tho its kind of a raw state of development and there are quite some issues. Nevertheless i had a really fun time getting into it as 2 player coop with the wife.The Good-Most of the stuff is easily understandable right away (no tutorial or anything needed)-The core gameplay and movement are solid and the top down perspective is a fresh experience here-Melee combat has LOTS of weight to it, really satisfying to chunk zombos away-Ranged gameplay ranges from good to meh. The bow lacks impact, hard to tell if i hit. Rest is cool-The crafting system, even tho barebones, is fun! Its cool to loot stuff and progress in general-POIs are definitely interesting for now and they will add many more in the future-Overall solid quality of sounds and tracks alike -Day/Night Cycle + Season Cycles (Autumn, Winter etc). Feeling definitely unique and different and influence gameplay-A solid visual variety of zombies and also different types that require some attention-Multiplayer worked really flawless for about 98% of aspects-No hand holding, a limited UI and theres quite some aspects to figure out yourself. I like that!-Lots of animations for eating and drinking with correct displays of the specific object in the hand -> BIG PROPS very cool-The character kneels down and opens the bagpack when you open the inventory, huge immersive factor right here <3-All the stuff you got equipped in your five ""main"" slots are also visible on the character.-You can run over most of the beings in the world easily and satisfying, even tho the vehicle takes absurd amount of damage by thatThe Issues-Bugs like already looted trees not syncing in coop so you chop away until you realize nope nothings gonna happen here-Encountered one or two window vaults after which i was totally stuck unable to get away, had to die to keep playing-Graphics arent great to look at but theyre not that terrible either, its okayish-Loot and crafting is for now kinda few, like its not bad at all but it needs more and more content over time for sure-When eating or drinking while having something in your hand your character will simply put both the axe and the cola drink up to the mouth .) .. you get it-Limited options for creating your character, its decent enough for now but once again we need more in the future :D-Item stacks on max are oftentimes way too small which results in many unneccessary slots being takenAnd my biggest tilter for now was the TERRIBLE inventory management. You cant drag stuff around into which slot you want, instead it has an automatic slot for slot sort order -> annoying.Also swapping stuff out and inbetween the 5 ""main"" slots is really annoying when finding new gears and you want to put some of the old stuff into the backpack and after all its very chaotic its not working very well and its just annoying to do. So carrying around various weapons and tools results in many annoying moments. Really looking forward to some QOL changes here but i got my hopes up!Overall i cant say much about difficulty or hordes, i just didnt play long enough yet. The game has a super solid foundation and lots of potential to become a serious entry in the survival pool of games. Super interested in getting deeper into it and following the development :)If a dev reads that. id be down to help out on translating the game into the german language. Just hit me up if you need another helping hand on that aspect. After all im happy to support a promising title here, its definitely not overpriced and i recommend everyone giving it a chance that is into zombie survival like Zomboid or 7days.

Full stop.If you've ever played any of the Naruto Storm games by Cyberconnect2 you are gonna find the combat in this game very familiar, the simple B button smash combos and fast dashes still remain and, when powered up, super attacks trigger cutscenes too. So overall a familiar feel to the combat, but in general Kakarot is its own beast.Definitely the best thing about it is the amazing attention to detail from both manga and anime, I'll name a few of them:-Power levels rise along with the story progression and are accurate in every event of the anime.-Transforming strenghtens Saiyans ridiculously and makes other characters useless, just like in the anime.-Stuffing your face with food before a battle is OP, just like in the anime.-You go faster by flying. But you still use Nimbus. Because you know it's fun. Just like in the anime.-You can race cars and ask Bulma for parts in her workshop, just like in the anime.-Yes, you can properly collect Dragon Balls and spam Shenron wishes, just like in the anime.-Korin gives you free Senzu beans overtime. Yes they are OP as they should, just like in the anime.-The end game Super Spirit Bomb is so huge it's rendered out of the frame, just like in the anime.-The cutscenes are... you know it. Just like the anime.I could go on and on about every tiny detail there is, only noticed if you are a fan and care to look deeper, but it would be a long post. Hopefully these few things I mentioned are enough to make you buy the game and get immersed in what I think it's the best DBZ universe experience ever made.

It's an RPG with a semi-open world and some pretty neat but kinda simple combat once you get to grips with it. It's not ground breaking, and it's not Tenkaichi 4, so folks can just cool off.But what it IS, is a really, REALLY enjoyable trip through the DBZ story, told better than ever before (in game format, anyways). It's rich, and deep, and pretty as all hell, and I love it for what it is.At least, so far anyways. I'm about 3.5 hours in right now and I'd be playing more if I didn't have work in the morning. If I play more and decide that it's actually not that great, I'll update my review to reflect that, but as of right now these are my feelings.

Police Simulator: Patrol Officers;Swoto;NOT INFORMED;432 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny; Recommended 5.7 hrs on record;I'll start off with the bad, just so everyone knows what they're getting into.Firstly, there is a lot of missing content. Yes, the game is in early access, but this is VERY early access. As in, entire chunks of the game and mechanics have not been implemented yet. You're basically playing a demo. That doesn't mean it's unplayable, in fact on the contrary, many similar games would stop here and call it finished. But be aware there's still a lot left to add.Second, there are two types of missions, car and foot. Car missions are borderline unplayable at the moment due to horrible vehicle and pedestrian A.I. You can try, but you'll quickly become frustrated by how infuriatingly often pedestrians run right out in front of your vehicle while you're going 65, or the cars in front of you park in the street and refuse to move aside so you can get through. The A.I. is abysmal and the car handling isn't much better. It definitely needs work.Third, the map design is just short of atrocious. As I mentioned before, car missions are hardly worth the trouble, so you'd think foot missions would be much better, right? Well, they are, until you get a mission clear across the zone that you have to run all the way to, on a map with almost zero alleyways or space between buildings, so you have to take massive detours around entire blocks of buildings just to get to the other side, entirely on foot. As for the positive, the good things you've heard about this game are most definitely true. The core game is a well fleshed-out, decently fun police officer simulator that offers enough entertainment to always be busy, but not so much that you'd think you're some kind of action hero. It's always a pleasant surprise when stopping someone for littering turns into a full-on chase through the city, and trying to figure out who's guilty at a crash scene only to realize both drivers are on meth is just as fun as it sounds.If the game continues being regularly updated, as it should be, I'd say it's a no-brainer purchase for anyone that likes the job simulator genre.My fear, however, is it won't receive the updates it needs to be an actually great game.If you're on the fence, check the update history. If it's been updated more than a couple times since this review was posted, pick it up. If not, you know which route it decided to go. And, as always with early access games, you only have yourself to blame if you spend the money and it gets abandoned.;19 June, 2021;
Police Simulator: Patrol Officers;MPprince;NOT INFORMED;396 people found this review helpful9 people found this review funny; Recommended 4.0 hrs on record;"I will post my recent recommendations on the September version of the Beta release. As a real police officer, hopefully some of these could be added. Hopefully this is seen by the developer. I recommend the game because it is interesting and quite immersive at times. It could be an all time great with some really good updates. I will update my review in the future.""Hello Mr. or Mrs. Developer. I love your game, I am on my way to post a positive review. As a police officer, can I give some suggestion to add to realism:Chasing:- You should be able / and required actually, to yell ""stop police"" as you are running. Also in many jurisdictions you are not permitted to use intermediate force options such as Taser on fleeing individuals. Typically you present that force option when presented a threat queue of some kind, even as simple as them turning to fight. You would not threaten to Taser an individual in the back for example. Also the yelling ""stop police"" identifies you and makes clear they are under arrest, and being lawfully ordered to stop. Car:- You should be able to roll up and talk to citizens from your car. Often we stop and say ""did you see this guy"". Could be good for open warrants. You have already addressed driving mechanics in the newest beta here, so thanks for that.MVA/MVI Collision:- You should be required to follow up regarding injuries or at least note them before they leave in ambulance. This typically goes on to the collision report and in the police report. I am also yet to have witnesses standing near by. I would like to walk around the immediate area and maybe find an ""independent witness"".Disturbance:- I am only a few hours in, but are there any disturbances in this game? Such as two individuals (could be domestic related too). Would be interesting to come across a couple arguing or have a fight develop, then you split the parties and talk to each one. Not sure if this comes up, but a few hours in and I hope this is something to do eventually. Dialogue: - Criminals or ""clients"" as we say, are rarely as nice as the ones in the game. They need a bit more edge, not cartoon like, but a bit more realism. Also whining about an expired DL ticket is probably not their focus when they just got arrested for fleeing and Theft.Other police officers:- First of all, we need way more NPC models for the officers. Like, waaay more.- I would like to see other police cars driving around. The only other cars I have seen at this point are the transports. Again, not sure if this comes up later, but after hours, I would expect to see some of my buddies on foot patrol, or stopped dealing with other stuff. As dark as it is, officer injured or down scenarios? Sometimes the question is, do I provide aid to my partner or go after the suspect? Would be good to make those calls and deal with some dynamic situations.Overall, for the price tag and concept, I find the game very interesting. I think some of these realism additions could really make this an all time great ""sim"".";2 September, 2022;

If you look at the math, there's actually many more Gokus in this game than one might expect. Of course, we've got the three main Gokus, but there's also Vegito, who is 0.5 Gokus due to being a fusion with Vegeta. Then, we have Gohan, who is half Goku and half Chi-Chi, making him also 0.5 Gokus, so since we have two of him, this brings our current total to 4.5 Gokus. We've also got Gotenks. Gotenks is 0.25 Gokus, because he is both a child and a fusion. Now our total is 4.75.There's also Goku Black. While he has the mind of Zamasu, his body is 100% Goku, making him count as one Goku nonetheless. Fused Zamasu is 50% Goku Black, making him also 0.5 Gokus.Next, Bardock. Goku is 50% Bardock, which in turn means that Bardock is 200% Goku, making him two whole Gokus. This brings our total to 8.25 Gokus.Perfect Cell and Android 21 are kinda weird, but according to a commenter Perfect Cell is 0.166 Gokus, and Android 21 is 0.151 Gokus, which brings us to a total of 8.567 Gokus.With the FighterZ Pass 2 giving us GT Goku and SSB Gogeta, we now have another one and a half Gokus, but the new pass also brings us the Great Saiyaman as part of Videl's moveset, which is another half Goku, bringing the current total number of Gokus to 10.567.And with FighterZ Pass 3 we have been given yet another Goku, this time in his Ultra Instinct form, as well as another fusion in the form of SSJ4 Gogeta, which brings the total to 12.067.;9 August, 2018;

The Long Dark;cherniyalpinist;NOT INFORMED;1,109 people found this review helpful15 people found this review funny; Recommended 120.5 hrs on record;"Alright, ladies and gentlemen - I have just reemerged back into the real world, after almost 100 days (99 days 18 hours) survival in one playthrough. With that up my sleeve, I'll be bold enough to say that I know a thing or two about this game and ready to try and write an adequate review. So gather round, grab a cup of hot chockolate and have a listen to what uncle Chern's got to tell ya :)I'll split my review into three sections - pros, cons and things that are considered negative by some reviewers, but not necessarily are.Let us start with the cons, because this list is the shortest... and because I am grumpy old b*****d who likes to criticize. So...CONS:MAP - Map in the current version of the game is not very large. There are only a few points to explore and salvage from. So after you have visited them all (which can... and probably should... be done in the first few days of your survival), the game becomes a bit repetitive. Go find meat - go collect some wood - cook - eat/drink - sleep - repeat from step one. Saying that - it does add to realism. Real survival in the wilderness is far from glorious and comes down to just that - get food, cook, keep sated, hydrated and warm. But still it would be nice to have more areas to poke your nose around :)LOOT (sometimes) - Loot in the game is mostly random... which is a good thing and adds to realism and replayability value, but at some playthroughs it can get bloody stupid. Sometimes you may have enough ammo to get out of Canadian wilds, venture to Afghanistan and assist several ISAF operations, have three knives, 5 packs of MRE rations, ton of medical supplies and good gear. Sometimes it may be evenly and fairly spread-out - so you find a good bit of everything in moderate ammount... And sometimes it gets silly. On my previous to last playthrough i found 5 can openers, no MREs, no repair tools, one almost broken knife and ton of degraded clothing. I still managed 41 days and died of stupidity (went to bed while freezing, and hoped I'll warm up... I didn't), but be warned - never know what you might get and life isn't always fair :)LONG DARK - No matter what you do, in the end your character is goind to punch that snuff button and check out. That can be quite depressing, that after toughing it out for 2-3 months, heroically navigating through blinding blizzards, savagely fighting wolves for half frozen (and half eaten) deer carcasses, you still going to die. I know - it wouldn't be ""The Long Dark"" game if you didn't fade into the long dark in the end and it makes this game highly competitive among the players, but it would be nice if there was an option for some sort of happy ending to the game. Maybe they'll do it for story mode later on. FLUFFY - I am not going to spoil it for you. You'll get to know him as you play the game. Be afraid... be very afraid... and never let your guard down. Cause the very moment you think you're safe and relax, the cruel reality will bite you in the ***... literally.Other than that - there are no bad things about this game. I wouldn't even use a word ""bad"" to describe all of the above - there are no bad things, just areas for improvement (just please don't change fluffy - leave him where he is - we all love him really... ok, he's completely evil ***hole, but it wouldn't be so much fun without him). Now, that we are done with those negative waves, let us switch to the positive side and see how beatiful this game is :)PROS:REALISM - Ok,.. let's get this straight - no simulator will duplicate the real thing - ever. As a keen climber and outdoorsman, I could have listed countless things that can be added to this game, from the realism perspective. But, so far, this game is as close as computer game can get to real-life survival (if you know anything better - please feel free to suggest). It is not casual, it is not skyrim with most hardcore ""eat, sleep, drink"" mods, it does not hold your hand, nor cuts you any slack. It's simple - ""ok, you're in **** - get surviving""... and if you can't - hey, it's natural selection for you. So forget all the fancy Bear Grylls shows - no climbing cliffs, no running butt-naked through the winter forest and then trying to replenish your calories by munching on a squirell. Conserve your calories whenever and wherever you can, keep warm and hydrated, keep your gear in working order and adapt adequately to anything the wilderness throws at you - no heroics, no pointless wondering or taking chances, just timely well-planned actions... or it's game over.IMMERSION - The atmosphere of this game is absolutely marvellous. Nevermind cartoon graphics - sound, tension and your imagination (if you have any) totally do their trick. Howling of the wind outside at night, does set the mood in, whilst howling of the wolves at dusk, will send that tingle down your spine and motivate you to keep your rifle handy and get inside as soon as you can. And there is a really cosy and safe feeling, when you are sitting by the fire late at night, cooking your meal and celebrating your survival for yet another day. REPLAYABILITY - As mentioned before, the loot is pretty random. So every time the gear made available for the picking would be a little different and so will be your situation. Sometimes it will be bad and other times it will be just plain awful... Deal with it :)FLUFFY - Well, you know... :)Finally, let us take a quick look on things, that have been criticized by many players, but that are not entirely that bad.BALANCE - There have been numerous complaints from the players about calories ticking away too fast or equipment degrading too fast. It's a fair point, but guys - let's not forget that this is a game and players should be kept occupied. There would be a lot less to do if your equipment didn't degrade overtime and so the game would be just repetitive cooking and wood-foraging almost from start to finish. And that's a bit boring - don't we all agree?If we are talking realism, then how about adding the fact that your clothing will be soaking wet after couple of hours outside, thus will become a lot colder not overtime but right away and will require good bit of drying to become warmer again? Or how about the fact that your ammo may get damp and unusable, or your rifle itself will require good thorough cleaning regularly, or wood that also will require drying, before it can be set on fire with a match and paper? And so on, and so on... Full realism will make some things easier, but will make a load of other things the hell of a lot harder. So stop wimpering, fix those damn woolen socks with a bit of cloth, patch up can opener with some rusty scrap metal and get out there :)))WOLVES - To my surprise I've seen quite a few complaints about abundance of wolves in the game and the wolf AI. Personally I do not know why anyone would complain about wolves - wolves in this game are your best friends, right after your winter coat, rifle and knife. In fact you may not need rifle when you got those guys around. On my last playthrough I have run out of ammo, by about 70th day. I survived for almost 30 days more. Guess how? I waited untill some wolf takes down a deer, then scared him off with a flare or fought him off with my fists and hoooray - 8kg of free venison every time. All thanks to wolves... poor buggers - I owe them some beers. As to complaints about a wolf AI, I don't see what's wrong with it. Yes - the hungry wolf in the middle of the winter will try to have you for lunch - if there's no easier prey to be had, they will attack human (both in this game and for real). Once again - be thankful for ""non-realism"" and having to deal with lone wolves every time. In real life you'd have a whole pack of them on your ***. Do you feel lucky? :)It seems like my word limit is up... Shame :) Anyway - get this game and play it. It's 100% worth it. Thanks for reading :)";13 October, 2014;
The Long Dark;FumblingMaoMao;586 products in account;422 people found this review helpful22 people found this review funny; Recommended 39.6 hrs on record;"The Long Dark is not for everyone. Far from it - it's slow to the point of being tedious. uncaring, and at times unfair. Only the most fundamental mechanics are explained, but most things you have to learn on your own. ""Fundamental"", by the way, means ""use the action wheel for quick access, put on a bandage or you bleed to death."" Things like ""you can fix your clothes when you have a sewing kit, which will improve its protection against the elements"" or ""being outside during rain and snow can and will soak your clothes to the point that they can freeze"", you have to learn the hard way. I still don't know what the consequences to freezing clothes are, but it certainly can't be good. So why, oh why would I recommend you buy it? Because your clothing can freeze if you are outside during -23°C. You can snap a rabbits neck to survive, but the kicker? Rabbits have a poor nutritional value. Wind and temperature are different factors, to the point where you can feel additional -17°C just from standing in the open - but you can take cover from the wind, reducing the effect.There is so much love in the intricacies of outside survival and they put so much effort into making it feel real that I can see why they have to put a large disclaimer on the very first screen you see when loading the game, telling you ""no, this isn't actual survival training, don't try this at home"". They are doing a wonderful job at what they are trying to do. Yet, there are downsides to this. As I said, this game is slow: you can take a minute making a fire, only for it to fail at 98% complete. You can walk through the snow for 15 minutes, being able to see just a few meters ahead, only to find out you went vastely off course, shortly before you die of exhaustion.This is not a game you start up for a quick relief of reality. It takes an hour to traverse most areas and that's not including actual exploration.Important: Story mode isn't complete yet. It's episodic (you keep all your stuff when going from one to the next) and so far 2 of 5 have been released.The team is still working on the game, and they are a bit behind with the 3rd episode because they revisited 1 and 2 after player feedback of the story being too linear. Which is probably worth mentioning in that yes, the story is rather linear at the moment, which I felt to be a problem only at one point, and that the developer actually listens to feedback.I genuinely enjoy the game and can only recommend it to everyone who likes survival and a slightly apocalyptic feeling. Also snow. So, so much snow. This game makes you feel cold even in your room. By the way, should you run out of food, but have an axe and a strong clicking finger, you can go ???? with the wolves. It will hurt you, sometimes more, sometimes less, but wolves can have up to 5kg of meat - enough to get you easily through two days.Man, I really hate wolves.Edit: Butchered a sentence in there.December Edit: They did, finally, release a new episode in October. They are taking their sweet time, but yes, they are still working and delivering.";1 April, 2018;
The Long Dark;Hit;359 products in account;905 people found this review helpful203 people found this review funny; Recommended 87.3 hrs on record;"I've survived for way more than a month here.At this point I have a very well stocked house at mystery lake. I have almost 100kg of meat ready to be eaten, freezed on the snow for conservation. I have a ton of fresh water just sitting there. I've killed bears, moose, wolves. Anything that can be killed I have done it. I probably have more bullets than animals on the surroundings, and then a lot of arrows and a homemade bow too.I'm a master fisherman, hunter and I can start a fire easily in the middle of the storm. I make my own clothes from animal skins.It's clear that I've now beaten the game. There is nothing it can throw at me at this point that I'm not prepared for. At least that was what I thought, but I hadn't taken account of my own stupidity...One day, I was taking a walk to my favourite hunting area, with the hope of catching some deer to make me a new pair of deerskin pants.I suddenly realized there was a mountaineering rope, hanging down a cliff. ""Wow, I haven't seen that before, lets take a look"", I thought.I started what it felt like a long climb just to reach a big ledge at the end of the rope, almost running out of stamina in the process. Looks like I carried too much weight, but anyway I did it.Looking around me, there wasn't a lot. The rope didn't reach the top of the cliff, it just ended on a big ledge halfway to the top, with only a few branches on its ground.When I was getting ready to climb back down, disappointed, I saw there was another climbing rope, hanging down from the top of the cliff to the ledge I was in.""Thats where the big prize should be"", so I grab that second rope without hesitation and started climbing up again, but man, I didn't realized it was going to be so hard. When I was on the middle of this second rope, it was clear I was not going to make it. My hands were hurting so bad that I had to go down on a rush, barely making to the ledge before running out of stamina completely.Well, I'm stupid, I carry too much weight, that's why I couldn't climb it. So I left almost anything I was carrying on the ledge, and got ready for another try.Now I felt much lighter and I was sure I could make it to the top. But as I was climbing my confidence started to vanish. God it is really a long climb. There is no way I can make this time. I need to go down while I can.I rushed down to the ledge again, but, when I was getting close to it, my hands slipped and I fell to the snow, twisting my ankle on the process.Not a big deal, I always carry a lot of painkillers with me so I took a pair of then and was back on track before even knowing it.At that point I realized how tired I was, climbing is an exhausting activity. My fatigue indicator was on the red and I was falling asleep while standing.Ah, thats why I couldn't make it to the top. I was so tired from the first climb that climbing the second rope was just too much.Luckily I always carry my sleping bag with me, you never know, so I decided to take a nap there on the ledge, and then try again for the second climb, this time being well rested so I could make it to the top.The cold woke me up. I was totally freezing. A storm had descended while I was sleeping and I had contracted hypotermia. I could barely see, or walk.Oh ????. Wtf was I thinking? I crawled through the ledge, desperately trying to gather all the branches I could find to start a fire. Although my burry vision made it real hard and I felt like I was going to die any moment, I did it. I started a good fire from sticks, enough to warm me up again, or, at least, prevent me from freezing to death right there.Wow, that was close. I got back into the sleeping bag, this time near the fire, hoping to rest a little more to warm me up and gather enough strengh for the climb down. At that point, obviously, I had abandoned all hopes to get to the top and I was just thinking on returning to the safety of my house on the lake, so I could recover.When I woke up, the fire was almost running out, but I had recovered a little condition. There were no more branches on the ledge and the sun was setting on the horizon, so it was now or never, I had to get down or die there.I dropped almost anything I carried there, on the snow, so I didn't have to carry its weight, including my precious rifle with all it's ammunition, and then grabbed the downward rope with my tingling hands.Climbing down from the ledge wasn't easy, in fact it was exactly the opposite, but I managed to go down a good deal before slipping again when I was around 3 meters from the ground, twisting my battered ankle one more time.Well, I left my painkillers along with all my equipment on the ledge, but at least I was on the ground again. I was badly injured and almost dead, but I was on the ground again. Now I only had to cross the lake and get to my house to rest until I'm fully healed, surrounded by food, water and firewood. It's not going to a pleasant walk, but I can make it.I started crawling towards the riverside when I suddenly heard a loud growl.Searching through my blurry vision, I saw a dark siluhette getting closer and closer. ""Ffs why always me?"", I though while I maniacally reached for my rifle, only to realize I left it there on the ledge, along with anything else that could be of help.I turned around and started running like hell, at least I tried, but it's not an easy task with a twisted ankle and a bad case of hypothermia. A few moments later, 40kg of anger and teeth impacted on my back, knocking me down into the long dark.";25 June, 2018;
The Long Dark;StealthBirdie;NOT INFORMED;485 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny; Recommended 170.6 hrs on record;"This game deserves such a longer and more well thought out review than what I will write here today, but I've sat on this review for too long as is. I've been playing this game since it was in Alpha, and have long been in love with it. The story mode doesn't live up to what I think it could, at least in my thinking, but I'm not too fussed about that, because the real meat and bones of this game is and always has been the sandbox survival mode. Please don't be fooled by the term ""sandbox"" to think that it's some unfinished non-game-- the narrative that this game's survival mode always had from way back in Alpha was that your character is going to die here. All you're doing is trying to survive as long as possible. You might even succeed at making a comfortable home with renewable resources and live to day 500 with no end in sight--people have indeed done that, actually. But the point isn't to escape or to tame the wilderness. There is no taming it. there is only surviving and trying to carve out a place of safety or two. There are multiple modes to choose from, including one where the wildlife won't attack you (I played the game on this mode for most of my first hundred hours before I finally stopped being scared of the wolves). one where they attack, but aren't your biggest threat when compared to the environment itself and weather. one where you're operating with limited resources and the environment is even harsher. and one where everything is incredibly harsh. There is also a custom mode that lets you decide what aspects you want to play with. The devs are constantly working on this game and adding things in (they swore for years they would never add a custom mode, but finally gave in to the fans' persistent pleas), and they are frequently running special events (just recently, they had a Halloween event where some monster was chasing you around the maps! Too spooky for me, but it sounded incredible). As they continue to work on the story mode (it's episodic), they have been releasing updated maps with more places to shelter and go, and new mechanics, and even entirely new regions to explore! This is a final, released game, but it was already worth the cost when it was still barely out of Alpha mode, and the fact that it's still living and breathing and evolving per the fans' desires and the devs' vision is incredible and worth supporting. If you enjoy survival games, then there is no reason not to get this game. Manage your caloric intake, exhaustion, encumbrance, hydration, warmth, item durability, and scent while you keep an eye on the weather, your safehouses, and the wildlife in order to survive the brutal snowscape. ...Or go to peaceful mode and enjoy the loot-bonanza while you sight-see and and watch the wildlife, chugging on your maple syrup and munching on your candy bars. There's really no wrong way to play this game! And hey, if you get bored, then stop by the forums here or on the hinterlands website and check out the various community challenges that people come up with. Quite a lot of them are really fun!One day, I'll write up a more organized and thorough review of this game. But, not today. The story mode is a great introduction to the mechanics of survival mode, but even if you don't really enjoy the story mode, really, go check out the survival. You won't regret it.";24 November, 2020;

I grinded through Wintermute to learn the fundamentals, before diving into Survival mode.I quickly became immersed. The game's mechanics are relatively simple. The crafting system is not complicated. After so much time, wildlife becomes predictable. Certain animals can only spawn in certain locations. Some days you just get stuck inside breaking down boxes and shelves to collect extra resources, hoping to find a couple extra cans of dog food. And yet, I was never bored.I managed to fully explore several locations. I built up an arsenal, learned to use weapons, mastered my strategy. Finally, after 150 in-game days, I took on a black bear and a moose--I killed both without getting a scratch. I decided to harvest the corpses on the spot, rather than quartering. After 3 days I still hadn't gotten all the meat back to base, and I took a lot of condition loss spending too much time in the cold.I had become confident and greedy. A wolf took me by surprise right outside my front door. I started bleeding out, and wouldn't you know it? I had harvested all of the cloth from my base and transported it elsewhere. I had one piece left in my inventory, but not enough time to make bandages. I completely forgot about the emergency stim I had been carrying throughout the entire game... And just like that, a run that lasted over 100 real hours came to an abrupt end.Here I am, laughing as I write this, and gearing up for a more challenging run.I'm picky about games. I don't play many of them. The ones I do play, though, I play religiously. I played other survival crafting games. But this one is different. You're not fighting zombies, raiding bases, building bases, farming or collecting loot for the sake of it. It doesn't feel cheap in that way. It's man versus nature. Your biggest obstacle is yourself.;10 November, 2022;
The Long Dark;Kain;1,022 products in account;592 people found this review helpful19 people found this review funny; Recommended 96.1 hrs on record;At first I was only interested for the story mode to come, but then friends kept bugging me about how amazing the sandbox was, I wasn't biting it, it's just a survival mode in which you know you WILL die, looks like a fancy score based game to me, compare inches of ???? by how long you can survive, but then articles kept coming, people still kept bugging me about how great the game was. Well, I decided to give it a chance before the final release to know what the fuss was all about. Man, it blew my mind.First of all, it's not a simple game of survival, watch meters and number dwindle down as you starve, get tired or dehydrated, although, there is plenty of that too. What's incredible is how contemplative it is, you're always on the look for something yes, you need to keep moving, keep exploring, the world isn't safe, it's dying and it wants you to join it, it feels sometimes the only true warmth you'll ever find is the embrace of death. Outside time leaps, everything you do takes precious time and sunlight, harvesting wood, exploring, getting from point A to B, you're always freezing or going hungry, but then you find shelter, and you like the character can rest.You still have to do something to be alive in a shelter, light a fire, cook food, boil water, but at least you can think, you can prepare your spirit for the terror outside. You have to survive, not because you want to prove something to anyone else, but out of spite, in a land that wants you dead, you want to rebel, you refuse to give up. But it's still respite, at a shelter you can think, plan your next day.In a way it reminds me of Hemingway's old man and the sea, it's about an internal struggle, even if nature gets the final say, you'll wont rest easy, you'll kick and scream and in that defiance you can have your final laugh.There is so much that can be said about this, even the play though that cemented my appreciation of this game could be a tale in itself, but for now it's enough, I wrote too much already.;1 April, 2017;

Yes... a very long time. Why? because this game is GREAT. Its the best Survival game you will find anywhere PERIOD. Realism, beauty, size, options, difficulty,... Its all there. Each update brings something new. Each region has its own soul. This game will not give you a free experience in a way its just gonna give you your win and send you off. This game is so strategic and original you will have to spend a LOT of time learning all the strategies to survive the apocalypse efficiently. That just makes it so much better. Its the apocalypse. Ofcourse its gonna be hard. Thats why its great. The pure satisfaction you gain after becoming good. its the type of game you spend alot of time on, than have yourself a break for few months and than you will come back once again because this game just has its own magic you wont find anywhere else. If you are into the more realistic Survival games, you will sink hundreds if not thousands of hours into this one since its just so catchy. And dont worry, this 1 is not your standard 25 to 50 hours to complete. You have Story, Challanges and to top it off Sandbox mode that can go on forever if you so please (and are skilled enough >:) ).If you are looking for a atmosferic long term survival journey, this is it. You dont need to look no further. You wont regret this purchase if you meet those criteria.(extra: sure, the game is is technically unfinnished Story wise, but thats due to it being in epizodic format. The Dlc that is being updated with new content is freemode based and is currently studios main focus.

LUNIA Z:Revival;???30;191 products in account;9 people found this review helpful; Recommended 30.8 hrs on record;Yep, Lunia is back.So far, seems to be kind of the same game as before, but with a little twist:The monsters are somewhat tougher, and takes longer to kill with basic attack.The tutorial itself displays an example of that, but sadly in that case, makes the tutorial experience extremelly annoying, since you'll keep mashing the same monster for a while to kill it.I believe that change to monsters health was made to incentivate coop gameplay, but the problem with that is the fact that the only moment I managed to get someone to join my lobby and play with, was when my brother was playing with me.If you played the old Lunia, then yes, the lags persist in this game. So far, the stage gameplay is still fun, but by experience, it's a lot better when you're playing with someone else. Do bring a friend or more to play with you if you want to try the game, because the combat gets dull when solo, because of the health change. A stage can end up taking way longer than should because you're trying to deal with a specific group of mobs.That doesn't mean things in the game are easy though, since even Episode 1 bosses can kick your ass with only one skill, so do watch yourself in the fights.The server itself seems to be intended for Brazillian players, since there's quite a lot of hints to that around the game, but bizarrelly, the interface is in english, but not the voice acting. So far, I haven't seen anyone from other parts of the world showing up in the chat.There's also quite a number of characters unlocked from start, compared to the previous servers, so at least you have quite a variety of gameplays to pick.The game does have its pitfalls on its returns, and it's based on leveling and stages.The stages unlocking are based on player level, and starting from after Episode 2, you'll no longer gain enough exp to level up for completting stages, so you'll be unable to keep doing the stages to progress in the game story for a while.At least on classic Lunia, you were able to still do stages even lower leveled, as long as you have completed the previous stage, which was not only fair but also interesting. Even the stages in each Episode which were made for people to keep doing them and gaining exp to level up are gone, for some reason, which makes it harder to continue the gameplay.At least doing daily missions for Carlos Perdal in the square helps a bit, but still, that's such a letdown that can make you stop playing by the day because there's not much you can do, since grinding stages isn't really what Lunia is about. And eventually the hosts give you exp rate increasing items, so if you feel like grinding for a few hours, pop a box with the item and grind stages for a few levels. Or go the slow mode and make your character do some fishing too.Also talking about stages, the difficulty of them seems messed up, and the most obvious moment you can see that is in the tutorial stage. Monsters can take way too many hits than necessary to die, and bosses can end up one hit killing you with their attacks, and that on Normal mode. Without counting that playing on difficulties higher than Easy, reduces the amount of lives you are given on the stage. Would be nice if those were tweaked, because the stages in the game are cool.Anyways, feel free to give it a go.If you want a tip, don't open the exp boxes until Episode 3.;4 August, 2023;

I had quite a lot of fun playing it back in the day and I'd love to see an spiritual successor or even a sequel - but this isn't one, no matter how much it claims to be.As mentioned by other reviewers, this is just a rerelease of the original Lunia but with screwed up balancing and unnecessary reworks. Actually, it's not even clear VALOFE holds the rights to publish the game. So it's well possible this is just a south american private server taking the disguise of an international rerelease.;7 August, 2023;

Trying to revive Lunia in Lunia Z mean A LOT of content has been removed.I've played and enjoyed the game from its original release up to its closure and the whole evolution had its positives and negatives.In this Lunia Revival Z they've removed the rebirth system along with rebirth skills and myth related content (stages, raids, dungeons. etc) and that isn't exactly a bad thing itself since at least no playable characters were removed from the game.To sum it up, this state of the game is meant for players drived not only by nostalgia of the game itself but also by nostalgia of a specific state of the game, so it is not the same game everyone has played.As to me, I can't say I've enjoyed played the current grind fiesta and unnecessary ramp up in monsters HP and damage since it only makes the whole processes of leveling a character more time consumpting and tedious in earlier stages of the game.";22 October, 2023;

Zorro The Chronicles;Jack;NOT INFORMED;48 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny; Recommended 24.6 hrs on record;Ever since I became a Zorro fan back in 2010, I always wanted a fun video game experience of the franchise. Zorro as a character is perfect for a video game, but for some reason, every attempt to make one, from the 80's, 90's, 2000's and 2010's, has been a flop. Each of them struggled how to make a compelling swashbuckling game experience, and to capture the spirit of the franchise.Zorro: The Chronicles, released today, solves every problem with Zorro video games. Based on the 2015 cartoon of the same name, I was initially cautious but optimistic for it's release, especially after it was delayed. But now that it's come out, I can safely say this is not only a really fun Zorro experience for adults, but it could be the definitive Zorro experience for children ages 6-11. It's also really fun for fans of games like the Batman Arkham franchise, or Assassin's Creed.PROS:The swordplay is buttery-smooth. Attacking, blocking, rolling, finishers and parries all have a place in the game, and fighting enemies isn't too easy or too hard.Zorro: The Chronicles has an amazing stealth system that offers unique challenges and puzzles to players, encouraging them to think smarter, not harder, and evade the enemy.The game has a charming sense of humor that while not laugh-out-loud funny, is sure to bring out a few chuckles.Diverse enemy types allow for the game to have unique challenges, as well as giving the super move function a very handy utility.CONS:No voice acting, which makes the world feel a little less aliveNo co-op/multiplayer functions, which makes games way less fun for the familyA little overpriced. If you want, wait for a sale.Ultimately, I recommend you get this game, as it is a huge blast to play, with very few flaws. Until next time amigos, ADIOS!;16 June, 2022;

Zorro The Chronicles;Press;NOT INFORMED;28 people found this review helpful; Recommended 1.7 hrs on record;Zorro The Chronicles is a game aimed at the young audience that is familiar with the animated series but as well as entertaining for older generations, I admit I watched zorro as a kid, who wouldn't, right?The game is quite simple and you can easily understand everything.Be careful though because if you do everything too fast you could make a mistake and have to redo part of the level.Watch gameplay with both characters here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwQifjSM6-YAs the video made clear, there are two characters to choose from per level, zorro and ines.The game is based on an animated series that appeared several years ago.The series showed a young hero who fought against evil together with his twin sister Ines and the game follows the same formula and you can play as one of these two heroes.There are guards in various places that you have to fight with, but you can also avoid them by sneaking smartly via a safe route, but this is not always possible.It is clearly explained how to fight and which moves you can make. Hilarity ensues when Zorro causes the guards to stand in their underpants with their pants around their ankles or with the many other attack animations.During the game you can collect points with which you can eventually buy various moves. This makes you even stronger in the game!The game also has good support for ultra-wide resolutions, you can see a gameplay preview at 3840*1080 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJHwNs25gl4;29 August, 2022;

Zorro The Chronicles;Upward;NOT INFORMED;24 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 14.4 hrs on record;"Zorro: The Chronicles has fun, albeit incredibly simplistic combat, but suffers immensely from a tremendously low budget, meaning a near complete lack of cutscenes, a very short length at about 4.5 hours, and it graphically looks like a PS2 title (no this is not an exaggeration).The good news is it's a drastic improvement over the last Zorro game, The Wii exclusive ""The Destiny of Zorro"", although I still believe that dumpster fire is the worst game ever made, so it's not exactly hard to beat that.The combat is, as stated before, fun, but incredibly simplistic. It feels like a Assassin's Creed knockoff, but... it works, so I can't really complain. The game is very, VERY easy on normal difficulty though.The story is almost non-existent however. You do get some text before each mission describing your objective, but it feels very inconsequential and low stakes. There's a near complete lack of cutscenes, which I assume is due to budget constraints (more on that later).Graphically, Zorro: The Chronicles looks terrible. It really does look like a game that released in 2002. Again, presumably budget constraints.Which kind of sums up how I feel about this game really, it's serviceable but feels incredibly low budget and is very short. Zorro is one of my favorite characters in fiction and it's sad that again and again, Zorro games miss the mark.For what it is, Zorro: The Chronicles is not terrible, but is probably only worth about $5 to Zorro diehards and for anyone else, doesn't do anything to stand out to earn a recommendation at all.4/10.";18 June, 2022;

Contagion;the;NOT INFORMED;480 people found this review helpful18 people found this review funny; Recommended 37.8 hrs on record;I've played this game on and off and I feel like its time for a review after spending some of my time on this game.Summary:This is just your typical cliche zombie survival game where your basic objective is to survive (Duh!). You select from a handful of characters to decide who you want to be and go straight to business. shooting zombies and people. There are different modes in the game in which you can play: Escape, hunt, and extract.Escape:This is the primary mode that this game was probably built for. It is purely PvE where players come together to find a way out of a selected environment. There are different difficulties to test your skills in both individual and team gameplay. What I found really unique and interesting in this mode was that everytime you played it, it was always some what different every run. Your pathing to the ending of each map was usually different and this somewhat made the game mode fresh everytime. What I found to be a failure in this mode was that the ending of escape was always the same and my incentive to play again was minimal. There are no rewards for completing and it gets really repititive. Basically all you did was shoot zombies, find objectives, and get out. Another thing was how it could be absurdly difficult at times. Although this was also a reason as to why it was somewhat fun, a lot of the time you would find yourself back tracking to find missing objectives or paths to work your way to the end, all the while wasting ammo on zombies because you had no choice. Another thing was that players could turn into zombies if they were attacked or dead. I could see how dead players who turned to zombies could potentially create a left 4 dead PvP scene where teamwork is key, but the problem is that zombie players could single-handedly wipe out a whole team of players because thats just how strong and difficult a zombie player is to handle (I literally just walk in zig zags and no one could kill me and I would just kill them in like 5 hits). This adds to frustration of playing this mode as if looking for objectives while fighting AI zombies wasn't already a chore. My suggestion would to make this purely PvE and leave PvP for hunt and extract, which I will discuss about next.Hunt:If all you want to do is walk around and shoot people or be a zombies and kill people, this is the mode for you. It is purely PvP. Everyone starts out with a basic secondary weapon (handgun) and melee weapon and have to search for weapons that can be found in various areas across a map. While doing so, players will encounter eachother and kill eachother. But again, it can feel repetitive as the sole purpose of this mode is to just walk around killing eachother (Of if you like the classic camping you can do that too);31 October, 2014;
Contagion;A;NOT INFORMED;245 people found this review helpful10 people found this review funny; Not Recommended 98.1 hrs on record;I have had this game for years now and here are a few things on why this game is bad. You may skip this review thinking I'm angry at it, but I'm actually disappointed.First, the game was in early access in 2013. I've spent the last 4 years patiently waiting for what I thought would be an eventual full release. I turns out, the full release was in 2014. In the state that it was in 2014, it was very incomplete and very broken. Now, it still seems incomplete with one of the game modes being in beta for almost 2 years now.Second, the game devs simply don't care anymore. The last time they said anything on steam about the game was last halloween in 2016. This game is still incomplete and they haven't said anything in over a year. This is bad for their community engagement. If they are going to treat the player base like this, what's the point of making the game.Finally, the game is very much dead. The matchmaking is virtually empty, there are sh*t loads of modded servers with crappy modifications, the player zombie is overpowered (player respawning as zombies in the first place is a huge problem to begin with for a realistic zombie game), and starting a match without a private server or lan as an option makes it impossible to play with friends.To be honest, it is a very fun game. But unfortunately, the devs don't care anymore, the game is still incomplete, and the player base is almost non-existent. It is worth it if you can set up a lan party with friends that live nearby, but otherwise not worth the purchase at this point.This is simply not how you should treat your game or your player base.;22 December, 2017;

However, the company never actually completed the game for some reason, and instead just left it to wither and die. What a shame, and a terribly missed opportunity for greatness. But as stated, it is very limited and incomplete. Because of this, of course I cannot recommend it. In all fairness it should be removed from the Steam Store, as it is being sold as a finished game, when clearly it is not, and that kids, is what we call “fraud”.;27 May, 2017;

Its for the achievement showcase art. You can view my profile to see exactly what I am talking about, so if you are looking for a real game this is not it, so save yourself the couple bucks, BUT, if you want to make some cool achievement showcase ""welcome"" text or whatever, then for sure pick this up. Took me .7 hours to unlock all the achievements I needed!";12 December, 2022;

Zup! Z;Ghostie;6,806 products in account;20 people found this review helpful; Recommended 4.2 hrs on record;Classic 'Zup' gameplay - simple physics and timing based puzzles presented with polished and sleek visuals.Expect between one and two hours worth of levels of clicking explosives until the 'unique ball' reaches the goal. There is just the right amount of challenge that you may take a few tries to complete a level but never too much to give up.;16 March, 2022;
